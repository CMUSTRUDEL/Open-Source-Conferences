Title: Joelle Maslak - "You’re Not Wanted Here!"
Publication date: 2018-06-19
Playlist: TPC 2018 in SLC
Description: 
	How do you tell someone they aren’t wanted, in the new, interconnected world in which we live? Learn from successful examples of exclusion how you can build sites to keep disabled people, women, the LGBT community, people from nations you don’t care about, and others from having a positive experience with your application. With luck, those pesky outsiders will get the hint and go elsewhere, and your homogenous team can continue to only think about people like yourselves! This talk will be useful for anyone that may have design input into computer applications, regardless of experience level. While this talk will use Perl for some examples, most of the content will be understandable by people without any Perl background. (Note: This talk is intended to use irony and sarcasm to help people understand how to build applications that have the widest possible audience, so while it will present the topic as a way of excluding people, the intent is that you would do the opposite!)

well thank you everyone for coming to

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,099
this presentation hopefully you're in

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,050
the right place

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,440
well maybe not because you're not wanted

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,480
here I I feel kind of bad giving this

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,000
presentation right after Ruth's

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,420
presentation on inclusion and such and

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,430
well now will exclude that was the

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,960
original idea what this presentation was

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,730
to present kind of the converse how

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,070
would you build a discriminatory out as

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,539
I was doing the work I just couldn't do

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,430
that so I'm going to talk about how to

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,670
build an inclusive app not how to build

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,890
an exclusive app so sorry if anyone was

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,120
looking forward to the other but you can

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,280
probably figure it out a little about

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:49,399
myself I being a pearl developer since

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:52,260
1995 first program I wrote was in 1982 I

00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,989
was a very important program it

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,610
displayed my name on the screen your

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,910
five-year-old girl that's important to

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:04,260
you first UNIX was a UX has anyone used

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:06,200
a UX awesome that's awesome

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:13,280
most people don't even know what it is

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:16,830
it was OS X before OS X long before OS X

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,220
first Linux I've used with Slackware 1:1

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,560
and when you Slackware 1-0 ah

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,820
so people have been at longer than me

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,979
good deal

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,540
first Sipan module I wrote was a few

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,400
years ago Acme Unicode if I and it takes

00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,500
Latin text converts it to sort of

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,509
look-alike character so you can pass to

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,920
test routines and that type of thing not

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,680
terribly useful

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,320
I made a more useful one later that I'm

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,759
more proud of of parallel work unit does

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:51,229
several different paradigms of

00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:54,840
parallelism for via fork ID in Perl 5 I

00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:56,340
have a lot of opinions just like

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,170
everyone else go and say they're not my

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:03,750
employer so please please PLEASE

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,799
complain to me not to them so topic is

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,439
going to be white why does

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,090
discriminatory design happen what why do

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,590
people do this and people aren't doing

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,970
this because they say they wake up in

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,380
the morning they say I want to exclude

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,210
most of the world from using my

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,900
application or buying my product or

00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:22,870
being part of my community it's just

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,310
simply it's really really hard to

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,590
include the hundred percent I give this

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,020
example where even the five percent is

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,570
hard because a lot of applications and

00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,010
in this area most of us probably live in

00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,450
the u.s. probably work for a US company

00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,390
a lot of us work for companies that

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,890
focus mainly on US customers okay so

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,310
that four point three percent of the

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,440
world eight percent of people in the US

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,560
according to census they will say they

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,320
don't speak or write English well

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,780
so you're most most applications in the

00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,240
u.s. exclude that eight percent you

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,260
don't speak English the application

00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,290
probably doesn't cater to you

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,350
unfortunately twenty five percent of

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,490
Americans don't have a credit card and

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,470
that's interesting because how many

00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,209
things do you buy online that need a

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,700
credit card how many applications and

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:11,650
services need a credit card and then

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,350
thirty percent of Americans do not have

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,240
internet at home so you out all this up

00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,370
and it comes out to be most of the

00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,260
applications US companies are designing

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,570
at best two point one percent of the

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,100
world so that's also of the converse

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:28,120
there is a huge business case for

00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:30,310
expanding this if you're making money at

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,080
two percent 12.1 percent of the world

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,650
you could make a lot of money yet

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,019
ninety-eight percent of the world so

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,930
first thing I get when I talk about this

00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:44,530
to people is well we only do business in

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,630
the USA we don't really we just made the

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,090
business decision we're going to do it

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,730
in the USA so I want to find out what

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:56,040
that means so I go out to Google shows

00:03:51,730 --> 00:04:00,070
me this map anyone see some issues there

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:03,220
Alaska and Hawaii yeah Puerto Rico's

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:05,790
they're Mexico is also they're Cuba's

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,989
also they're a bunch of Canada's they're

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,959
several other countries are on there so

00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:15,299
it's an interesting response from Google

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,650
I found of course as people pointed out

00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,900
not these people and that's kind of

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,000
that's kind of two symbol I it

00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,340
symbolizes the problem we have with

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,820
designing software's a lot of times we

00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,030
just don't think

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,040
of the people we're excluding definitely

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:35,930
not all these these are all the US

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:38,240
territories in possessions and usually

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,520
when people talk about America they they

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,950
want to leave Puerto Rico off anyway so

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,110
even Google's trying to do it they price

00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,450
you just cross it out for us and we

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:50,150
certainly when we talk about Americans

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,010
we're not talking about these people the

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,950
people on the Left they're the research

00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:57,530
station in Antarctica the people on the

00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,970
right that's the and I won't comment on

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:08,500
the architectural style but that's the

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:11,150
new US Embassy in London yeah all over

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,660
it's it's a it's a big deal so it's and

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:18,680
it's not just geography there's other

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:21,770
aspects of this physical disabilities

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,630
and this is a ramp someone put in they

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:31,940
wanted to make sure they were ad a

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:34,190
compliance yeah I'm probably not much

00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,080
else I mean they did put grip strips on

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:40,940
it

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:43,010
just kind of consider it we're there

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,420
first thing when you're designing an

00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,890
application you're designing and you're

00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,140
trying to include all people you have to

00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,520
include all people some of those people

00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,640
are going to have physical disabilities

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,260
and there's a couple different kinds of

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,560
physical disabilities you might want to

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,450
think about because you can't design one

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,380
application interface and expect it to

00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:05,720
work for everyone one one type of

00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,970
physical mobility issue might be someone

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,120
that has a hard time making accurate

00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:13,430
movements so they might be a move a

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,900
pointer stick or eye gaze or something

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,060
along those lines

00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,700
where if you have a little teeny tiny

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,590
button or icon that they're supposed to

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:25,730
click that's going to be very difficult

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:28,310
for those users there's another group of

00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,680
users that almost exactly the opposite

00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,570
need they can make the fine movements

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,700
but they have trouble making large

00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:38,090
movements so if you have an interface

00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,210
that has has them scrolling all over the

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,789
screen

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,289
top to bottom left to right clicking on

00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:45,569
different tabs that interface can be

00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:47,819
very difficult for them so for the first

00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:49,590
group of people you might want an

00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,000
interface with lots of tabs because you

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,680
don't want lock controls on one page

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,960
that's an example if you're doing let's

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,849
say a web application or a phone

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,060
application for the second group of

00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:01,560
people you want a lot of controls on one

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,300
page because you want to minimize how

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,740
often they have to move that Mouse from

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,080
say the bottom of the page all the way

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,970
up to the top to select another control

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,419
so that's part of the thinking about

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,220
this is there's not necessarily one one

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:15,930
perfect solution that's going to work

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,520
for everyone it's going to be a

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,610
combination of tools and in

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,070
customization I'll give some examples

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,190
here are things that that you can do I

00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,690
minimize scrolling part of that is

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,550
providing keyboard alternatives

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,699
sometimes a lot of times keyboard is

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:36,470
actually quicker than then the scrolling

00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:38,250
for some people touch or Mouse targets

00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,729
generally should be at least large

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,470
enough that people can reliably hit them

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:46,680
even even people that might have a

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:49,919
physical disability timeouts on forms

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,870
can be a really big issue if it takes

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,570
you five times as long to fill out the

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,460
form and you go through all the trouble

00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,659
filling out you hit submit and it tells

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,469
you a timed out you're going to be

00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:03,539
pretty darn frustrated back button

00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:05,190
refreshment reset everything hopefully

00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:09,180
anyone that's a web designer knows that

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:11,610
but I run into it all the time still and

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,490
as I said before different physical

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,199
abilities require different interfaces

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,270
sometimes and there's actually some work

00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,830
going on very interesting work to do

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,789
this programmatically to be have

00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,349
redefined your interface

00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:28,020
programmatically for different abilities

00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:30,300
this is an example of I mean select your

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,419
year not too bad if you're a typical

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,919
Mouse user now I bet if I went to

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,140
Facebook on my phone they wouldn't give

00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,719
me this interface in this way because

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:43,020
that would be impossible to use on a

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,490
phone but that's not something to think

00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,810
about there one saving grace here is you

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:50,730
can type in 1992 and it'll pull up 1992

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,900
and it will work you don't need to use

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,790
the selector the

00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,310
name that's that's a little bigger of an

00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,470
issue so it's things to think about is

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,990
that that's stuff we take for granted

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,360
but it's not necessarily accessible

00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,270
there's some other problems on this page

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,000
but we'll talk about them in a minute

00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:11,620
I'm trying to I tried to pick sites that

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
had nothing do with any of the sponsors

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,470
or anyone that I know comes to this

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,480
conference so I apologize if you work

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:22,630
for Facebook I do have some cute puppy

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:26,560
pictures I had to put them in their age

00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:28,840
is another factor that you should

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,030
consider a lot of a lot of applications

00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,830
just the default people assume is a teen

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:35,080
they can sign a contract so they can

00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:37,300
sign up for my service it's not the case

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,550
it depends on where you are in the world

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,810
where they are age of majority is not

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,660
always 18 I can give you a couple

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:49,410
examples Saudi Arabia age of majority is

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:52,540
15 in Kuwait age of majority is 21

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:55,570
Mississippi it's 21 so it very much

00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:58,080
depends on where where they are and

00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:01,450
where you're doing business of course

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,740
minors can be emancipated meaning that

00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,940
they have the rights of an adult they

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:09,070
can have that happen before they're 18

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:13,420
so one thing to think about is how do

00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:15,040
you include those people one of the

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,750
things I always find interesting is the

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,760
number of sites that soon no one lives

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:23,130
past the hundred it's kind of depressing

00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,130
I always wanted to live to 101 at least

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,330
different age groups use technology

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:32,200
differently and they also use different

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:34,240
technology it's I think everyone in here

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,860
knows some age groups might be more

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,020
likely to access the internet on their

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,150
phone other age groups might be more act

00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:44,890
likely ask access on say a desktop

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:47,500
computer I'm one of my pet peeves as I'm

00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,810
I'm getting older is 25 year old

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,860
developers can read really tiny font I

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:57,220
can't a lot of other people can't either

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:59,380
and it's I see that and I say okay I

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:03,340
know no one on that team is older than

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:05,060
about 40 probably not older than 30 all

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,250
right

00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:10,190
and then last kind of question is

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:14,090
security questions that assume youth

00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:15,380
I'll give you an example this security

00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,810
question might be where did you meet

00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,240
your spouse well if you only have one

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,590
spouse and you've only ever had one

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,130
spouse in your life that's an easy

00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:26,870
question to answer I if you're older and

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:30,500
maybe things didn't work out you have a

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,910
second spouse which spouse you're going

00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,550
to have to remember that 20 years from

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:39,470
now which spouse you initially signed up

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:42,170
to the site with now I mentioned the

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:45,520
hundred and one-year-old thing no no one

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:50,390
that olds going use user site of course

00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:54,250
this is the AARP that's the American

00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:56,420
Association of Retired Persons and so

00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:01,030
yeah you're not going to use it if

00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:05,420
you're a hundred and one apparently not

00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:13,190
but don't worry you can sign up if

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:16,730
you're new board the other area we often

00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:20,120
take for granted is computer knowledge

00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,500
and we assume what things mean and we

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,710
assume that everyone else has seen it of

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:27,350
course most developers most people

00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,090
creating technology we use technology a

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,740
lot so we get exposed to it we don't

00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,440
remember the first time we saw a plus

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,980
box and didn't realize that expands a

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,570
section out so we can see the details

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,160
these are actual examples I got from

00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,290
other people that are non-technical

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,430
people I said what are some things you

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,080
have problems in computing they said I

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,150
don't know what this dot dot dot thing

00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:51,890
does it's a button with a dot dot dot X

00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:53,480
so what the heck's a dot dot dot gooeys

00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:56,600
being more friendly that's kind of the

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,430
Assumption they look nice but if the

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,020
thoughts not put into how a user is

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,470
going use it it's not necessarily more

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,720
friendly I give this example of this

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,370
weird-looking inverted L with an arrow

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,360
in the corner there this is from

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:13,100
PowerPoint and I know that means show

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,730
you more details about this kind of

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,620
thing but a lot of people don't if I

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,940
threw that out of context

00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,100
where you didn't see it in the ribbon I

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:25,000
bet you wouldn't most people probably

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,000
wouldn't know what it is

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:32,540
examples of modern application design

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,980
I'd be really impressed if someone could

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,980
tell me what every one of those is

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:44,720
another area of Technology where we

00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:48,650
unwillingly discriminate is is the

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,660
financial side I it kind of astonishes

00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:53,120
me when I go to a big department store I

00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,370
have my cart loaded up with stuff I'm

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,100
ready to check out and I can't find

00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,770
anyone to check me out or there's one

00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,600
line with 30 people in it

00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,580
to check me out I'm thinking this is the

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,870
easy part all you have to do is take my

00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,090
money I already know what I want

00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,830
I I have everything I want you've done

00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,750
all the sale work and now you're going

00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,220
to lose me as a customer because I'm

00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,310
gonna have to stand in line for an hour

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,080
to buy the stuff are you kidding but a

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,790
lot of times in technology we do the

00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,350
same thing we make assumptions that

00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,830
everyone has a credit card or a cell

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,480
phone not everyone does we make

00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:30,350
assumptions that people everyone has a

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:34,090
bank account again not everyone does or

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:36,890
even a home address not everyone does

00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:39,290
one that I've seen a lot when I travel

00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,450
in Europe is the assumption el credit

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,580
cards have chip-and-pin us we have chip

00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,200
we don't have pin you'd have to ask the

00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,500
bank's why that makes sense I don't know

00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:52,250
either but that's that's just the

00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,690
reality postal codes are another example

00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,340
you might have seen this if you've ever

00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,980
traveled to another country and tried

00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,410
filling up with gas and the gas pump

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,340
asking you any or your postal code

00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:03,410
particular if you're coming to the u.s.

00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:06,650
because we'll give you a nice numeric

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:09,770
keypad with no letters on it and you've

00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:16,760
got to put your your your postal code in

00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:21,890
there well good luck I'm bad design next

00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:24,410
year before I get one yep

00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,940
case stays Amtrak Amtrak thought they

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,020
found a way save a bunch of money that's

00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,510
our National Railroad

00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:31,690
uh-huh or what passes for a National

00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,980
Railroad here

00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,150
everyone buys tickets online is what

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,830
they said they probably looked and they

00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,110
probably said 90 something percent of

00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:42,260
people buy tickets online we can convert

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,940
the rest over well they made some

00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,070
assumptions they made assumptions that

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,640
everyone had internet that everyone had

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,640
a credit card

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,240
West Virginia Senate delegation

00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,800
complained they raised the red flag and

00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,680
said a good chunk of our state we're a

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,360
rural state there is not pervasive

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,060
internet high-speed Internet in our

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,620
state unfortunately we also have people

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:08,090
that do take the train that want to pay

00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:09,590
in cash or have to pay in cash as you

00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,630
can see from that news update

00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,270
Amtrak's looking at trying to how

00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,280
they're going bring these people back

00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:20,980
not not the cost-saving move they hoped

00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:22,820
it to be talked a little earlier about

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,330
physical disabilities there's also

00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:29,840
sensory disabilities blindness deafness

00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:31,850
in others don't require typical vision

00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,050
in your app and some of that is just

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,180
making sure it works with a screen

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,890
reader and so if you haven't actually

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,690
used the screen reader and tried using

00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:41,330
your app that would probably be the

00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:43,160
first thing to do but some other tips

00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:46,220
just to help everyone out because not

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,950
everyone that has vision issues use a

00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,170
screen reader use good contrast be

00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,450
careful when you're doing very similar

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,960
colors on top of each other

00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,400
avoid small fonts of course and I say

00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,290
use alt tags but depends on your

00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,460
technology what kind of platform you're

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,900
on what kind of interface you're

00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,370
building what

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,990
whether alt tags make sense whether

00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,450
audio prompts might make sense

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:11,180
it depends what you're building for

00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:12,620
audio provide captions so that people

00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,080
can take advantage of that that helps

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,520
not only people that can't hear helps

00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,630
people there at their workplace maybe

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,730
don't want to disturb all their

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,170
co-workers it helps people in noisy

00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,660
environments it helps people to have

00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:28,550
that don't know your language as well as

00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:29,840
maybe you do and then lastly as avoid

00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,940
color is so a way of conveying

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,680
information I'll give a very good bad

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,100
example here is the game of Trivial

00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,440
Pursuit they that game uses a lot of

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,470
colors to differentiate thing and if

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,100
you're have some colorblindness

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,330
depending what kind of colorblindness

00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:51,769
you have that can be

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:55,789
problem yeah at least you have

00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:57,710
positional on a vertical one right and

00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:02,600
now horizontal or Azam one's a bad

00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:04,669
design yeah absolutely

00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,019
this is an example of an air face I've

00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:09,200
had two of buscetta

00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:11,419
the content of it but this is a graph

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,220
trying to show something and it

00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:14,440
programmatically picks colors for the

00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,960
different things and it picked some

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:20,480
awfully similar colors for some of them

00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,090
but if you click on one of those in the

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,610
legend it's not a good interface because

00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,870
that's hard that was hard to discover

00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:29,169
it's like secret knowledge around my

00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,850
workplace at that interface does that

00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:34,519
but once you discover it you say oh I

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:37,190
can change that item to whatever color I

00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:39,529
want I can make these readable and the

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:41,539
great thing with that is it doesn't

00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:43,909
depend on the computer guessing all the

00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:47,029
possible ways that you might have

00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:49,010
trouble seeing the colors so that's just

00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:50,120
I throw that up as an example of how do

00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,289
you work around this how do you build

00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,389
interface how do you build one that

00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:56,840
everyone finds useful how many times

00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:58,669
have you put a graph together and maybe

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,970
your graphing your company in a

00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:04,220
competitor and your company uses red as

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,870
its primary logo color the other company

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,549
uses blue so you'd like the red line to

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,919
be you the blue line to be a competitor

00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:13,399
but Excel decided to switch those around

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:17,899
on you this is this is how you avoid

00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:20,570
that type of problem we mentioned

00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:25,539
earlier the geography issue and this

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:27,529
often pops up with addresses you can't

00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:30,049
there's a bunch of assumptions people

00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:32,059
make about people's addresses that don't

00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:34,159
work in real life first of all is that

00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:35,960
you can map people to do the space that

00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,850
you can have a coordinate system

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,580
basically allowed to longitude with

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,159
enough decimals and map where people

00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,730
let's say where they live primarily

00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:45,799
can't do that

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,750
Google tried it just recently and they

00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:51,309
made a big fanfare about it and said we

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:54,049
created this Universal coordinate system

00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:55,910
apparently no one at Google lives in an

00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:59,520
apartment building

00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:01,140
the addresses don't all have the same

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,020
parts I've seen a lot of forms they'll

00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,470
ask for a name then street and street

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,780
number

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,250
not everyone litt has lives on a street

00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,070
with a number some people might live

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,809
example might be a college dormitory you

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:16,559
might live in Hill Hall and there's no

00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:19,440
street numbers just Hill Hall another

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,780
example is providing one or two lines

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,080
for addresses some people actually have

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:26,850
longer addresses and this is mostly

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,059
us-based other countries might have

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,799
different standards but regardless make

00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:33,179
sure you know what the variation can be

00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:37,470
and it's probably a lot more variation

00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:40,679
than you expect street city and building

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,960
names change for instance town where in

00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,650
wasn't always seen a Salt Lake City does

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,270
anyone know what used to be I don't know

00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:52,710
if whoever was Deseret but it was Great

00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:54,720
Salt Lake City so that's an example

00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,760
that's a relatively minor one I imagine

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,380
you address your mail to Great Salt Lake

00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,630
City it probably still gets here and

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,140
that was done quite some time ago more

00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:05,910
recent one was Coal Creek Tennessee I

00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,710
renamed itself to Lake City for a while

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:12,020
decided they didn't like Lake City

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,020
either renamed themselves to Rocky Top

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,450
how many applications would treat that

00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:21,630
name as we better validate that this

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,830
person's real all over again they didn't

00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,490
move they nothing changed with them

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:28,620
their city changed another example of

00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:32,400
this would be a building named after

00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:35,280
someone we have a building in near

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,760
Denver the Arapahoe County Detention

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,830
Facility the jail it was named after a

00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,540
former sheriff that was still living

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,790
probably shouldn't name things after

00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:48,210
living living people because he was

00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:51,120
caught involved in some meth trade uh he

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:53,970
was thrown into his own Jail they've

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,570
since renamed the jail so building names

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,570
do change

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:08,880
I mean that's 200 years old there right

00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:14,669
yes so even even dead people aren't safe

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:16,770
if they're the wrong dead people allow

00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:18,809
new construction I ran into this when I

00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:21,000
was trying by phone service a few years

00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:23,549
ago I was living in a new apartment

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,919
building it was built in the last year I

00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:27,690
called up the phone company I said I

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,280
need phone service I live at this

00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,730
address

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:34,290
building 32 apartment 205 main there's a

00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,840
pause and then the person on the other

00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:40,470
end line says are you sure you don't

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,390
live in building 37 yeah well I was sure

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,980
I didn't live in building 37 and if

00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,000
there's a building 37 it kind of makes

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:50,250
sense there's probably a building 32 but

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,809
it it took several layers of escalation

00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:54,360
they dropped the ticket several times

00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:58,110
when they tried to establish my phone

00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,700
service and eventually they got that

00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,350
solved but then I ran into the next

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,830
problem and this is the last thing don't

00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:07,679
don't infer city from postal code zip

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:10,620
code doesn't mean city cities don't have

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,010
cities are not mapped one too many zip

00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,880
codes

00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:17,610
it's a many-to-many mapping I lived in

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,700
superior Colorado that shared a zip code

00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:23,940
with Louisville Colorado well the phone

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,010
company couldn't find that apartment

00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:30,450
complex in Louisville Colorado so they

00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:33,179
closed the installation order as address

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:36,440
doesn't exist eventually I was able to

00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,440
get work through I got a cell phone

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,999
I'm not going comment

00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:55,339
I currently work for CenturyLink by the

00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:58,759
way no I different division so people

00:23:55,339 --> 00:24:00,559
move as well this is off of ebay a page

00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:02,419
they have that explains the different

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,460
kinds of addresses they have on their

00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:07,580
site five different kinds of addresses

00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,330
so you move you go to ebay you change

00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,719
your address

00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,940
well did you change in all five spots

00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:14,869
because yeah you changed your

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,879
registration address but we're going to

00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:19,729
ship your stuff to your old address

00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:21,289
still one way you solve this kind of

00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:22,429
promise there's there's legitimate needs

00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:25,190
why people might have different

00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:27,559
addresses this was all created for

00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:29,239
legitimate business purposes but if

00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,309
someone changes an address in your

00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:32,599
interface at least tell them that

00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:34,489
there's these other things I exist

00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:40,549
ideally maybe even ask them do you want

00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:42,519
to change your other addresses too does

00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:48,159
anyone know who this lady is

00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:52,070
yeah you know what she invented sort of

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:55,009
yeah frequency hopping and specifically

00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:58,399
time based frequency hopping that's used

00:24:55,009 --> 00:25:00,710
in Wi-Fi it's used in Bluetooth used in

00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:03,469
a lot of modern technology wasn't really

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:06,289
recognized as particularly important at

00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:08,779
the time she invented it unfortunately

00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:14,269
and she never got any money for it she's

00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:15,799
better known as a actress knowledge is

00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:17,809
an area where we can have a

00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:20,919
discriminatory application I show her

00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:23,629
cuz obviously she has a lot of knowledge

00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,279
when you ask people to enter information

00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:27,139
into a form field tell them where they

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,419
can get that information particularly if

00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:32,599
it's something that's not a commonly

00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:34,879
known piece of information when I'm at

00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:37,639
an employment site and asked me for my

00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:39,499
employee number I might not know my

00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:41,509
employee number I might not even know I

00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:46,519
had an employee number where do I find

00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:49,099
that define your acronyms this is one

00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:50,450
way I contribute to open source is when

00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:55,440
I'm reading a man page and someone

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:58,139
refers to an API or some other

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,669
acronym it's a really simple poll

00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:01,830
request to go in there and define that

00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:03,720
term right at the spot so that that new

00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:06,000
person coming in that hasn't been in

00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,860
computers for twenty years doesn't know

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,429
what an api yet at least knows what

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:13,350
you're talking about I give some

00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:15,149
examples here of industry terms to avoid

00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:18,120
these are things I saw in actual

00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:19,950
websites inner ABA routing number that

00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,299
was that's a check routing number in the

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:28,110
u.s. American Banking Association very

00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:30,659
few people are going know that API gave

00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,279
that as an example avatar that's very

00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,590
popular unfortunately in some of our

00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,000
community sites and such but if you

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:39,559
don't know what that is you don't know

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,600
what it is so make sure you define it

00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:44,879
one of my pet peeves is I'm using an

00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,039
application it doesn't work or a tool or

00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:49,529
something else I go to try filing a bug

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,850
and you also see the same thing with

00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:53,580
phone tree when you need to call support

00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:56,370
on something and press 1 for this press

00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,950
2 for this press 3 for this well none of

00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:02,190
those it's something else and I can't

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,960
get through to someone make it easy to

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,279
file bugs use the support forms

00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,500
sometimes that means you'll have to have

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,559
someone routed initially you're not

00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,970
going to be a lot or route everything

00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:13,320
and then finally with the knowledge

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,720
don't exclude newcomers this is

00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:19,529
particularly important in our open

00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,299
source communities make it easy for

00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:23,100
people to join don't create a lot of

00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,929
barriers of knowledge to get started

00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,740
don't require them to understand the

00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:30,539
whole system before they can do anything

00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,120
this is an example of some examples I've

00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:34,620
seen in the workplace this was at a

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,820
large enterprise and not where I work

00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:41,490
now and there was a central IT

00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,500
department that did the DNS system for

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:45,960
the organization there's also

00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,850
distributed IT so when some department

00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,830
got a server they would install the

00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,110
server and then they would fill out a

00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:55,110
form to get the DNS entry at its point

00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:57,629
at that server unfortunately some of the

00:27:55,110 --> 00:28:00,480
IT people weren't DNS experts Sadie and

00:27:57,629 --> 00:28:01,769
I'll fill out the form that complaint

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,710
got bubbled up through the organization

00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:06,299
got to a manager and the manager went to

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,530
the guy that ran the DNS system and says

00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:09,730
you have to put some explanation

00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,160
this form so people know what you're

00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,300
asking for so he did he said if you

00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,170
don't have fill out this form please

00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:20,230
consult DNS and bind blah blah blah he

00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,880
even gave a link to the it was a card

00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,620
catalog basically system for the

00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,250
organization's library so you could in

00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:29,440
her office order the book so apparently

00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:31,210
his plan was you'd order the book wait

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,640
for it to arrive hopefully no one else

00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:36,820
checked it out read the 500 pages and

00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:40,600
then you'd be em say yes I want 1.2.3.4

00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:44,530
to be phu kham that's a bad example

00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,540
don't do that bug trackers are another

00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:49,870
example I mean you start by calling

00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:51,070
everything a ticket what's a ticket it's

00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:54,070
what you get it from a police officer

00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:56,590
right well a lot of bug trackers call

00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:58,360
everything a ticket to that might be

00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:02,290
fine on the back end it's not fine in

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:04,120
front of your users make the user select

00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:08,740
from confusing categories or understand

00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:10,660
the internals the best part is when it's

00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,000
a very complicated bug tracker with 30

00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,460
different forms you have to fill out and

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,500
check and and ok and then you go tell

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,120
new users oh yeah you can contribute go

00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,700
find some bugs in report them in the bug

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,490
tracker yeah you have to know exactly

00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,590
which Perl module is responsible for

00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,300
that little doodad because we're going

00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:31,720
to ask that in the bug tracker but go

00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:34,150
ahead and and file some bugs one of my

00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,850
pet peeves on bug forms for external

00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:38,620
facing users is any time it asks me the

00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:41,800
severity because I know they're going to

00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:44,890
ignore it no one's going to I could mark

00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,930
this is world critical number one bla

00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,210
bla bla and if they don't agree it's not

00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,190
going to get worked but I'm going to ask

00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,960
it anyway and then for bonus points

00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:56,490
number the severity is one through eight

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,490
and don't tell anyone what they mean

00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:04,770
yeah exactly if you really like it good

00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:07,390
to make three your top priority

00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:10,990
gender is another area where websites

00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:14,220
can be unknowingly discriminatory I have

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:16,600
some unique perspective on this but my

00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,280
my suggestions are don't collect it if

00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,750
you don't need it just because you're

00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,520
used to asking people who are it doesn't

00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,370
mean you need it most

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,750
time you don't what you usually want is

00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,970
you want to know how to refer to someone

00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:30,670
do i in the u.s. a lot of times do I

00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:34,480
call a ms or mr. that's what you should

00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:37,120
ask not not gender don't assume gender

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,980
is fixed binary or immutable also don't

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,220
assume people don't ever select the

00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,510
wrong gender when they sign up allow

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,170
people to change the gender without

00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:49,720
calling support I'd call out every

00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:52,420
single hotel chain for hotel loyalty

00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,440
cards it is amazing the effort it takes

00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:59,290
to change your gender with a hotel

00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,340
design this this is the last one on the

00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,710
bullet but it might be the most

00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:06,070
important there's been some studies that

00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:07,960
have said men and women typically and

00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,480
it's very culturally dependent so what

00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,280
makes sense for us population is

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,800
different than say Europe and definitely

00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:18,940
different than say South America but

00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:23,500
within there is design preferences by

00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:25,480
men and women in Western Europe and most

00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,750
of North America that design preference

00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:33,240
is men prefer less colors in a design

00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:35,620
women prefer more colors men prefer more

00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,410
for lack of better word structured

00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,630
appearance of the information women

00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,610
appear prefer more of a form and I say

00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,290
prefer but it's more than that because

00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:48,400
they've actually tested people on

00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:50,680
usability and when sites are designed

00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,720
with their usability in mind they are

00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,640
more not only as this preference of

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,850
preference they're actually quicker and

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,860
better at using the site so there's a

00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,230
bias there and it's a particularly

00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:05,650
interesting bias in the technology

00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:09,730
community because what do we what do we

00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:11,410
say what when you go out to I'll use the

00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,030
example Python that as far as I know

00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:16,600
they're not exclusionary ball use them

00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:18,220
as an example it's a fairly monochrome

00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,170
color scheme for their documentation you

00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,240
go out to Microsoft fairly monochrome

00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:26,110
color scheme for their documentation I'm

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,640
just talking color here as I said this

00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,890
was different in different culture so if

00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,210
you're in South South America you

00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:34,010
probably prefer more colors too

00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:35,270
so we've designed all their technical

00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:39,110
documentation with an idea of

00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:42,860
professionalism that is for essentially

00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:44,000
white Western educated men so that's

00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:55,250
something to think about when you look

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:58,220
around at sites yeah more of a flow or

00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:01,190
more more pictures for instance more

00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:05,450
more visual and this is a stereotype

00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:07,310
obviously it can be misused but in the

00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:19,640
usability study say there is there is

00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:21,380
some basis to this write in it but it's

00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,320
there's also there's also a cultural

00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:27,200
thing because as I said South South

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:30,140
America they also prefer the more colors

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,960
it's just it just so happens that the

00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:35,360
dominant in professional circles the

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,190
dominant culture sets the design and

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,640
that that's all we have so it's

00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:42,290
something to keep in mind I give an

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,260
example here of a site that did it right

00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:46,490
this is meetup they let you change

00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,870
everything you don't have to file a

00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,950
support ticket you don't have to call

00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:53,690
them you don't have to mail them

00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:56,300
anything that's also gender name address

00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,670
all of that can be changed that's the

00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,290
right way to do it

00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:02,030
here's wrong way to do it

00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:03,350
this was my local public health

00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:06,530
department trying to figure out

00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,640
attitudes on substance abuse and they're

00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:11,120
trying to find out is there certain

00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:13,610
groups of people we should target to

00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,770
work with on substance abuse on actual

00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:19,640
public health issue well one of these

00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:21,830
things is not like the others they're

00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:24,620
asking essentially gender transgender is

00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:25,970
not a gender they really want to ask two

00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,010
questions they probably do want to know

00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:30,580
is there a substance abuse issue in the

00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,580
transgender community

00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:35,870
well transgender woman and what she go

00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:37,190
and check maybe she'll check female

00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:39,710
maybe she'll check transgender maybe

00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,750
she'll check I don't wouldn't pick

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,460
either of these it's not getting the

00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,490
information you're wanting so asking two

00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,490
questions

00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:52,529
there's that Facebook for my showed also

00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:54,119
had only male and female I don't know

00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:57,059
how this person would register this is

00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:00,750
this person's actual passport Pakistan

00:34:57,059 --> 00:35:02,250
issues annex for gender for some people

00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:05,819
they're not the only country that does

00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:08,029
it America some states do it some

00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:12,089
European nations do it Australia does it

00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:13,410
so check your assumptions I don't don't

00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:23,759
make this person into something that

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:25,980
they're not know this is an example of

00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:27,329
something that we've had our community

00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,640
and I'm not going to go into it I'm not

00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:31,710
going to talk too much about but Ana

00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,039
logo can be designed to be appealing to

00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:38,369
seven year old girls avoid the trap of

00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:42,230
associating professional with what is

00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:42,230
preferred by Western educated men

00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:49,529
numbers and dates are another area where

00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:53,339
which is really tricky anyone that's

00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:56,779
dealt with dates knows this America we

00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:59,640
have a very acute way of writing dates

00:35:56,779 --> 00:36:02,099
very unique but the rest of the world

00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,900
does doesn't do it that way and those

00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:10,170
aren't the only two combinations by any

00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:12,390
means absolutely in some cases numbers

00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,819
too aren't always written the same way I

00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:18,539
give I don't know if that third one's

00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:22,170
actually correct but there's different

00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:23,700
ways of writing numbers different people

00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:26,190
are going to expect them differently

00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,319
it's not just dot or comma it's more

00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:36,269
than that that second example 1 comma 0

00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:37,829
0 comma 0 0 0 that's typical in India if

00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:41,430
you don't care this is the great thing

00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:42,900
this is something you can take back to

00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,480
your co-workers that don't want to go to

00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,329
a community track so I talked because

00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,640
there's no technical information that

00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:52,440
code almost certainly does not do what

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,029
people expect it to do most of the time

00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,380
if you know Unicode you know what it

00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:57,150
does and you know it's going to print

00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,160
that output and it's going to match

00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:02,520
because those are all valid digits

00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,790
they're all unicode digits chances are

00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:10,620
that's not what you meant

00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:13,290
and I'll tell you how to how to deal

00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:15,120
with that I mean it does exactly what it

00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,130
says it's going to do it that backslash

00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:21,060
D is the character class of characters

00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:22,590
that are digits if you really mean ASCII

00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,080
digits that your database is going to

00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:27,180
understand is a number then you might

00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,310
want to look at the Pearl Ari page I put

00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:33,480
that first sentence just because I I

00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:35,430
love that sentence the slash D / u + / L

00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,340
modifiers are not likely to be of much

00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:41,010
use to you awesome

00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:43,560
the second entry though the slash a

00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,960
basically says be somewhat Unicode aware

00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:51,270
but do not apply the character classes

00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:55,020
to non ASCII characters in general now

00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:58,410
I'm guilty too I've taken over

00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:01,260
maintenance on this I fix this today

00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:06,600
because that IP address parsed it

00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:08,550
probably shouldn't so how many people

00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,620
have some kind of validation going on in

00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:14,940
their website or something that uses a

00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:17,100
backslash D go go check it you can paste

00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,570
unicode in a browser yeah if your web

00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,760
framework or whatever tool you're using

00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:24,770
is Unicode aware then yeah if you're

00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:33,210
validating to make sure a number is a

00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:34,740
western-style digit be careful so some

00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:38,160
other perl modules writing to numbers

00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:41,580
and dates date-time format cldr there's

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,260
others the cldr is the unicode common

00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:46,130
locale data registry

00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,810
everyone knows unicode has a lot of

00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:52,050
smiley faces and pile of poo and all

00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:54,630
those things but it also has a database

00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:56,670
of how different locales do different

00:38:54,630 --> 00:39:01,020
things and that's the common locale data

00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:03,150
registry and so date-time format cldr

00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:07,250
interface with that for dates now give

00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:11,610
an example and numbers using cldr number

00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:12,830
getting a decimal form for a matter in

00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:15,230
this case locale

00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:16,820
and us for the first one and formatting

00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,620
it displays it like you would expect in

00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:22,520
the u.s. through the same thing with

00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:29,330
English India and it displays it in in a

00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:31,960
format that you'd expect their names are

00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:34,670
another area that can be interesting

00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:39,320
names are a lot more complicated than

00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:42,950
just about anyone appreciates first name

00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:45,380
and last name don't refer to your your

00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:49,640
familiar name and your family name they

00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:51,080
are first name and last name nothing

00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,370
more you can't read any more into that

00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,870
because depending on the culture and

00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:55,840
where that person got their name

00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:59,270
determines what what those names mean

00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:01,580
some cultures put family name first some

00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:03,650
cultures don't put a family name an

00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:07,040
example that would be the second example

00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:09,230
which is Iceland if you see a GU nurse

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,150
do tur and I'm sure I'm saying that

00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:15,950
wrong but that's literally mooners

00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:20,480
daughter so you know it's a woman and

00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:23,180
you know dad was Gunnar because in in

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,660
Iceland the names are all gendered and

00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:28,730
that's that's a male gender name you

00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:31,760
wouldn't refer to her as MS Gunnar's

00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:33,500
Deuter that's not that's just not the

00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,650
way they do it they just refer to her by

00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:40,310
our name her usually what we would call

00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:41,780
her first name if your sight if you

00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,280
don't have a good reason to need a legal

00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:47,840
name don't require a legal name allowed

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,520
nicknames and such allow Bob to not have

00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:55,100
to enter Robert it refer it be referred

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:59,210
to as Robert part of that is explain why

00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:01,250
you need a name when you need a name if

00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:03,170
I'm going by a nickname do I put my

00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,850
nickname in here or is it gonna be like

00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,470
the TSA where if I put a nickname I'm

00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:08,450
not going get on that plane because it

00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:10,400
doesn't match my ID so tell me what it

00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,590
meet what it needs to be if it needs to

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,880
be my legal name tell me that but make

00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,970
sure it really does need to be the legal

00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:19,490
name middle name middle initial that's a

00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,860
very culturally dependent thing that's

00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:24,560
mostly an American thing most of the

00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,970
rest of world doesn't do that they would

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,690
either use the whole middle name or not

00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:30,180
at all

00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:31,770
don't assume people have two names don't

00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:35,160
assume they have three either that's

00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:37,050
almost as bad people can have pretty

00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,500
much any number of names depending on

00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:42,690
where they are I ran into this I ran a

00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,820
state government system for a state

00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:47,250
government and we had a couple people

00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,950
with one name we have to handle it we

00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:52,650
were state government so make sure

00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:54,210
you're including everyone so generally

00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:58,430
if you have a first name black and a

00:41:54,210 --> 00:42:05,610
last name blank that's probably wrong

00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:07,500
character link can be huge yeah and then

00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:09,540
don't use names to link databases

00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,220
because names are not immutable there's

00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,680
lots of people that change your name in

00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:15,480
in America approximately half the

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:22,800
population changes their name once in

00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:23,910
their life at least this picture is it's

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,290
kind of interesting too because I can

00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:26,580
tell when there's no men on earn and

00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:29,040
there is only men on the development

00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:31,140
team but this picture on the left that's

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,619
Ellis Island that was a way station for

00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:36,960
immigration to America little over a

00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:39,770
hundred years ago they were kind of

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,540
famous for people would come in with a

00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:45,030
non-english name they would look at it

00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:47,369
and not take much time take about two

00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:49,770
seconds and say okay we're just going to

00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:51,030
lob that last half of your last name off

00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:54,450
we're going to change your first name

00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:56,820
because it's convenient for me a lot of

00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:59,340
websites do that some other things with

00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,930
names allow you're allow posture fees

00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:03,119
hyphens and spaces these are all valid

00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:05,490
characters within a name even within say

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,320
a family name or a given name they're

00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:10,350
all valid characters mr. O'Malley is a

00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:14,580
good example allow accent marks he's

00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:17,340
Jose not Jose so let him be Jose and

00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:20,100
then John Smith senior and John Smith

00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,570
jr. might both use your system and if

00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,430
you want to get billed from them when

00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:27,630
you send your collection notice you'll

00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:29,010
want to have the right one here's some

00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:32,640
bad Perl code there's two different

00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:35,580
snippets here they're both bad the first

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,020
one don't do that it doesn't it doesn't

00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:38,670
do what you think you'll do names are

00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,150
not people don't just have two names and

00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:43,210
once again people can

00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:48,130
have spaces within a type of name with

00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:50,920
for instance a family name the second

00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:53,740
example once again backslash W matches

00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,440
any word character not a through Z like

00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:58,180
the error message here would assume but

00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,859
once again you can have spaces and other

00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:05,109
characters that aren't considered word

00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:07,329
characters in a name make it easy for

00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:11,020
people get married this is my name

00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:12,640
change document different different

00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,170
situations people are going to have

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,670
different documents changing their names

00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:18,039
so be careful what you require for

00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:19,660
documentation I can produce a court

00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:21,549
order other people produce a marriage

00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,140
license other people might change it

00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:24,760
just through common usage that's

00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:27,490
actually a valid way of changing your

00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,279
name in some places including some

00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:34,420
places in the US and it is legally

00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:36,750
binding names they don't stay the same

00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:40,089
for life people get married as I said

00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:41,140
usernames change and so a lot of sites

00:44:40,089 --> 00:44:43,059
will let you change your name but they

00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:45,250
won't let you change your username well

00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:49,770
J doe marries mr. Smith and becomes J

00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:52,390
Smith she can either log in as J doe or

00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,920
get the username changed so provide a

00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:57,279
way to change usernames you might not

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,480
think people need to do it but you're

00:44:57,279 --> 00:45:00,849
going to come into situations where

00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,500
people want to do it if you store

00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:05,950
multiple names addresses this the eBay

00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:07,359
example once again if someone changes

00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,680
their name in one place there's a good

00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:12,819
chance that one change it everywhere so

00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:14,260
at least make that easy for them and the

00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:15,760
first point I brought up was don't

00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,109
require people have a specific document

00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,250
everyone's going to have a little bit

00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:22,480
different document depending on where

00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:25,150
they did this this is from git lab the

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,130
open-source version I changed my

00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:30,970
username my old username was on the

00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:32,859
right there it linked to the corporate

00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:34,839
directory via username so after I

00:45:32,859 --> 00:45:38,079
changed my username I couldn't get to

00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:39,819
get lab in fact I could log in and I

00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,829
could see this I could see this other

00:45:39,819 --> 00:45:43,779
account sitting out there so I had two

00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:47,200
accounts now one had no access to any of

00:45:43,779 --> 00:45:50,380
my projects the other was blocked which

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,750
also was not a very useful debugging aid

00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,130
why was it blocked well it was blocked

00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,950
as his plane to a non exists

00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,750
user name and that was apparently

00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:03,460
non-trivial to fix it took about a week

00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:04,569
for someone fix that addresses I've

00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,450
talked about that before

00:46:04,569 --> 00:46:10,000
phone numbers again allow out a country

00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:12,640
phone numbers people travel not everyone

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,930
has cell phones not everyone has cell

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,430
phone coverage so if you're going to

00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:18,150
require a second factor of

00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:20,740
authentication think that went through

00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:24,009
if you're going to do an SMS message it

00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:26,200
may not work and then let the computer

00:46:24,009 --> 00:46:27,700
help format the number that's just a

00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,380
frustration of mine when I type in

00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,059
something it says oh yeah we didn't tell

00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,849
you to not put dashes in but don't put

00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:35,220
dashes in Thanks

00:46:32,849 --> 00:46:38,559
this is a map of the state of Wyoming

00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:43,269
100,000 square miles 450,000 square

00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:46,329
kilometers the colors are which local

00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:48,519
telephone company services that area the

00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:52,569
white is there is no local telephone

00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:55,589
service that's the cell phone map for

00:46:52,569 --> 00:46:57,759
the cup carrier with the best coverage

00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:59,230
everyone here knows that if the carrier

00:46:57,759 --> 00:47:03,039
says you've got coverage you absolutely

00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:04,720
have four bars right National Radio

00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:07,059
quiet zone so think about this when

00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,190
you're designing your to factor off most

00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:12,940
of the people in that square good chunk

00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:15,640
of West Virginia's Virginia and just a

00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:20,619
teeny bit of Maryland can't use cell

00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:22,769
phones by by federal law so no those

00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:25,150
cell phone towers they won't work anyway

00:47:22,769 --> 00:47:29,440
so if you're going to SMS them how are

00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:32,250
they going to get that think about how

00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:36,670
you're using language on your

00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:38,410
applications this was actually I some

00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:40,319
would translate it but think about the

00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:42,460
other way this is someone that

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,750
considered themselves able to translate

00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,700
they probably consider themselves able

00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:47,950
to to speak that language make sure when

00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,349
you're writing your text someone that

00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:51,789
isn't a native speaker kin can read and

00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:54,869
what they're saying is they're saying

00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:58,359
the credit card machine doesn't work

00:47:54,869 --> 00:48:00,400
another bad example this is Apple in

00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:01,960
their middle of their 56 pages saying if

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,450
you're a government organization and

00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,640
what we're telling you to do is illegal

00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,340
then we aren't going to actually go

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,940
after you

00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:13,010
we don't if on this part of the illegal

00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:14,090
part of the agreement well that's nice

00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:20,900
of them

00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:22,940
not particularly accessible and once

00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,920
again things I've talked about here use

00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:27,410
simple vocabulary and also cultural

00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,510
assumptions that last bullet if I say I

00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:31,030
went to Safeway someone that lives near

00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:32,870
me knows I went to the grocery store

00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,520
someone that's on the other side the

00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:39,170
plant has no idea what the heck of

00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:45,980
Safeway is your profanity filters can be

00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:49,120
a problem so be be careful you'll end up

00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,120
with a cake with three dashes

00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:55,580
so in closing if you want to be

00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:57,560
inclusive what do you do kind of the

00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:59,510
guiding rule is listen to people and

00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,920
respect what they tell you now if they

00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:03,860
tell you you're their name is so-and-so

00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,590
let them tell you that you probably if

00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:09,040
you don't need to validate it legally

00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:11,090
don't I just respect what they tell you

00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,100
consider how universal different

00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:15,200
technology is do people all have cell

00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:17,140
phones do they all have high-speed

00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,360
Internet

00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:24,500
some people are exceptions and don't fit

00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:27,950
into boxes nicely be be willing to

00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:31,190
handle that be aware of that a lot of

00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:33,410
times people will all their friends love

00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:36,020
the site you built and it's great and it

00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:37,700
works great well look outside your group

00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,500
I'll reach out to minority communities

00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:42,410
don't just look for that sample of

00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,880
convenience and finally like everything

00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:45,440
else we do we should respond to failure

00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,230
quickly because we're going to mess up

00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,590
we're going to be not as inclusive as we

00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:52,760
like so

00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:54,590
respond to it quickly but before you

00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:59,990
fire off that quick response to tweeter

00:49:54,590 --> 00:50:01,190
or Twitter tweeter I Twitter I in this

00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:04,040
is the only political thing I'm saying

00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:05,330
do not do what our president does think

00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,330
it through especially if you're coming

00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:11,590
from your company's official Twitter

00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:11,590
