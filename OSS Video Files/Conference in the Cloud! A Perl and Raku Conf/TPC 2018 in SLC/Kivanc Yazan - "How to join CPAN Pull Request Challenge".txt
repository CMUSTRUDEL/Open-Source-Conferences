forward back good good to go hello

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,480
welcome everyone this is Q and thanks a

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,259
lot for coming I'm going to talk about

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,690
CFM per request challenge today and you

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,560
can follow my slides at kiz on our org

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,130
slash slights a little introduction of

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,109
myself

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,230
I studied computer engineering in

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,449
Istanbul Turkey in both University which

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,810
is where I got introduced to Perl for

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,840
the first time then I studied computer

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,329
science in UC Santa Cruz grad school I'm

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,030
working as a software engineer at zip

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,969
recruiter for almost three years now my

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,610
Twitter get help etc name is KY Xia and

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,989
my blog is also K wise in the org these

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,180
days I'm also using another Twitter

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,850
account named pull request club

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,940
especially during this conference I'm

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,430
using it and if you think it has

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,039
something to do with request challenge

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,109
you are absolutely right it has a lot to

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,120
do with request challenge I also speak

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,360
Turkish in Japanese if you speak those

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,860
languages please do say hi and let's

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,720
chat

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:14,850
so my outline is that I will go over

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,200
what cPanel is so this is planned as a

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,540
beginner family talk I will explain why

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,790
Sipan is a great thing but an example I

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,259
will explain what a pull request is we

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,970
don't exempt with another example and

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,979
then I will explain what the challenge

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,960
is what what the CPAP workers challenge

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,060
is then I will try to convince you to

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,970
join the challenge then I will tell you

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,700
how to join a little announcement about

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,340
the future of the challenge and a little

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,100
announcement about birds afetr hackathon

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,090
thing that's gonna happen tomorrow night

00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:50,490
after talks are over so the schedule

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,229
description actually has like has things

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,299
like how to set up your computer or how

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:57,509
does submit your first request but I had

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,670
to take those out for time restrictions

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,590
but if you come to the birds of feder

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,479
tomorrow night I will be more than happy

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,789
to walk you to setup we use or you know

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,170
any anything related to pull requests in

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,180
general if you have any questions just

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,700
feel free to join

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,989
tomorrow I'll come that later anyway

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:22,500
Sipan is the archive of 3rd modules we

00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:26,790
all love and use and it currently hosts

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,889
more than 200,000 third modules which is

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,200
an awesome thing I mean it's a there are

00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:35,359
more than 200,000 modules that do a very

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,040
specific thing so my example will be

00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:40,739
this imagine you're writing a Perl

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,260
script that counts words in a text and

00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:46,139
you you lowercase every single word you

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:51,180
get rid of punctuation etc so that you

00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:54,019
kind of combine similar words in it but

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,950
then you realize you want to merge

00:02:54,019 --> 00:03:00,180
battery with batteries car with cars and

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,340
how do you handle that you have you get

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,980
an idea like you can you can write a

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:09,030
method that takes two words and then

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,219
returns a score to you for how similar

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,810
they are and then you can actually go

00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,609
ahead and write this write this matter

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,799
it works perfectly fine there's nothing

00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:20,159
wrong with it except there already is a

00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,290
module on Sipan that is named stirring

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,209
similarity so instead of writing your

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,840
own you can go find whatever you want on

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:31,349
Sipan and this is true for most of

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,510
things you want to do so Sipan actually

00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:35,430
stops you from reinventing the wheel

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,199
over and over again so that's that's a

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,409
great tool and one of the things we

00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:43,169
don't realize when we use Sipan daily is

00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:46,139
that it's actually a great tool with a

00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:48,900
great community one of the things I

00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,370
really like about Sipan is that you have

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,739
to upload all you don't have to

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,870
technically but you should upload a test

00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,989
to it with your C power module when you

00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:01,709
when you upload a module and there is

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:05,759
this thing called C pen testers that who

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:07,470
are people running your tests against

00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,900
various machines various operating

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,250
systems and various perversions and when

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,759
something fails you get an email from

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,310
Dan saying hey you did your development

00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,289
on Linux but your your script fails on

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,380
Windows so you better figure out what's

00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:24,810
wrong and this is not true this is this

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,360
doesn't exist for every every package

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,750
manager

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,460
there this screenshot is from another

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,430
conference called Linux west-northwest

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:37,990
and John Anderson Jean hack did a great

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:40,000
talk on what Perl does right and he's

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,280
literally saying like please go steal

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,960
this to your language we love this

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,400
feature in Perl so if you haven't seen

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:54,009
it I highly recommend watching this talk

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:56,020
poor request is to oversimplify is how

00:04:54,009 --> 00:05:00,279
open-source community shares called

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:03,069
these days and I will explain it with

00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:07,389
another example so assume I have a purse

00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:10,240
scrap that when run it prints first name

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:12,189
of everyone in this room and it's in my

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,500
name space its key ones slash name

00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:16,360
printer prints your first it prints the

00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:21,310
first name works perfectly fine no

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:24,069
problem you need a similar script but

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:27,069
you need it to print full names not

00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:28,539
first names so you can actually go ahead

00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:31,629
and write it from scratch which is

00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:33,449
perfectly fine but you make a search and

00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:37,060
you come up you come across my module

00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:40,750
and then you decide that you can

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,300
actually take it make the modification

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,909
and then use it instead so that's what

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,969
you do you take my module you copy it

00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:52,150
under your namespace it's still called

00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:54,129
name printer and then you make the

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,839
change so it prints full names instead

00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,939
of first names this is perfectly fine

00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,189
you're you're pretty much done you have

00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:03,759
your script now you can go home except

00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:07,479
you realize the way I split first name

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,339
and last name is happening by looking at

00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:12,520
the first space character in the full

00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:15,370
name and you think to yourself well this

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,169
doesn't seem right he's assuming there's

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,240
a there's no space and first name and

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,639
then you come back to me and say hey you

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,949
know what your script is wrong you

00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:28,689
should probably print full names instead

00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:31,089
and then that thing you say please pull

00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:34,839
this please pull these changes back to

00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:37,270
your original code that is April request

00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,490
and when I merged back it's merged

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,680
you're a contributor to the original

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,410
repository that's a very high level of

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,910
things that's that's very introductory

00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,830
actually behind the scenes what's

00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:51,520
happening is you're just submitting me I

00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:55,750
live file it's just a patch that is that

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,060
is applied to the repository and what

00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,800
happens on github I'm giving an example

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:04,060
on github because pre requests challenge

00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:08,050
highly depends on github it adds a

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,510
conversation to that zip file so there's

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,900
the changes that is made and there's a

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:18,280
discussion that's happening between

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:21,100
maintainer x' and collaborators the

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,590
challenge the Sipapu cos challenge it's

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,260
actually quite simple to explain what's

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:31,510
happening is this you get an assignment

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:33,520
of a CIPA module once a month and then

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:36,550
you are expected to submit at least one

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,370
to request to that module so you get a

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,040
module once a month and now you submit a

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:45,100
request that's pretty much it

00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:48,340
Neal Bowers who is organizing this

00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:51,520
challenge since 2015 he sends you an

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:53,950
email at the beginning of each month

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,990
saying hey this is your assignment for

00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,970
this month here's the link to get up

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,130
here's some test failures here's some

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,440
warnings so you can go work on those and

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,250
then when you are done with your with

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,620
your assignment you actually go and

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:11,500
email him back and say hey I'm done for

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,180
this month is my poor requests and then

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,490
you can also say like I want to get

00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,810
another module next month or I don't

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,210
want to get an ID your get another

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,980
module next month I want to skip or you

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,150
can also say things like I want to quit

00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,340
I don't want to do it anymore

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,950
for whatever reason so what I'm trying

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,200
to say is it's not like once you joint

00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:33,850
you can't get out it's it's very

00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,750
flexible so that's not it's not like a

00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:39,550
school assignment

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:41,350
in that sense there's an outer challenge

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:45,190
I briefly want to mention it's called

00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:46,030
hakdo brofist this is organized by

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,350
digitalocean

00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,810
and github

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:52,090
and the way the way it works is they

00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:54,790
expect you to submit for pull requests

00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:57,280
to any repository it doesn't have to be

00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:59,800
one repository to any repository on

00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,020
github during the month of October so

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,400
the reason I'm mentioning this there are

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,440
a lot of challenges actually happening

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,110
around github the reason I'm mentioning

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,850
this is it's really easy to combine with

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,250
sheep and pukas challenge right because

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,440
if you get an October assignment from

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,230
Neil and then if you submit for pull

00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,860
requests to that cpap module anyway the

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,750
free t-shirt like this real easy why you

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,510
should join besides the free t-shirt is

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,250
that you got to learn a lot about open

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:30,790
source you got to meet a lot of great

00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:34,090
people that spend a lot of time for open

00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:37,360
source and you actually get to

00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:43,210
experience you actually get to learn by

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:45,880
experiencing that pull request you can

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:49,600
read as much as you want I'm not saying

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,910
don't read read and then go explore do

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:57,670
some work submit some pull requests

00:09:51,910 --> 00:10:00,280
hexam modules find some bugs etc you

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:08,080
also improve your communication skills

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:09,760
which is you you need to talk to authors

00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,940
and maintainer of CIPA module that

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,840
you're you're hacking with you need to

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:19,840
see if anyone else has forked the module

00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,210
you're you're working on and if they've

00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,820
worked on it previously so you need to

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:29,920
get in touch with all those people via

00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:31,450
email by Twitter or IRC so that's good

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,770
improving your purse skills it goes

00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,340
without saying you're working on four

00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:38,440
modules you're seeing you're reading

00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:42,010
Perl code that is already used in

00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,570
production for years now and you can do

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,580
it without joining challenge actually

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:49,240
but doing the challenge makes it more

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:51,340
fun this is a slightly less important

00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,720
perhaps you get to learn about new

00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,750
modules that you haven't heard before

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,840
and team building I ended this space

00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,170
specifically because we had zip

00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,639
recruiter actually

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,139
are getting a team assignment as well

00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:05,990
that's something else you can do you can

00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:08,389
join the challenge personally we can

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,649
join the challenge as a group and when

00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:11,360
you join the challenge as a group you

00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:14,540
usually get a bigger module with a lot

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,279
of more issues and when that happens you

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,800
get together with your team and work on

00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:23,060
a module collectively and that's that's

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,430
a lot of fun so that's my try to

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,529
convince you to join the challenge how

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,750
to join is even simpler you just need to

00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:31,220
email neil saying hey i want to join the

00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,519
challenge and then make sure to include

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,620
your get up username if you have a pose

00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:40,190
ID include that as well but that's

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:44,480
optional just get up username is usually

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:48,199
enough the future of the challenge i

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,459
want to talk about this because neil at

00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:51,860
the beginning of this year announced

00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:54,949
that this will be the last year of CM

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,620
pukas challenge so yet another reason to

00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:59,899
join the challenge if you may but he's

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,570
running it since 2015 so it'll be like

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:08,600
four years of request challenge which is

00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:10,640
amazing but it's it's gonna end this

00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,320
year at the end of this year so i

00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,620
started building this new thing called

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,199
pull request club and it's going to be

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:21,230
pretty similar to what pookas challenge

00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:24,560
is it still work in progress but i'm

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:27,769
hoping to have a product by december so

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,560
that it can kind of success it can be a

00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:32,930
successor to the request challenge it's

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,360
going on this will also be open source

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:41,019
so if you want to help me build this I

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,019
really appreciate your help

00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:48,949
the last announcement I have is there is

00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:52,399
gonna be a hackathon /bf tomorrow night

00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:55,699
at 7 p.m. in room arizona and i will be

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,190
there working on my assignment if you

00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:59,360
are joining the challenge if you join

00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,620
the challenge and if you have a

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,319
reassignment if you want to work on it

00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:06,079
feel free to come if you want to work on

00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:09,529
just some random CIPA module or

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,149
something else feel free to join us if

00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:12,930
you have never done a pool request

00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:18,710
before please join us

00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:20,700
be more than happy to help you and

00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,130
thanks for thanks a lot for coming

00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,660
listening thanks thanks a lot - Neil

00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:28,200
Boris who is organizing the challenge

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:32,130
thanks a lot to all attendees of all

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:34,830
participants of request challenge and

00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:37,290
thanks a lot for these photographers who

00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:47,399
made their photos publicly freely

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:52,320
available on unsplash thank you if you

00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:54,480
have any questions he has some extra

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,589
slight looking show so these are the

00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,740
numbers of attendees over the year over

00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:06,120
the years actually started very high and

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:08,570
had a plateau the takes at January is

00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:14,220
kind of nice

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:16,830
there is a calculation behind how CPAP

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,110
modules get assigned so you heard about

00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:21,450
the CPI River yesterday

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:25,230
Neil actually he's using CPI remember

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:28,140
here as well if if a CPAP module has a

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:31,140
lot of sea power moon so that depend on

00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,850
it and it has test failures obviously

00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:37,440
this is something better get fixed soon

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:39,690
so that I guess high priority he

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,690
actually suggested that we should switch

00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:45,750
from assigning modules to assigning

00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:49,830
issues so that it's actually it's a

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:54,170
little easier to get started but we'll

00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:56,610
see how that goes and with the recent

00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:59,190
github being acquired by Microsoft I did

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,720
a little poll and it seemed like some

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:04,279
people wanted to move to get up some

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:08,810
people are not sure what to do but it's

00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:12,360
yeah anyway these are my extra slides

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:19,920
any questions just let me know

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:22,890
I think they are scared that they will

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,040
eventually have to create a Microsoft

00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:28,820
account to access their code but I'm not

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:32,160
really sure it's it might be that it's

00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:34,589
belongs to big corporate now they might

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,890
not feel easy is there anyone who wants

00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:40,459
to comment on why you should run away

00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,459
from get up

00:15:49,640 --> 00:16:19,700
oh yeah next one gitlab gives you free

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,720
private repos at the moment but get up

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:31,670
he's not doing that anymore so that if

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:33,700
that's a deal-breaker all right thanks a

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,700
lot

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,190
you

00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:45,519
