I thought I'd give just a couple things

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,540
on how to open up your open source

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:11,280
modules I'm Joelle Maslak I've got my

00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,019
slide Bentley here but you can probably

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,789
get it in the notes or whatever we send

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:19,410
out if you're making a module you might

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,390
have some questions how do you get

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,550
people to contribute well put yourself

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,930
in the shoes of the contributor so the

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,970
first question someone that might want

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,119
to contribute would have is how do I

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,470
contribute what can't what what do I do

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,770
to do this create a file named

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,480
contributing in your distro i met a

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,629
Sipan will see it they'll even link to

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,969
it on the left side list how the how

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,969
they can find things to do list if you

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,140
have special rules you want to follow

00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,899
examples of special rules don't break

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,980
old stuff talk to me on the big stuff

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:55,500
I've encouraged encourage non-functional

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,739
contributions like if the docs aren't

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,930
clear help help me bug reports Doc's

00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:03,390
anything along those lines meta stuff is

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,220
stuff like disdain ease and idiomatic

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,460
usage that someone else might know and

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,220
you might not a second question they'll

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,049
have is well what a little bit you can

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,150
play in that contributor but put a to-do

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,790
there to and list some things of various

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,420
different skill levels low-hanging fruit

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,340
and more complicated stuff third

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,680
question or third thing they might ask

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,650
is am I actually included this is where

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,390
your code of conduct goes there's module

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,000
just got released last night for your

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,290
just any if you're using just Zilla that

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,720
you can just put one line and you're

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,790
just any and it'll put the contributor

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,790
covenant which is a good starting point

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,420
there's also some other questions people

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,890
may have and this comes in a little

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,450
later when you're trying to give people

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:54,450
credit people do change their names they

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,549
also mess up when they check in stuff so

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,540
if you want to have your git history be

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:03,689
correct use a mail map dot mail map in

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,600
your district tree get will interface

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,459
with this and it will understand how to

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,770
translate your old email address to your

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,940
new email address

00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:15,530
your old name to your new name and I

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,430
give some examples here but you can look

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:21,770
at that up in in the docs as well then

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,510
your get config this is for people this

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,190
is for everyone you don't have this in

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,930
your git config go add it to your git

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,660
config what this does it says when you

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:34,580
do a git log respect to dot mail Maps if

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,900
there there and then finally why you

00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,220
want to have the mail map in the first

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,690
place is to give your contributors

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,930
credit so that they have a reason to

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:45,110
contribute there's a plug-in for that

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:49,010
that adds it to the meta JSON file or

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,520
not emit a JSON file it uses the mail

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,300
map

00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,440
I read your git history and put your

00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,440
contributors in there and I'd give a

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,000
couple examples of options I usually

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,670
provide I usually include the author's

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,370
in there in order by commits you'll see

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,130
on meta Sipan on the right side it'll

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,450
show the author but it also show in five

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,020
contributors and when you click show

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:14,180
them it'll give your contributors credit

00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,130
so in summary these are things you

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,530
should basically do in every module you

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,600
you put out there create at least these

00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,930
three files contributing to do and code

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,970
of conduct so that people know how to

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,320
contribute what you want them to do and

00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:32,450
how to act let people change their names

00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,580
so that's the dot mail map also I told

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:37,040
you what to do in your dot git config in

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,020
your home directory and then how to give

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,709
them credit there's also some other

00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,470
modules sell throw it into your pod

00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:47,630
weaver docks if you're using pod weaver

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,210
slides are out there at that URL i'm

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,319
done early

00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,319
