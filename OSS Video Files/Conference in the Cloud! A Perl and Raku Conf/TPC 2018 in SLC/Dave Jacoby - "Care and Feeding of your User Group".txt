hi and welcome to a care and feeding of

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,899
your user group I'm David Jacoby I'm

00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:18,420
organizer of this event in this and

00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:24,680
organizer also for Purdue pearl hackers

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:27,330
a a user group in Semyon Indiana and

00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,420
I'll let the rest of this panel

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,309
introduce themselves

00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,420
I'm Doug Bell I'm the organizer of the

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:35,420
Chicago Pro markers

00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,870
my name is Johnny Anderson I'm from

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,420
Salem Oregon where I help run a

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:49,620
non-denominational nerd meetup called

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:51,329
hack Salem hi I'm David Adler I'm the

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,079
ruthless godless dictator of the New

00:00:51,329 --> 00:01:04,350
York for all mongers I like their

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:06,659
made-up names and the new the first

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:11,549
point you know when I thought through

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:14,909
this thing was kind of why user groups

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:18,930
what makes them important you know for

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:22,049
you to spend time organizing them and

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:26,549
you know organizing your community what

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:32,060
would what brings that involved my

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:36,140
thought I mean they're like I think four

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:42,290
basic things and they get down to jobs

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:47,430
friendships and technical questions and

00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:49,920
that really amongst our group you know

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:54,840
there's not one technology to call us so

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,710
it comes to the more social aspects of

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,100
that and for us we don't have strong

00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:04,530
connections with any one employer and

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,140
none of us have the ability to hire so

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:11,520
the yo hey let's find a job through this

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,620
doesn't work as much for us as it does I

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,150
think it does for other

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:21,860
oops and he wouldn't want to take that

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:25,319
[Music]

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,870
so I can say that I ended up starting

00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,599
hack Salem which was originally called

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:34,290
the Salem Oregon dynamic language users

00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,290
group which is a horrible damned name it

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:41,299
seemed like a good idea at the time I

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:44,760
moved to Salem six years ago this August

00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:46,019
from the DC area and I had had a couple

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,790
of different meetups that I went to in

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,250
the DC area including the DC pearl

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:54,030
mongers and so I had sort of an expected

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:57,329
monthly level of nerd interaction which

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,459
is something that I enjoy having and I

00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:03,319
got to Salem and I could not find any

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:06,870
technical community whatsoever because

00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:09,030
we're sort of unique in that or unusual

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,090
in that I think unlike Chicago unlike

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,160
New York Portland is an hour away I

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,319
could go to a different meet up in

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,440
Portland every night of the week right

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,120
but the unofficial motto we don't have

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,920
any children in here the unofficial

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,049
motto of HAC Salem is driving to

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:30,150
Portland because it's just annoying

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,769
so I wanted some sort of local technical

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,200
community I couldn't find it

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:38,220
so I just went on meetup.com creating an

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,670
account and made it and originally with

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,650
sort of not you know realizing there's

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,470
probably like one other guy or one other

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,359
person in Salem who does pearl I can't

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,299
just call it Salem pro mongers that's

00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:52,829
not gonna work so I was trying to cast a

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,870
wider net with the dynamic language

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:56,130
thing but it turns out something I've

00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,810
learned over the past couple of years

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,359
I've been doing a lot of conference

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,430
speaking at smaller more regional more

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:04,230
generic technical conferences there's a

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,720
whole lot of dotnet developers out there

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,459
it's it's like there's you know there

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,010
the 80% of the iceberg there are these

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,620
people who work in insurance companies

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,049
and just nine to fivers and doing dotnet

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:20,789
it's it's kind of replaced Java for that

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:22,590
so we intentionally made it even more

00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:24,510
white because about half the talks we

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,430
were getting proposed were dotnet talks

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,080
which is fine

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:34,229
actually doing a dotnet talk here

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:37,050
tomorrow right but the the I guess the

00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:39,270
it was mostly about the socialness and

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,120
then the networking aspects I think fall

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,460
out of that the job-related stuff but

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,500
it's just useful to have you know local

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,699
community people around you who are

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,280
interested in the stuff you're

00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:54,930
interested in so if you can't find it

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:58,289
make it yeah I would say that because

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,599
like I do live in Chicago like there are

00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:03,479
a lot of user groups for you know Ruby

00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:08,099
Chicago's a huge Ruby Ruby development

00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:10,500
to town and so like I keep maintaining

00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:14,190
the Perl mongers and I keep like adding

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:17,880
like stuff for us to do mainly just to

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,590
keep a space for Perl in Chicago like we

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,240
do we do accept talks for basically

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,570
anything tangentially related to Perl

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,180
but it's important that it's the Chicago

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,990
pro mongers to say that yes like Perl is

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,990
here by the way

00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:38,039
yeah well the New York pro mongers as

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,830
you may have heard this morning was

00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:43,349
formed at the first Perl conference and

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:45,800
we basically it really was intended

00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:48,150
originally as just simply a social group

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:55,229
over the years we've added technical

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:58,259
talks and it's just we're really there

00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:01,440
for people who are interested in parole

00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:03,900
or or or maybe just hanging out with

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,830
Perl people even though they don't do

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,240
anything with Perl I suppose and just

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:13,860
getting together and talking and

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:17,880
drinking and you know and maybe learning

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:21,620
something but you know there's no sort

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:25,009
of driving force there other than just

00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,009
socializing really

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:48,350
yeah by all means city but not nearly as

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:54,080
large um we have less people show up and

00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:56,030
yeah it's because what do you find

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,140
people actually getting out of these

00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:09,200
meetings and therefore returning doing

00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:12,140
things to make the question is

00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:26,680
concerning you smaller user groups and

00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:26,680
what well that's a good question

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:34,720
[Music]

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:38,330
so just for for reference Salem is a

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,300
150,000 people in the 2010 census in the

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:47,090
actual city it's like 450 in the metro

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:53,060
area we have about 675 members on meetup

00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:56,060
calm we have meetings a track between 20

00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,070
and 30 people there's kind of a hardcore

00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,320
15 that show up every month and then

00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,630
there are people who bounced in and out

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:07,700
we'll have people show up and never come

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:09,890
back but you know unlike kind of the

00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,620
other you know unlike David unlike Doug

00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:15,560
I don't have a pro focus and I'm

00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,850
actually gonna do you know teaser I'm

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,860
gonna do a lightning talk tomorrow

00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,980
that's basically going to advocate for

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,710
not making it about Pearl because I

00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:28,640
think if I think you're better off

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:30,380
casting a wider net because if people

00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,500
are not doing pearl they're not into

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,610
pearl they're just experiencing the the

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,620
sort of outside the community

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:41,400
impression of pearl they're gonna see

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:45,470
pro mongers and go like so one for those

00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:47,670
of you who are at its Yap see Baltimore

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,300
somebody did a lightning talk called

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:54,390
what the is a monger was it okay

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,400
was Asheville so you have that problem

00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,780
right nobody knows what a monger is and

00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,330
two they just see purling or like I

00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,880
don't do pearl I don't want you know

00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:05,190
making it a wider more general technical

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,800
meetup right and we do pack Salem

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,330
usually has two 20 to 30 minute

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,580
technical presentations every month if I

00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:14,490
can round up two people and a place with

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,590
a projector to have it otherwise we have

00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,230
a social meeting at a local watering

00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,960
hole but you get that general technical

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,190
stuff in overtime right because the

00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,350
other thing that will happen if you are

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:27,510
the organizer of these things you end up

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,310
talking a lot right because there'll be

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,440
times when you can't get anybody else to

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:37,160
talk that's when you can slip the pearl

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:40,080
in right a little spoonful of pearl

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,530
wait spoonful of sugar makes the pearl

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,300
go down right so I think that's a better

00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:48,120
you know the sort of the cowbird

00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,950
Cuckoo's egg approach is a better way to

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,120
do it if you're starting from scratch if

00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,830
you're running an established pearl

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,930
mongers group it's kind of a different

00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,300
thing but if you're just trying to start

00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,040
up something fresh make it as generic as

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:07,170
possible particularly if in our smaller

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:10,970
area I'll say our group we I like to say

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:13,890
we established a palace coup on a local

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:17,430
more polygon technical group heck

00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:22,830
Lafayette which is very similar to his

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:26,430
name and and the you we have two social

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,900
meetings a month one on a Sunday where

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:34,470
we have coffee and one on Wednesday

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:38,430
where we have food in here and the the

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:40,530
the pro mongers corner of this is is the

00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,600
one that gives Tia has a technical

00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,730
content once a month because we wanted

00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,850
more than just the social we wanted the

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:52,779
social but we wanted more of that

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:57,880
that part there's one guy who's focuses

00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:57,880
almost entirely on selenium and our and

00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,319
probably couldn't get much beyond hello

00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:06,319
world in Perl proper but you know he

00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:08,930
comes so he talks to technical people

00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:14,720
you know there's another guy he's I

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:19,970
think more you know on the.net side you

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:23,120
know so it is it is much more having you

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:26,060
know the you know the the fellowship

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,589
aspect you know somebody you can you

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,709
know in the earlier version of this joke

00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:32,569
I pulled out a am the talker

00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:36,920
they gave to the groups I pulled out a

00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:39,110
really dorky joke as a you be in the

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,269
talk what starts with a joke then you

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,120
know to make the point that you want

00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,370
somebody you know around you who can get

00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,050
to this kind of dorky joke you know

00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:54,889
that's the kind of person you're trying

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:58,009
to ya have this group for I mean so as

00:11:54,889 --> 00:12:00,709
someone that does exist in a larger city

00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:04,430
we do have some people who do just come

00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:05,990
for the free food which we're you know

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,339
we're lucky to get sponsored for a while

00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:13,100
there I was actually paying that out of

00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:15,589
pocket but but also like I've been

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,199
trying to plug myself into the larger

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:21,290
Chicago community so there's there's

00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:23,120
actually a Chicago tech slack where I'm

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,880
so like I will go to you know other

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,279
development meetups and I will announce

00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,290
you know the the pearl mongers beat ups

00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:33,500
and we get a lot of cross-pollination

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:36,709
that way so like we do we do open you

00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:39,649
know to general like talks and so we'll

00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:41,209
get a lot of people like we had a ruby

00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:43,759
developer give a talk on my sequel

00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:46,069
performance and so like a lot of people

00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,509
came that were never part of the pro

00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:50,300
mongers don't know about pearl don't

00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:52,790
really care about pearl but they still

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,080
they came and they saw the promo mongers

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,540
saw the pearl community

00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,999
[Music]

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,540
and the concept of food and sponsorship

00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:07,179
I'll offer this in just want to throw

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:09,610
our greater group we had a we brought

00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:11,350
some people from github into you know

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,449
give a talk about git and github and

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:17,379
they brought pizza and we filled one of

00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:19,019
the bigger rooms on campus and as soon

00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:23,529
as the pizza was done it was half-full

00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:26,410
so I I don't personally like sponsorship

00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:31,059
and free food as a thing because I don't

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:33,490
know that it promotes the kind of people

00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:37,569
who will contribute to the greater group

00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:40,660
but yeah that's our corner of the world

00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:45,689
I don't know if that's true of more

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,689
general you have anything to say in this

00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:53,319
yes I mean we've never really tried to

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:55,029
grow I have to say I was the pink yeah

00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:59,079
we don't want people people are terrible

00:13:55,029 --> 00:14:00,399
but no but I mean we I just you know I

00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:03,129
took a look at meet up while weird odd

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:06,459
cos you know and how many did you say

00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:10,019
you had six okay you've got more than we

00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:13,029
do and you're in Salem

00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:15,269
it's the dotnet looking for people to

00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:15,269
talk to

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:21,220
[Music]

00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:22,420
oh no no that's the thing is like we've

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:28,299
got like six hundred and thirty nine

00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:31,740
people on meetup to steal ideas that's

00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:33,999
just newer Pro markers yeah yeah yeah

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:38,490
yeah well yeah that's true you've got a

00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:38,490
wider wider range

00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:56,079
is started a December so it is five and

00:14:52,180 --> 00:15:00,430
a half years old bow chew and a half

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:02,350
years ago a local tech recruiter and

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,149
some people who work in the supper

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,220
developer division division of a little

00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:09,990
credit union started a group called the

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,990
eleventh Valley software engineers

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,660
because they didn't look closely at the

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,660
hash table

00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:24,970
it's actually it's so into the State

00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:27,569
Capitol that's really all you need to

00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:30,430
know it's the State Capitol right so

00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:32,439
it's it's not the most exciting place in

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,689
the world but there is a fair amount of

00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:38,589
technology there because it's all the

00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:41,649
state stuff right so I think we're both

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:43,779
getting about the same number of people

00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:48,370
the core groups are partially

00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:52,569
overlapping diagram and they we've got a

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:54,490
different vibe they're kind of a khaki

00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:57,639
and button-downs and we're like the

00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:59,519
open-source hippies right so the top

00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:01,870
topics end up being slightly different

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,220
the audience is it that makes like that

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,629
but the approaches are different because

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,189
one of them the tech recruiter is

00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:08,949
sponsoring again the credit union is

00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:10,480
sponsoring and they do have food we

00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:13,809
never had food like somebody

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,329
spontaneously brought pizza once I will

00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:19,749
usually fill up a growler of beer in

00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:21,490
word at a venue that doesn't mind but

00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:24,040
otherwise I'm too damn lazy

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,720
that's a handle wink like during

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,990
coordination like that sounds like work

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:33,399
right finding sponsors that sounds like

00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:34,990
work so just different I think there's

00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,149
room for a lot of different approaches

00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:39,429
yeah that I think that's true I mean

00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:41,319
that's that's actually my thing is that

00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:44,439
and you know there's like what can you

00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:47,769
do and like it really kind of depends I

00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:50,079
mean it depends on your the people in

00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:51,339
your area like I was gonna say you know

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,649
we've got like six hundred and thirty

00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:57,639
nine people on meetup but at a social

00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:59,470
meeting get like 10 15 people unless

00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,529
like someone's someone's in from out of

00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:06,419
town people will show up

00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:09,150
you know but but and technical meetings

00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:11,819
we get more people and part I think part

00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:15,569
of that is you know sometimes we'll have

00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:18,959
the technical meetings at some business

00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:22,049
that uses Perl and so you'll get not

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,990
only people coming who have heard oh

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:27,480
there's this Technic but people in that

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,460
at that business who will show up and I

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,230
think and I think also you know I I

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:35,610
don't actually have any data to support

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:37,260
this but I think that you know if you do

00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,860
have some kind of event a technical

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:43,110
meeting or something at a local business

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:45,299
you'll get people coming to that from

00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,220
that business and other people who will

00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:49,830
hear about it kind of through the

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,200
grapevine and maybe that'll be something

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:56,220
that'll expose your group to more people

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,500
and that'll help grow things you know

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:03,090
there there are all kinds of different

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:04,860
possibilities of how to find people and

00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,710
you know but it but what it really comes

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,600
down to is do people want to get

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,179
together with other people because some

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,840
people simply don't it's just you know

00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:21,120
and it's it's hard to gauge what the

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:24,690
reality of that is okay that kind of

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:28,860
brings you know to mind you know and

00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:31,409
I'll say this before you if we have any

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,799
specific questions as we go on I'll be

00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:42,030
glad to to you go to that but that goes

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:46,020
into um how do you bring in our welcome

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:50,549
beginners I don't I mean for us it can

00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:53,880
be with with when we were just pearl

00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:55,260
mongers there was one time where we you

00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,470
know there are a couple grad students

00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:01,409
and in biology and biology was a little

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:04,169
bit less now but was very much pearl

00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:06,240
because pearl good worth text and you

00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:11,159
know about you know with you genetics

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,830
that see the atcg yes yes I should know

00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:17,360
this because I work with it

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:20,779
well I work with data that anyway and

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,320
and I I I was actually the presenter and

00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:26,480
sake okay rather than do anything I had

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,490
spent the last week putting together we

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,440
just through an audible and and work

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,850
through some of the questions they have

00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:36,970
and some of the stuff they were working

00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:42,260
with but beyond that of how to welcome

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:46,970
beginners I guess or you can take it so

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:48,230
I like so we I tried likes I had noticed

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:51,890
that our technical talks were kind of

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:54,500
going towards the deeper knowledge and

00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,990
yes we were getting some beginners and

00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,020
so that's when we started having the the

00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:02,000
office hours meetings where like the

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,640
entire nature of the meaning is hey

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,240
don't know anything come here and we'll

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,809
talk like again tangentially related to

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,330
Perl doesn't have to be but go ahead and

00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:15,529
so that's how like that started and we

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,929
had a couple people who show up

00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:23,419
regularly and eventually that turned

00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:26,840
into me mentoring them in a project but

00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:29,779
I guess when when speaking of beginners

00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,429
and or newbies to the to the meetings

00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:36,409
one thing I would recommend against is

00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:38,960
like singling them out like having

00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:41,090
everyone introduce themselves everyone

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:46,460
but one having done this you know a

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:52,070
dozen times before it's awkward so I'll

00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:53,570
actually so we actually start every

00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,970
exhale a meeting by going around the

00:20:53,570 --> 00:21:01,520
room and introducing ourselves and it is

00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:04,039
occasionally awkward I don't think I'm

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,529
going out on the limb it's too far to

00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:08,510
say that you will frequently get members

00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:10,970
of our tribe who are not the most

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,830
socially adjusted showing up at these

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:16,130
meetings and so that that can sometimes

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,600
be you know if you ask somebody to do a

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,789
rapid introduction and they're still

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,889
talking fifteen minutes later you need

00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:24,080
to do some social engineering there but

00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:25,880
it is nice and it provides an

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,360
opportunity like it it gives a little

00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,640
bit of con

00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,440
I think it helps put people a little bit

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,320
more at ease because they get names and

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,620
it's a great time for people to mention

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,890
if they're hiring or looking for work in

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,750
a and I explicitly say that like you

00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,519
know tell us who you are where you work

00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,809
at if you want to you know what you're

00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,269
interested in this is a great time

00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:49,490
mention if you're looking for worker or

00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:52,399
looking to hire right and then just go

00:21:49,490 --> 00:22:10,580
around the room fills up a little bit of

00:21:52,399 --> 00:22:12,080
time helps break people in and the

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,230
question may be something simple like

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:25,549
you know what's your favorite pastry

00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:29,320
thing but it and then you have people

00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:29,320
just doing an open-ended introduction

00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:41,360
and then you get to the other guy who's

00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:43,250
like I have no idea what he's like okay

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,850
so change the dynamic of the meeting

00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:50,590
into into one more collaboration than

00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,590
consumption right you had a question

00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:10,460
pearl seminar in you are going for ten

00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:13,679
of the minutes we had one meeting space

00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:17,639
I would say maybe eight boards they have

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:20,399
a pending ground later the previous at

00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:23,609
that time things so yes there was a

00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:25,169
yahoo that was the mailing list but what

00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:29,489
I would do is I would actually have

00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:33,119
people sign in with email clipboard as

00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:34,859
the beating and then at the intermission

00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:39,119
of the meeting I would go down the

00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:41,099
clipboard and call out everybody at

00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,539
least was recognized but they didn't

00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:59,489
even speak if they did

00:23:42,539 --> 00:24:00,809
right right contrast Sawyer Matt Jensen

00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:14,849
this morning the one time that he

00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:15,389
actually spoke in New York started the

00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:19,469
meeting

00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:20,820
by having everybody of like 35 people go

00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:22,409
around the room and introduce themselves

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,509
where the working tell us something

00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:26,609
about them so well that ate up 45

00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:29,309
minutes of the what was supposed to be a

00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:32,989
two hour meeting Anthony Quinn so late

00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:42,479
that we had to cancel the social aspect

00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:46,440
yeah tell apart right so I caution is is

00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:48,119
the container maybe you know the first

00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,169
time someone does a presentation you

00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,169
have to give a little

00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,390
since you I would say that ask everybody

00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,070
because as soon as you start saying

00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,990
introduce you know introduce yourself

00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:15,300
people don't want to expand it and then

00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:16,800
they'll take a lot of time okay oh you

00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,900
know take that and go over that you you

00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:25,170
mentioned location you know and that

00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:27,720
does bring in you a here lot yeah you

00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:31,430
mentioned the the several meal places

00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:35,490
that that you met and you earlier today

00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:37,920
you know being at Purdue we have it is a

00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,900
large number of rooms with projectors

00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:43,440
that are basically empty after five

00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:46,620
o'clock so you know and a lot of them

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,050
empty during the day so you a finding a

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:54,000
room has never been an issue you know

00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:56,130
with us it you for the first first

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,510
couple years we organize well a good

00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:01,080
chunk of the years we organize as a

00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:03,120
brown bag you lunchtime meeting which is

00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:07,530
great for the people of Purdue to come

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,690
you know in over the lunch time but yeah

00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,580
yeah anybody you know it's like even if

00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,260
you worked in town

00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:16,440
you know that still meant you couldn't

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:22,130
me a park within a mile of where we were

00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:25,350
meeting after that we moved to a local

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:28,950
co-working space and you know that is

00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,550
good and wonderful except the door was

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,260
locked

00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:33,540
you know and so with somebody you know

00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,480
it's like God you know say going up to a

00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:41,220
door and will they let me in or not that

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:44,160
is not as welcoming as as you might want

00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,740
and similarly this was a JavaScript

00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,450
group in Indianapolis that I went to it

00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,940
was in in their room with their

00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,640
conference room and again it's like you

00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,340
have to go through their locked door

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:59,280
even that you're very welcoming a nice

00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:02,250
group once what you got in but it always

00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:05,370
felt like going into somebody's living

00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,559
room it's like if you don't know the

00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,740
person you're not going to feel

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:12,860
comfortable in their living room so

00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:15,529
thoughts of any location time place yeah

00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:19,220
no I like so for the longest time we

00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:22,370
were at a large bank where they did have

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:24,769
like access controls but all I had to do

00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:26,029
was go down to the the front desk say

00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:27,679
here here's a list of people who are

00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:31,279
allowed in and if anybody else comes

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,559
from our Chicago pearl mongers give me a

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,029
call and like let me know and I'll let

00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:38,179
you know whether or not they're on the

00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:41,509
list but we move to this new building

00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:44,539
now I have to physically go down all the

00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:46,249
way down and pick the people up which

00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:47,809
means that if they're not on the list or

00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:50,119
if they're if they're come in late they

00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:52,309
have to call me which means that they

00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:54,080
had to have my phone number and they

00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:55,460
have to have a cell phone because the

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,889
front desk won't allow them to use their

00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,960
phone to call me and I think that has

00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:01,970
actually had a big impact in our

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,710
population as to like people just

00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,539
walking in and saying hey I'm just gonna

00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:08,749
try this out well they get to the front

00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:11,119
desk and they're stopped

00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:12,889
but luckily literally next door is the

00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:14,929
Harold Washington library and I haven't

00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:18,200
gone there but they've got like

00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:19,789
wonderful like open public spaces so I'm

00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:26,029
probably going to have to like check

00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:26,659
that out myself we went to our local

00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:29,419
library

00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:31,340
and and for one meeting the issue there

00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:35,570
was they blocked everything except web

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:38,200
so you know it's like you they you doing

00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:40,879
anymore this is a cool thing I did with

00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,889
you know that you have to get SSH into a

00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:46,580
thing yeah that's just wasn't gonna work

00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:48,679
so we did did that once I actually I

00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,509
actually bought a little like tethering

00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:53,539
device that can support up to 20 people

00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:55,809
because at the bank they would not allow

00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:57,740
anyone on their Wi-Fi at all so I

00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:00,019
thought the bill for a little bit of

00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:02,110
cellular connectivity for that exact

00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:02,110
reason

00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:11,490
like it wasn't actually like I think I

00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:14,280
paid like an extra above my my my bill

00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:19,410
was like another $50 a month and I never

00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:20,100
reached my bad with caps at all so what

00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:25,410
a mensch

00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:27,540
I would so I would say that if you're

00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,950
interested in doing this right if you're

00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,960
interested in starting

00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,970
what are these groups the thing that you

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,940
need to recognize is that the biggest

00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:39,480
single pain in your ass is going to be

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:43,680
finding a place to actually meet I have

00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:47,340
a struggle every month of and and we got

00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:50,040
really lucky that someone who works for

00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:53,430
the local real estate information

00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,560
service who's their head of training not

00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:58,080
technical at all she just says I like

00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:01,260
hanging out with nerdy people she

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,330
generally makes the training space that

00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,030
they have which is like a room set up

00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:08,640
with a projector available to us if

00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:10,770
she's in town she's been doing that for

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,620
like if she hadn't been available

00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:15,780
I wouldn't alas today year because

00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:18,780
finding a place that has a projector

00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:22,580
that people don't want to charge you for

00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:25,140
that's not a 21 and over only venue is

00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:29,270
just such that you don't have to pay for

00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:31,950
right is such a frigging nightmare so

00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:33,900
bear in mind that that is that you know

00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,460
you might think oh I'll have to find

00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,800
people to come or I'll have to find

00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:43,260
people talk that's never an issue like

00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:59,180
just finding a place to have it he just

00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:59,180
agrees with me okay I work for me either

00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:08,630
do you have an internal idea of what

00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:11,060
your meetup is for like what your

00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:22,190
personal goal is for it and have you

00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:24,140
shared that I I don't think I've shared

00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:27,620
it explicitly with the people in our

00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:32,960
group but it is you know it you know it

00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:38,000
is for you know it's like finding the

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,860
local experts as well as you know the

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,790
company you know the the fellowship the

00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,050
comradeship I mean you would say you

00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:47,330
legend has it one of the you know it's

00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:50,780
like the the first definition hacker

00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:54,740
that is the local expert in this you say

00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:57,590
I have a question while s ask gene hack

00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,720
he he hacks Perl are you know that sort

00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:02,120
of thing and so finding the person who

00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:06,710
can answer my question I'm the weird

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:09,740
thing I want to play with you is is the

00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:11,930
one thing ill if I get nothing else if I

00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,880
get that I'll be happy you'll be having

00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:19,460
somebody who can understand it when I

00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:21,770
you say you know gpfs is just destroying

00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,200
my workday today he would say going is

00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:26,990
you know even if they can't help that

00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,720
they even understand why a file system

00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:33,440
failing on me is is the problem yeah

00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,870
then you know it's like understanding

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,550
what my complaints even are even if they

00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:42,290
can't you know that that is the second

00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:44,750
thing yeah but you know net yeah so for

00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:46,520
I guess for me because you know the

00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:50,120
chicago development community is larger

00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:53,120
it's mostly just a base for Perl in that

00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,040
community but also like a space for

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,940
people who like Perl to be part of the

00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:02,390
Chicago development community like so a

00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:03,200
gateway kind of into like hey I know you

00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:06,170
know a bunch of people in the Chicago

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,120
Python users so like if you want to know

00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:10,820
about Python I can you know introduce

00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:13,020
you to these people or I know you know

00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,630
people who know my sequel they don't

00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,940
the per longers meetings but we can

00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:20,040
introduce you kind of thing so just

00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,050
basically is a small part of a greater

00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:27,870
you know kind of general development

00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:29,490
community so don't I don't have a single

00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:32,550
answer to this I have multiple answers

00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:34,350
to this one aspect of it that I have

00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:36,990
sort of shared explicitly with the group

00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:39,030
is it's about learning and information

00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:42,300
exchange right just getting exposed to

00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:44,280
new stuff a second thing is just

00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:48,570
developing a technical community where I

00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:51,780
couldn't find one and and sort of a sub

00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:53,520
aspect of that honestly that I didn't

00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,340
share with the group but I guess I'm

00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,560
sharing here is I started the group like

00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:01,170
I said after I had moved so I moved from

00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,730
DC to Salem I knew nobody other than

00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:05,490
like the members of my immediate family

00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:08,280
and I work from remote I work from home

00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:13,230
right so making friends as a grown up

00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,940
person is hella hard so this was

00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:19,820
basically a way for me to make some

00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:23,850
local friends sounds sort of vaguely

00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:25,649
inefficient like but the other thing

00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:28,080
that I have also been explicit about

00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:31,080
that I need to be more explicit about is

00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:33,630
that I like to think of AK Salem as sort

00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:36,000
of a farm League or a safe space for

00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:38,909
people who haven't done a technical talk

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,649
and want to get into it I need to be

00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:42,960
better about articulating this and about

00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:47,220
articulating the fact that I'm willing

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,990
to give feedback to people but I like

00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:51,360
one of the things I do I have an intro

00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:53,280
deck that I go through at the beginning

00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,350
of every meeting that's kind of like the

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,660
agenda and blah blah blah one of the

00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:00,600
things I have is if there are upcoming

00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:02,550
local tech like tech conferences I tell

00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,850
people when the CFP is open I encourage

00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:07,410
people to submit because it would be

00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:11,060
really nice to go to conferences and not

00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:11,060
sit on panels that are for white dudes

00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:20,670
and so the only way to do that is to get

00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,460
people to talk and the only way to get

00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:24,710
people to feel good about

00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,750
to eat least ease the transition over

00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,400
that initial hump is to give them a safe

00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,609
space where they can do it and so that's

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:41,500
kind of also what I'm trying to do

00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:41,500
explicitly I mean what is our purpose

00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:49,730
yeah basically I mean that's really it I

00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:52,190
mean yeah I mean it literally started I

00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:54,230
mean that was that was our kind of if we

00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,880
had a mission statement it was get

00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:59,089
people away from their computers and in

00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,950
front of other Perl people and it really

00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:02,900
has been I mean that's the thing it's

00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:05,089
like you know it's interesting in the

00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,460
you know John says that you know he did

00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:09,950
this because he you know wanted to make

00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:13,280
friends with people in a new place and

00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:15,200
that's kind of actually how New York

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,960
whoremongers started because literally

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,330
when we all met at the first pro

00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,710
conference Brian had just moved to New

00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:24,770
York and didn't really know that many

00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:28,430
people and he said oh here are pro

00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:31,550
people who live in New York we couldn't

00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:34,099
do stuff and but it's but it and but the

00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:37,609
thing is it's not you know as a social

00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:41,150
group we it's not like we sit around and

00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:44,000
talk about purl exclusively we it's like

00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:46,040
that's just a sort of an entry point for

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,950
people to like okay we have this in

00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,650
common let's hang out and just talk

00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:53,210
about stuff and I've I mean I you know

00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,859
in the pro community generally and

00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,770
through pro mongers I mean I've made

00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:59,990
tons of friends over the years who I'm

00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:02,839
you know I have other interests in

00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:04,700
common with you know I was actually I

00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:06,920
was looking at the the list of people

00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,330
who were the original New York promos I

00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,300
realize I'm still friends with half of

00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:12,800
these people and not because we're all

00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:16,130
pro people and then

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,810
so it's an end but I mean there are but

00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:20,750
there are other things like when we do

00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:22,790
have technical meeting that's when we do

00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:25,099
you know go through periods where we are

00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,510
having a greater technical means like if

00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:28,250
we were currently having regular

00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:31,670
technical meaning I'm sure we would have

00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:33,950
had a thing where we would have offered

00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:35,510
you know if anyone's coming to the pro

00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:40,040
conference and wants to try out their

00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:41,869
talk before coming here you know we

00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,290
would have had a night of people you

00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:47,210
know trying out talks and we're we you

00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:50,410
know and we were having a meeting next

00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:52,490
week for a sort of a post conference

00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:54,619
get-together and there will be people

00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:57,309
there who were here and people who

00:37:54,619 --> 00:38:00,589
weren't here and one here about what

00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:02,480
happened so it's kind of an organic

00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:06,170
thing for us it's like you know there

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,809
are those kind of you know purl related

00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:12,349
things that are advantageous but we

00:38:08,809 --> 00:38:16,790
don't we don't plan them as carefully as

00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:21,230
we could but but they happen and that's

00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:24,260
a and that's a good thing okay

00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:29,720
one thing I'm you know hearing a lot in

00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:32,000
terms of you know yeah you when I hear

00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,400
groups mentioned I hear meetup mention

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,589
and when I see new people I make a point

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,500
of asking so where did he hear about us

00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:44,180
because I you know I do other things I

00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:45,920
have a you a a Twitter group you know

00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:49,220
Twitter account for our group that I

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,440
automate you basically spitting out

00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:54,349
what's coming up on from the meetup onto

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,420
you know onto that in that and then it's

00:38:54,349 --> 00:39:00,950
definite oh I saw it on Meetup you know

00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:04,540
that sort of thing yeah I don't want

00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:08,000
this to be an ad you know for meetup so

00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:10,849
you know and but I'll point out that you

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,420
know several of the meetups and I yeah

00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:18,470
I'm part of the meetup - I probably pad

00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:20,420
out some of these other groups just to

00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:25,280
what what are they doing what are ideas

00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:30,500
I can pull into mine so what other tool

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:33,349
I mean I've tried to do you Google Plus

00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:35,540
as a group because I mean I think the

00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:37,369
average member of a person who

00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:42,890
contributes to Google+ as a programmer

00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:44,630
but you know it just kind of you know

00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:47,000
energy came back so

00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:49,460
you know wasn't a thing but meetup it

00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,870
actually gives most of the stuff that

00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:53,600
you need for a user group

00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:55,780
so what other tools are what else do you

00:39:53,600 --> 00:40:00,320
have to say on I guess attracting people

00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:02,090
to listen to Track outreach I guess as

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:09,980
our my thoughts at this point any

00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:11,690
comments questions me on that marketing

00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:16,970
is not evil but sure feels like it I do

00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:18,200
have to agree with that and I keep

00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,810
saying I don't know that I've ever

00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,420
convinced anybody of anything in my

00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:25,130
whole life which means Yomi iam

00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:28,040
marketing is convincing people to come

00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:36,290
to my user group and I'm not sure yeah I

00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:38,960
have those skills hmm Noah's gay windii

00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:51,700
always gets a this but I mean sort of

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:51,700
the we do I mean we

00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,880
[Music]

00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,659
[Music]

00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:34,520
anything like that yeah person that was

00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:41,980
sponsoring the the meet up stop

00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:41,980
sponsoring it and I'm playing so yeah

00:41:44,020 --> 00:42:02,510
all these people that were being yeah

00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:06,260
yeah a lot of those 675 people that are

00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:11,810
on my group are like Russian whatever

00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:13,490
yeah well a lot of them are you say okay

00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:21,950
well you trying to steal ideas for their

00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:24,140
group as well as a Twitter account for

00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:26,119
the group I've got a I've got a Facebook

00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:29,089
account for the group

00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:32,810
I don't always post to them too because

00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:34,820
again I'm lazy a friend of mine is

00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:36,890
actually working on and I haven't really

00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,140
checked it out so this don't consider

00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:41,810
this more informational than a strong

00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:45,020
endorsement but there is an open source

00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:48,020
attempt to sort of replicate meetup it's

00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:52,790
called get together and you can get that

00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:57,920
at GE tea together all one word doc

00:42:52,790 --> 00:43:00,530
community so that might be if the meetup

00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,730
costs because meetup it does end up

00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:06,589
being like they charge you based on the

00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:08,420
number of people in your group now so if

00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:10,130
you have like more than 200 people they

00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,290
kick you into a higher-priced here and I

00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:14,510
think I'm paying like 90 bucks every six

00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:16,579
months which is not a hardship for me

00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:18,109
but if you're trying to get something

00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:20,270
off the ground it may be the other thing

00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:22,900
you can do like I am technically the

00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:24,829
organizer of the bend pearl mongers

00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,050
because they were trying to get

00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:28,670
something started up and I don't think

00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:31,520
there's an upper limit on the number of

00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:33,619
meetups you can have so if you can find

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,349
somebody who pays for meetup and get

00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:39,440
them to add your group that might be an

00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:42,109
option too because you can delegate

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,630
pretty much everything except asking

00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:45,050
people for money to somebody else like I

00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,150
don't

00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:49,700
that Bend group the the person who runs

00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:53,950
it does everything that needs to be done

00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:58,430
so yeah I do the same thing for another

00:43:53,950 --> 00:44:00,590
meetup group mostly because the way the

00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:02,120
way meetup does succession someone can

00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:04,670
actually like so if you step down as the

00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:07,400
meetup organizer anyone who's a member

00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:09,230
of the meetup can take it and in Chicago

00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,480
there was a like oh there was a rash of

00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:12,770
like random people taking on meetup

00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:17,300
groups and then using them to push

00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:22,310
multi-level marketing schemes so I like

00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:25,460
I I took over to not push multi-level

00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:28,010
marketing schemes the hemos most of most

00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,950
my we we also use meetup to do like all

00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:33,470
of our organization it's it's it's worth

00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:35,510
every dollar I pay for it because

00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:39,440
otherwise I'd have to write it all

00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:45,490
myself or use act which I don't think

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:50,180
those are different so there's also big

00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:52,940
again I'm a member of the the slack you

00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:56,230
community for free Chicago yes so yeah

00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:59,750
there was a there was a couple of like

00:44:56,230 --> 00:45:03,650
open-source advocates who created a

00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:05,360
Chicago tech slack and since slack

00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:08,450
doesn't technically allow you to

00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:10,280
register anonymously for slacks what

00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:13,700
happens is there's a Heroku app out

00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,980
there that you sign into that and then

00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:18,440
it goes like the slack bot that then

00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:22,790
sends the the invitation out so it's

00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:27,200
technically open an open slack kind of

00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:29,930
community and yes and so like I barely

00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,610
advertised my stuff there because

00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:35,830
there's there's like specific channels

00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:35,830
for events and and coordinating all that

00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:45,440
further questions comments

00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:52,070
Hyde remark sir boots have durations to

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:55,700
