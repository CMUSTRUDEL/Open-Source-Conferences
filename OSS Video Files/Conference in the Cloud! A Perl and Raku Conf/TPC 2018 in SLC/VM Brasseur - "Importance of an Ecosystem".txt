Title: VM Brasseur - "Importance of an Ecosystem"
Publication date: 2018-06-19
Playlist: TPC 2018 in SLC
Description: 
	Inspired by the decimation then return of wolves from the Yellowstone ecosystem.

FOSS projects and communities can benefit from recognising that they’re not simply one focal point. Each one is an ecosystem. Ignoring or killing off one part of that system has dramatic (usually negative) impacts on the rest of the system. Sometimes these impacts can lead to extinction.

This keynote may discuss:

- The nature of ecosystems
- Examples of healthy and unhealthy ecosystems, both natural and FOSS
- Implications for P5
- More importantly, implications for P6 as it’s just starting its (hopefully long and productive) life

hello everybody I'm still Dan right and

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:13,799
it's still my job to thank people and we

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,880
have a lot of people to thank and we'll

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,449
be thanking them throughout the

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,850
conference but right now I would like to

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,160
highlight one of our sponsors in

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,789
particular I'd like to talk to you

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,279
briefly about Grant Street group who has

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:33,570
I believe been the longest-running

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:41,460
sponsor that tpf has ever had I can't

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:44,489
remember good Grand Street group these

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,219
guys are awesome okay they they have

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,320
been there for pearl for everything I

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,379
can't remember a conference that they

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,820
didn't sponsor and anytime we need

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,760
something when we're running a

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,620
conference we know that if we just go to

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,750
Grant Street and say hey we're in a bind

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,239
we need this thing can you help us they

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,570
always do and so there's some great guys

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,900
and they do some really cool stuff and I

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:15,330
would like to introduce right now Paul

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:17,100
Tomlinson mr. Tomlinson is a software

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,189
development team leader at Grant Street

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,310
group and he works on the payment

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:25,740
express project there he's he's done

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,250
some great work both at Grant Street

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:32,750
group and companies like Amazon United

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,590
Health Group and endurance and others so

00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,960
Paul is going to come up here and

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,410
introduce our keynote speaker so let's

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,430
hear it for Paul

00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:47,320
[Applause]

00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:49,000
I thought it was a little bit fun that

00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,220
Dan would introduce me so I could come

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,680
up here and introduce Vikki I couldn't

00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,310
find anybody to introduce Dan but we'll

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,280
work on that

00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,990
Shane next time so I'm up here I'm

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,280
trading on grassroots goodwill I've only

00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,700
been with them for about two and a half

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,570
years now Grand Street is we do

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,830
financial processing for government in

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,380
usually related to taxes and whatnot

00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,840
super stable slow moving high focus on

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:17,530
quality and we've been using Perl since

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,050
95 and we've been doing the the

00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:24,310
government software thing for the last

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:27,670
or about 20 years and experiencing a an

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:30,790
annual compound growth rate of 20 20 %

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:33,850
that entire time on average so we're

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,860
really stable we're always hiring and so

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,860
just a note about our relationship with

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,209
Perl is we started with Perl because

00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,890
that's what one of the engineers there

00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:44,080
knew but they kept hiring for it because

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,450
they could build an ecosystem in it Perl

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,010
is not for everybody and it's not

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,900
necessarily for every problem Perl is

00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,450
really good at working with data and

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,220
other more modern languages that have

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,570
come along tend to optimize their

00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,280
concerns a little bit more differently

00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,590
for processing data in this way or

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,900
processing data in that way well Perl

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,160
can be optimized for processing data in

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,920
any of these ways it's kind of a Swiss

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,750
Army chainsaw so it might not be the

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,760
best or the most optimized for one of

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,519
these little niche problems but what we

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,150
found is by being so generalizable well

00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,709
the it works as it you know it it does

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,540
what it does it's good at that but the

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,700
most important part is Perl developers

00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,500
so Perl developers by having a

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,540
generalizable mindset and being able to

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,489
think of more than one way to do these

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,980
things are really good at

00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:33,730
problem-solving so whether or not Perl

00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:35,049
is the best language that's a long

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,530
debate to have with anybody about

00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,290
anything

00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,970
Perl developers tend to be the best

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,530
developers so we hire for that we

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,630
cultivate it we try to participate in

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,519
the community because we love what we

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,709
get out of Perl developers who can solve

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,230
those problems so I've only been there

00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,730
two and a half years that's kind of the

00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,310
average tenure for the company even

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,810
though we keep hiring because we hire

00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,349
people on and they tend to stay for a

00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,019
really

00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:00,219
time so anybody who's there has been

00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,930
there for a while as well entrenched

00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:03,489
tries to participate in the community

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,989
we've got ten people here at the

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,659
conference so you'll be seeing us

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:10,840
running around if we can answer anything

00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:13,420
for you or get your resumes always

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,199
always hiring so that's that's our spiel

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:19,000
there we like purel we love it we're we

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,829
participate in in the community wherever

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,990
we can we released open source and we

00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,419
try to have a supportive culture both in

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,770
and outside of the company so that's

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:28,419
what I get to say because we're

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,610
sponsoring the most important part

00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:32,440
though is Vicky brewer here is going to

00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,479
talk to you about the the importance of

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,639
ecosystem and maintaining the larger

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,810
picture outside of grant Streep because

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,910
we understand that other people use

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,250
pearl as well so if you please welcome

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:46,540
the key to the stage

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:52,630
[Applause]

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:54,100
Oh hi everyone I just want to tell you

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:58,030
upfront this is not an audience

00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,730
participation keynote so get it out of

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,950
your system right now because I don't

00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:06,720

am an open-source policy and strategy

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,950
freelancer I've spent previously a lot

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,450
of time with Perl I'm the former

00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,750

camel award I'm an author and community

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,200
moderator for open source com the

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,110
vice-president of the open source

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,360
initiative and the author of this the

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,670
first and only book on how to contribute

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,410
to open source software so your only

00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,490
pitch you're gonna get this entire thing

00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,960
is please buy my book because it rocks

00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:59,140
this is my contact information I do

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,150
encourage you to use it now let me do

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:04,150
what we call in management and

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,650
consulting setting up expectations you

00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,990
are probably going to be very glad to

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:11,110
hear that this talk ain't gonna go the

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:14,110
whole hour I think around 40 minutes so

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,000
you can go and get lunch early but that

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,390
will probably be the only part of the

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,100
keynote that you will be pleased to hear

00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:23,020
there's going to be some hard truths

00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,000
there's going to be some real talk and

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,720
there's going to be pictures of cute

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,740
animals so that should help but first

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,380
we're going to start by talking about

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,060
science so science yay science I love

00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,340
science so specifically we're going to

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:41,620
talk about ecosystems what are they what

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:43,120
even is an ecosystem well this is 2018

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,520
if you want to learn something about a

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,350
new concept you go to Wikipedia where

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,090
anybody with an internet connection and

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:54,010
an attitude can become an expert so this

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,350
is what wikipedia says about ecosystems

00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,660
and yes I am going to read it because

00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,670
not everybody can see the screen

00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,890
a community is made up of living

00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:06,100
organisms and nonliving components such

00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,960
as air water and mineral soil ecosystems

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,650
may be studied either as contingent

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,940
collections of plants and animals or as

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,610
structured systems and communities that

00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,350
are governed by general rules so it's

00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,110
long it's unwieldy but it's very

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,210
specific so I like things that are

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,870
shorter and easy to consolidate to

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,730
people notice this talk is going short

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,500
so I go to the dictionary everybody's

00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,570
favorite snarky internet dictionary

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,450
they're amazing on Twitter this is how

00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,850
they define an ecosystem as the complex

00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:38,800
of a community of organisms and its

00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,560
environment functioning as an ecological

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,120
unit short sweet to the point this is

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,500
what my ecosystem is and it's what I'm

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,960
going to be discussing throughout this

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:52,060
entire keynote today

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:53,920
and ecosystems are everywhere everywhere

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,660
you look there is an ecosystem they can

00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,140
be absolutely massive like the Sahara

00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,990
Desert

00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:01,030
or they can be really tiny like a

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,880
backyard pond smaller than a bathtub

00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,280
just big little ecosystems can be

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,340
composed of smaller ecosystems and

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,490
they're not simply environmental and

00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:15,540
ecological because we humans like to use

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,190
this word to describe industries and

00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:20,890
investments and technologies and any

00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:23,169
other human undertaking we describe them

00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,270
in terms of ecosystems they are

00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,490
everywhere but right now I'm just going

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,470
to focus on natural ecosystems the ones

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,289
you typically think about when I say the

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,750
word ecosystem now every natural

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:36,969
ecosystem out there every single one has

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,940
to have these four components in order

00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:41,830
to be successful you have those things

00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:45,850
that other things live on or move

00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:48,760
through like air land water and then you

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:52,720
have those very very vital pieces that

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,700
turn sunlight into energy because those

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,560
vital base producers are then consumed

00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,330
nom-nom-nom they're consumed by the

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,880
consumers who then consume other

00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,130
consumers nomnomnom lots of eating going

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,750
on here but eventually the consumers

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,640
will go away as will all of the other

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,880
elements here and you need the

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,160
decomposers because the decomposers help

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,290
to maintain a site

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:18,000
and a balance in the ecosystem and that

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:20,040
is key because balance is key large

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,560
small it doesn't matter what size or

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,750
what nature they take all ecosystems

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,740
must maintain the correct balance in

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:30,270
order to operate or even to exist at all

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,940
so too much of one part in an ecosystem

00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:35,580
or not enough of another and the entire

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,960
ecosystem is thrown out of whack now I'm

00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,530
going to start with what has become the

00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:44,130
textbook example of ecosystems literally

00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,970
you find it in textbooks so who here has

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,080
heard of the wolves in Yellowstone

00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,910
National Park

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,820
not everyone that's good because I'm

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,800
gonna tell you the story anyway so it is

00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:57,680
now story time let me tell you about the

00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:00,270
Wolves back in the mid 1800s

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,730
thousands of settlers they migrated

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,760
across this country of ours to the

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:07,500
western reaches of North America and as

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,870
they found new locations for their homes

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,450
they did what seemed reasonable at the

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:16,020
time and that is they killed anyone and

00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:18,480
anything that they feared and one of the

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,650
things they feared were wolves wolves

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,900
were one of the victims of this

00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,950
expansion because wolves like to eat

00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,800
livestock

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,420
nom-nom-nom they also sometimes like to

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,980
eat people but mostly they preferred

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,330
livestock because livestock didn't fight

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,330
back quite as much and didn't have guns

00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:35,490
so the end result of this is that by the

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:38,250
20 end of the 20th century sorry the

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,470
beginning of the 20th century all wolves

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,880
were either killed or driven out of the

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,550
area that became Yellowstone National

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,730
Park in Wyoming no more wolves no more

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:50,520
puppies this myth that the settler

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:53,280
livestock was safe no more wolf

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,590
predation but it also meant that not

00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,420
just the livestock were safe but all of

00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,610
the other animals in what became

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,770
Yellowstone they also were no longer

00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,820
getting eaten by wolves and that sounds

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:06,030
great right

00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:09,830
no voracious beasts chasing you down and

00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:14,700
eating you yay this is progress awesome

00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:17,340
but despite that progress in the 1990s

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,410
some folks thought well maybe we should

00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,360
bring back the wolves maybe we should

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,220
bring them back to Yellowstone perhaps

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,819
now this is just a crazy thought perhaps

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,559
killing all of them

00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:31,779
was quite literally overkill so I'm sure

00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:34,569
the fact that this land was no longer

00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:37,119
really being used for grazing and so

00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:39,369
there was no longer any money in it that

00:11:37,119 --> 00:11:41,379
had no factor in at all and bringing

00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:43,029
back the Wolves none at all but it

00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:44,439
doesn't matter they did it it doesn't

00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:47,079
matter why but they did this and they

00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:48,519
relocated some wolf families to the park

00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,660
and they kept a really close eye on them

00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,369
because he's a scientists and that's

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:55,629
what they do they keep a close eye on

00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:57,999
things so for all those years in nearly

00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:59,919
a hundred years there had been no apex

00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:02,139
predators in the Yellowstone National

00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,819
Park that hadn't been that top of the

00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:09,519
food chain because we had killed off all

00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:11,410
of the Wolves water and because we had

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,139
killed off all the wolves for nearly a

00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:17,769
century the Elks had been having an

00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:19,329
amazing time these guys were so happy

00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:21,759
they had been eating whatever they want

00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:23,559
they were wandering all over the place

00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,919
doing whatever they wanted and making

00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:29,189
tons of little baby elk so once in a

00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:32,889
while sure a bear would take one out

00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:33,939
once in awhile but in general they

00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:36,369
pretty much had the run of the place

00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:41,409
along with what remained of their bison

00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:43,059
friends now the thing about elk is they

00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:45,089
are pretty indiscriminate about what

00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:48,429
they eat they have their preferences

00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:50,649
they actually prefer willows down along

00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:52,720
the stream very tender very juicy very

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:54,009
tasty they'd like the willows so they

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,679
have their preferences but they'll eat

00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:59,379
anything they will eat trees grasses

00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:01,629
whatever doesn't matter so in the past

00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:03,369
century while the Wolves were gone and

00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:06,069
the Elks were having a great big elk

00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:07,329
party they were nibbling on things and

00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:09,069
they would go to one spot and they

00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:10,899
wouldn't give a little nibble and nibble

00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:12,459
everything down and then they would move

00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:15,100
to another spot and then nibble nibble

00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:17,169
nibble nibble all the plants down now

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,569
again they were very fond of willows but

00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:21,850
they would eat anything now things were

00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:24,069
not bare they weren't completely bare

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,999
here but the plants didn't have a lot of

00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:30,419
opportunity to grow very tall either so

00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:34,720
TLDR you had lots of out low vegetation

00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:37,419
and then the Wolves came and the Wolves

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,400
showed up and what they saw a raid in

00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:43,400
front of them

00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:47,010
was and all-you-can-eat elk buffet I

00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,420
mean there were elk everywhere so

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,400
naturally when there's so much food

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,710
lying around the walls at you as you

00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,690
would imagine they did pretty well they

00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:57,090
multiplied and they stuck around and the

00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:00,450
scientists look at this and they said go

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:03,300
us yes we are successful this is a great

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,860
experiment mark went up for science so

00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,750
that was great but the scientists being

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,310
scientists they kept an eye on things

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,570
because experiments sometimes take a

00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,790
long time so they kept an eye on things

00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:17,010
and they noticed some things they didn't

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:18,600
expect so the wolves they're smart

00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:23,700
creatures right they're like dogs and

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,470
they figured out hey elk like Willow so

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,700
they would hang out by the water where

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,080
the willows were because they knew the

00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,370
elk would be coming by because elk

00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,640
wanted to go in nibble nibble nibble

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:35,340
write the elk also surprisingly not

00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,410
stupid they figured out that if I want

00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,970
willow there's going to be some sort of

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,440
wolf waiting for me that so they would

00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,390
show up they get a bite and then they

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,880
bugger out right because they didn't

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:47,820
want to get eaten by wolves so what this

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,180
did is it allowed the willows to grow a

00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,580
lot more they got a lot taller and they

00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:57,000
provided a lot more shade and that shade

00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:59,040
provided habitats for fishes and what

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,290
you ended up with was a very large

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,750
increase in the population of fishes in

00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:06,630
Yellowstone National Park but that's not

00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:09,480
all they did the Willows also provided

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,490
building material and food for beavers I

00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,520
don't know what it is about willow but

00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,320
people critters like eating it now I

00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,600
kind of want to go taste some willow but

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,100
um so the Beavers

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,360
like to eat the willow as well but they

00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,620
couldn't before because it wasn't enough

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,080
the elk would just nibble nibble nibble

00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,670
and it was gone so they returned to

00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,610
streams once more once the willows were

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:31,440
available to them and they had food now

00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,680
the return of the Beavers beavers have a

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,720
tendency to do this they build dams now

00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,540
these dams increase the habitat for fish

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,930
so you got even more fish how cool is

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,330
that

00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:44,520
fish are great but it also led to the

00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,680
beaver dams changing the flow of the

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,690
streams back into the channels that they

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,560
had before the Wolves disappeared and

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,810
that doesn't seem

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,760
sniffing it's just a stream changing but

00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,640
when the streams were there the

00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,290
grasslands were healthier so with the

00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,880
streams returned the grassland also got

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,260
healthier and so there were more birds

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,360
and more bison and more bear and

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,400
everyone was happy because the Wolves

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,900
came back

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,870
scientists returning the Wolves did so

00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,339
much more than anyone expected it

00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:15,640
rebalanced an ecosystem in what was

00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:20,800
called a trophic cascade and that is an

00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:22,810
important term what is a trophic cascade

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,360
we're talking a powerful indirect

00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:29,380
interaction that can control the entire

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,120
ecosystem now it can come top-down when

00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,029
you remove a big predator like the

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,640
Wolves it can also come bottom-up when

00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:38,290
you remove those base producers right at

00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,390
either end of the spectrum it doesn't

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,460
matter when either of these occur and

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,740
you remove these from the equation the

00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:47,560
ripple effects it cascades throughout

00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,839
all parts of the ecosystem now a trophic

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,730
cascade is not usually considered a good

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,650
thing as you can probably imagine but

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:57,220
partly it's because it can lead to a

00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:59,050
cascade effect too long in a trophic

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,370
cascade you reach cascade effect and I

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,050
know I'm sorry

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,209
trophic cascade sounds like cascade

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,920
effect I apologize blame the scientists

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:09,550
but this is what we're going to work

00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,370
with here so trophic cascade is your

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:14,500
starting that downward trend cascade

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:17,470
effect you have gone off the cliff and

00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,589
you aren't are on a fast path to an

00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:23,140
extinction level event so a cascade

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,810
effect it can be caused by the extension

00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,030
the extinction of a key species but it

00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:30,010
also can be caused by introducing a new

00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,900
species that doesn't have any predators

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,630
in there either way it doesn't matter

00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:39,090
because the imbalance becomes so bad the

00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:43,110
entire ecosystem collapses and it dies

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:46,150
so it's story time again so last century

00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:48,970
pacific sea otters they were hunted

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:51,820
nearly to extinction we human beings we

00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:53,970
seem to really like otter fur but we

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,980
prefer it if the otters are not inside

00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:59,740
so

00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:02,169
so we killed the otters and so while in

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,570
the Yellowstone example the wolves were

00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:05,740
the apex predator right they were at the

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,720
top of the food chain

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,490
otters are not at the top of the food

00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,419
chain the top of their food chain is

00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:15,460
actually the great white shark and so

00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:19,059
what but what otters are is they're

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,860
known as a keystone species now how many

00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:23,740
of you know about the keystone on an

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,960
arch it's that piece right at the top

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,380
where if you remove it the entire arch

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,240
collapses that is what the otter is in

00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,890
its particular ecosystem it was the

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,440
keystone species and when you remove it

00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:38,610
the entire ecosystem collapses and we

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,429
removed it now why did it all collapse

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,620
it's because otters eat sea urchins they

00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:45,970
love this funny little buggers they will

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,799
eat them night and day they think are

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:51,250
they they are the best thing ever

00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:53,890
so when the otters went away the sea

00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:56,200
urchins were really stoked they were

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,580
like OMG no more predators how great is

00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,500
this so they found they could do

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,450
whatever they wanted and what sea

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,750
urchins really want to do more than

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:07,270
anything else is eat kelp so the urchins

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:09,789
ate some kelp and the urchins multiply

00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,230
and then the urchins eights more kelp

00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:12,820
and then the urchins multiplied some

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:15,039
more it was great for the urchins they

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,480
were really enjoying this except they

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,760
multiplied so much that they ate all of

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,289
the kelp and then there were no more

00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:24,820
urgent's all of the urchins died

00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:27,370
now the kelp that the urchins were

00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:30,130
eating it was home to hundreds of other

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,899
species so when the kelp went away all

00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,600
of those other species went away too

00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:38,049
they either died or they moved away and

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,270
this led to massive pieces of the

00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:44,110
coastline of North America on the west

00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:47,049
coast they became deserts the ecosystem

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:51,270
had suffered a massive trophic cascade

00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:51,270
due to the near extinction of otters

00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,429
thankfully in this case at least the

00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:59,200
process could be reversed otters they

00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:02,620
became protected as an endangered

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,120
species yay great idea so scientists

00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,399
took some of them that were still a few

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,510
by Alaska and they brought them down and

00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:12,020
they put them down around Monterey

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:14,150
in California coast and after several

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,790
years of the otters being there down

00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:18,620
near the Monterey Coast they the cascade

00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:21,500
effect disappeared the kelp came back

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,660
and balance was returned to that

00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,640
ecosystem

00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:28,150
unfortunately most cascading ecosystems

00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,150
are not that lucky

00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,230
so yes cute animals we love them they're

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,580
adorable

00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:40,070
they're awesome but what does this have

00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:42,080
to do with Perl every single programming

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,419
language every free and open source

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,910
software community each and every one of

00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:50,090
them has an ecosystem now some of you

00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:53,840
may recognize this this is a sea pan

00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:55,970
diagram that Brian defy made in 2011 you

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,850
can see how the different pieces of the

00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:01,549
sea pan ecosystem interact and this is

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:04,340
just sea pan right it's not even the

00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:06,320
entirety of the Perl world this is just

00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:09,320
one piece of it and each piece here

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,360
could be its own sub ecosystem so if you

00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,309
look at Sipan testers here that's

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,130
actually its own little ecosystem its

00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:18,679
own world and sea pan itself is again

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:25,130
contained within the ecosystem of pearl

00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:27,830
it is ecosystems all the way down now

00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,360
just like natural ecosystems free and

00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,910
open source software ecosystems they

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,840
also have elements that they must have

00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:38,150
in order to be successful you have

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,760
infrastructure just the basic nuts and

00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,809
bolts of keeping things running

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,429
obviously you have the project you have

00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:45,440
the code it's documentation please

00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:47,690
document in code you have the code it's

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,040
documentation its tests right that's

00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,660
another element that everything must

00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,220
have those are the technical sides of

00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,840
things then you have the people side of

00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,120
things which are the users and the

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,970
maintainer --zz without a user for your

00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,220
project why do you even have a project

00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:03,530
it has no reason for being so users are

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,350
very important but maintainer ZAR also

00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:08,270
important because otherwise that entire

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,710
project will die it will not be

00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,570
maintained it will be full of bugs

00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:14,059
nobody will want to use it the users

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,280
will go away the project will go away

00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:18,679
all right so obviously this is an

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,979
oversimplification of a very complex

00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:26,639
system but it's a useful one

00:22:21,979 --> 00:22:30,119
so also like the natural world Pearl has

00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:32,159
a river now Pearl has been around for 30

00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:34,349
years happy birthday pearl so prou has

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,879
been around for 30 years so this concept

00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:38,759
is relatively new in the pearl world

00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:41,639
it's only been around since 2015 the QA

00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:44,849
hackathon at 2015 and this is the Civic

00:22:41,639 --> 00:22:47,399
the Sipan River now this is a model to

00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:51,719
help ensure a healthy ecosystem for

00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:53,069
Sipan modules pro/5 I'm sorry for y'all

00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:56,909
over here I got a pointer at this side

00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:59,969
so pro/5 is up here in and this is the

00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:02,789
source of the river modules in Sipan

00:22:59,969 --> 00:23:06,089
they're then located on the river based

00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:09,479
upon how many other modules directly or

00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:11,939
indirectly depend upon them so if you

00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:15,119
break a module anywhere on this river

00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:16,589
you break everything downstream of it if

00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,079
you have a module on which nothing

00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:21,629
relies nothing has it as a dependency

00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:24,569
then it gets to swim out here in the

00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:27,959
ocean free it is free in the sea of

00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:32,159
Sipan so the closer modules are placed

00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:34,409
on the river to the p5p source the more

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,109
they are directly or indirectly relied

00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:39,629
upon a by other things and so therefore

00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:44,639
the more stuff they can break if they

00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:46,589
themselves do something wrong this is a

00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:48,569
quote from the blog post where where

00:23:46,589 --> 00:23:50,879
Neal Bowers who apologizes for not being

00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:52,379
here he misses you all by the way where

00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:55,589
he first wrote about the sea pan River

00:23:52,379 --> 00:23:57,509
and what he says here is if you pollute

00:23:55,589 --> 00:24:00,359
a river you might cause problems for

00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:02,369
everyone downstream of you and you're

00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:04,799
relying on the distributions upstream of

00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:07,499
you not polluting the river now the

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,809
river is an excellent way to visualize

00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:12,959
and talk about the overall health of the

00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:16,409
technical ecosystem of pearl so whoever

00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:19,079
was at the 2015 QA hackathon with with

00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:21,209
Neal Bowers and everyone great this is

00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:23,219
great work this is an excellent tool it

00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:25,469
is super effective for helping discuss

00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:28,619
the complexities of Sipan module

00:24:25,469 --> 00:24:31,669
interactions I love it so that's the

00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:31,669
technical side of things though

00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,510
but because there are people involved

00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,070
the technical aspects aren't the only

00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,080
important part and they might not even

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,180
be the most important part there's a lot

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,880
more to it than that

00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,920
for instance let's take the reputation

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,740
the reputation of an ecosystem as well

00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,890
as its constituent parts let's talk

00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,300
about that so I don't know how many of

00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,910
you know a lot of you probably don't

00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:02,470
know me a lot of you do I travel a lot I

00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:05,320
do this a lot I speak at tons of free

00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:07,930
and open source software events and I

00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,450
help so many different communities do so

00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,380
many different things right I am NOT

00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,530
just Perl

00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:18,730
I'm let's call me free and open source

00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:20,260
Minister without portfolio so in the

00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,060
course of going to all these events I

00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,400
speak with hundreds of people every year

00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,590
and Perl comes up way more often than

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,200
you would imagine it comes up all the

00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:34,050
time but it means I get to see the Perl

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:36,250
ecosystem through the outside world and

00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,420
of course the very first thing a lot of

00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,740
people talk about because these are

00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,360
technical conferences they talk about

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,350
the technical side of it and they talk

00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,690
about the language and the lake

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,580
reputation of the language and they say

00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,480
things that you've all heard so many

00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:50,260
times over the years

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,230
Perl unreadable that's and they like to

00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:57,250
chuckle to themselves haha

00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:59,140
Perl is that still around or Perl the

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,760
more serious people Perl is not a modern

00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,580
language and it isn't fit for modern

00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,190
tasks those that's the serious technical

00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,840
rebuttal that you will get to Perl we

00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,880
need to speak to people but most of you

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,800
know in this room it's really easy to

00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,270
address these comments with hard facts

00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,450
and myth-busting z' because they're

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:19,420
based on outdated information you all

00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:21,760
know that Perl can be readable we have

00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:24,220
best practices you all know that it's

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,750
very modern and that you can do amazing

00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:29,130
brilliant things with Perl so it's

00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:33,610
pretty easy to refute these out-of-date

00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:35,980
conceptions with modern information but

00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,510
all too often the people I meet they

00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,630
share comments about the reputation of

00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:43,720
the Perl community from the outside what

00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,740
are they seeing and these these stories

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,530
they tell me

00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:49,600
very rarely complimentary and they're a

00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:51,550
lot harder to address than comments

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,010
about the language because these are

00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:57,700
based on their personal experiences and

00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:58,750
their current information so often

00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,309
people will share with me the

00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:04,330
experiences they have had with the Perl

00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:06,280
community for instance I send a bug to a

00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:08,830
Sipan module and the maintainer closed

00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:14,350
it saying it was stupid and no one

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:16,690
should ever use the software that way my

00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:20,440
clickers not clicking there we go oops

00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:23,380
go back one I went to hash Perl on IRC I

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,820
went to the channel but I left after

00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:30,250
seeing how people were treating each

00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:31,809
other in their own community I had to

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,309
support a Perl script at work but I

00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:35,620
didn't understand it well so I went to

00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:41,080
my local Perl users group but they

00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:42,730
ignored me I met a group of Perl people

00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,520
at a conference but I felt really

00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,140
uncomfortable around them they kept

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,940
hitting on any woman who got near them

00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:52,390
and making rude comments about the women

00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:53,620
after they turned them down now these

00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:56,559
are all true stories they're all

00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:58,780
paraphrasing of just some these are only

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,580
some of these stories recently I have

00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,740
heard of people from their recent

00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,080
experiences with the Perl community from

00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,450
the outside and these are the mild ones

00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:10,690
I have heard far worse that I'm not

00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:12,640
sharing so there's a lot more hostile

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,350
and hostility that people are

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,920
experiencing trying to enter your

00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:20,530
community so however things may appear

00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,170
to you here on the inside I can assure

00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:26,940
you that the outside world does not view

00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:29,230
the Perl community in a good light and

00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,480
all of these experiences that people

00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:33,700
shared with me each and every one they

00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,950
occurred after the institution of the

00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,370
standards of conduct which I'm sorry

00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:41,080
does not speak well to those standards

00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:44,050
those standards in which many members

00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,790
just obviously don't believe or rust

00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:48,700
these experiences would never occur

00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:50,890
those standards which a lot of other

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,260
people obviously are not upholding

00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:56,120
otherwise these experiences would be

00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,010
denounced but they're not

00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,440
this sort of behavior should be

00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:03,800
intolerable according to those standards

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:09,170
that you yourself have defined and yet

00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:13,400
it keeps happening as a community you

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:15,890
are what you tolerate so of unwelcoming

00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,710
behavior if that is tolerated then the

00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:20,420
community whether you like it or not is

00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,430
unwelcoming and if you don't agree with

00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:26,750
unwelcoming behavior but you turn a

00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:31,010
blind eye and you let it happen then you

00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:32,570
are part of the problem so a lot of

00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,830
people didn't tolerate this behavior a

00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,470
lot of people saw it and they were like

00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:38,360
no I'm gonna vote with my feet I have an

00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:40,480
opportunity to leave and I'm going to do

00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,690
it I will go to another community and

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:47,330
even more people those external examples

00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:49,100
I listed above they took one look at the

00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:50,930
community they turn tail and they walked

00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:54,200
away and they never joined to begin with

00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:56,780
and I support this very very strongly if

00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,440
you're in a bad situation or if you see

00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:02,030
a bad situation you get out full stop

00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,410
you have the power to do that and I

00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,930
support people doing that but

00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:07,610
unfortunately people getting out it has

00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,760
a side effect and that side effect is

00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:12,680
leaving behind an even higher

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,550
concentration of tolerance for bullies

00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,840
and and a lot of you out there

00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:20,390
probably looking at me and getting

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,100
really angry and saying no you are wrong

00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,980
there are good people in this community

00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,450
and I'm gonna say yes you are right

00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:30,260
there are amazing people in this

00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:32,540
community just brilliant kind wonderful

00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:35,210
human being you have Sawyer you have RJ

00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,550
BS gene hack peregrine tribe Wendy Liz

00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,350
there are so many brilliant people in

00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,700
this community that people outside are

00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,930
never going to experience because they

00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,930
won't give your community a second

00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:48,950
chance Larry well himself Larry here is

00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:51,580
in my experience the kindest human being

00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:56,270
in all of free and open-source software

00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:58,340
full-stop and I know all of them but

00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,110
that kindness it's not appreciated

00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,690
nearly as much as it deserves and it is

00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:05,750
certainly not reflected in the external

00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:08,650
reputation of the perl community so no

00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:11,740
it's not all bad but it's also

00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:13,750
not balanced either due to the attrition

00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,270
over the years caused by the more toxic

00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:18,450
influences of the community there is

00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:21,610
this massive imbalance between

00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:24,610
kindnesses and er II and again

00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:27,790
you are what you tolerate and as the

00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:33,130
community the community that remains it

00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:34,960
allows as Hillary to continue all signs

00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:38,410
every single one of them point to the

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,170
pearl ecosystem favoring technology over

00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:44,110
community and rather than fostering a

00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,730
balance of both what you see on the

00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:48,480
screen here is the motto of the humane

00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:51,310
development movement we are humans

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,450
working with humans to develop software

00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:57,250
for the benefit of humans now judging

00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,410
from the reports I get from people

00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,140
external to the community the Perl

00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:04,870
version of this motto looks like this

00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:07,960
the people are gone you focus on the

00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:11,890
technology rather than the people rather

00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:16,150
than having balance so right about now

00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:17,200
I'm going to take a drink right about

00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,690
now some of you are probably asking

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,040
yourself what in the hell is my point

00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:25,690
anyway and you are fair to say that

00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,790
after all I have spent all of this time

00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,950
telling you about cute little puppy dog

00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:32,470
wolves and adorable little otters and

00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,510
then I launched into a screed about

00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:36,270
toxic communities so what is going on

00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:39,130
here

00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:41,050
remember trophic cascades indirect

00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,930
actions controlling entire ecosystems

00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:46,300
that is what pearls toxic community is

00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:49,570
doing it has taken control of the

00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:54,610
ecosystem a cascade is right now in

00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:57,720
progress and has been for many years it

00:32:54,610 --> 00:33:01,240
doesn't matter which chart you look at

00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:04,690
every single one of them shows the same

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:07,180
trend a trend you are all already very

00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:09,970
familiar with and that is the decline of

00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:12,610
the pearl ecosystem and it's not because

00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:15,460
of the language the language as you all

00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:18,040
know is really very very good and Sipan

00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,990
is amazing in Sipan testers please steal

00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,790
this pitch every other language out

00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:24,670
there right the language

00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:26,500
the technical side is great it's not a

00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:29,500
technological problem that is causing

00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,270
this decline it's a people problem every

00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,690
single one of these charts if you notice

00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:37,030
they are edging down to zero and that

00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:39,490
means that this ecosystem is not in a

00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:41,740
trophic cascade it is in a full-blown

00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,570
cascade effect it is headed toward

00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,910
extinction because it has allowed

00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:51,340
technology side to become out of balance

00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:52,810
with the people side but we learned we

00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,360
learn from the otters and the kelp and

00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:59,260
the sea urchins it is possible to

00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:03,180
reverse a cascade effect it is possible

00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:06,700
to avoid extinction events it's not easy

00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:09,220
it's not it requires intention it

00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:14,770
requires a tension and it requires time

00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:17,020
and patience but it can be done going

00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:18,600
back to the sea pan River remember how I

00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:21,100
said it is a great way to visualize

00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,740
technical health because it is this is a

00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,540
wonderful metaphor and model so again

00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,520
kudos to all y'all for coming up to this

00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,790
so what if we were to visualize the

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:34,870
health of the pearl community right now

00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:36,610
we could do it like this and you know

00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:38,110
however accurate a it may be

00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,330
particularly for people on the outside

00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:42,520
looking in if this is not useful for

00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:45,520
actually taking action so how about

00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,460
instead you build upon the proven

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,560
metaphor of a sea pan River expand upon

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,970
it with like a community River or I

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,100
don't care it doesn't matter whatever

00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:57,310
metaphor makes sense just find some way

00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:59,200
some way to visualize and talk about the

00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:01,270
overall health of the community part of

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,430
the pearl ecosystem like you can with

00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:07,000
the sea pan the technical side of the

00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:08,860
pearl ecosystem and once you can

00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,230
visualize that community health once you

00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:15,250
can look at it and picture where things

00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:17,920
are in the greater scheme of things then

00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:20,260
you can start taking action and you can

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,420
take considered action that you know is

00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,550
going to make a considered effect so

00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,610
what sort of actions can you take to

00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:28,450
start to move things back into balance

00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,900
well I'm not going to tell you yet

00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:35,460
because I have another story

00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:38,430
so this is a story of another ecosystem

00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:41,280
that was successful and it's time to

00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:44,510
learn about puffins and oh my god I love

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,770
puffins they are so cute so

00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:50,130
puffins are amazing they're cute little

00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:52,470
sea birds they are not poor defense so

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,360
years ago puffins used to be incredibly

00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:57,420
common across the northern Atlantic

00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,200
shore in North America they were

00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,830
everywhere

00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,400
they were like seagulls except cute so

00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,760
um

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,250
sailors though it way back when they

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,890
decided that puffin eggs puffin eggs are

00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,960
really tasty and you know what else is

00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:15,990
tasty

00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:17,580
puffins so the sailors they would stop

00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,110
at all the little islands and rocks

00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,030
along the coast and they would collect

00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,990
eggs and they would shoot some birds and

00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:25,850
they would take them back to the ship

00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:29,160
and they would have a great meal awesome

00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:31,500
but the thing about puffins is they're

00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,560
one of those birds who returned to breed

00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,750
on the island where they're raised and

00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,730
then when they do that they only lay one

00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,260
egg and they do it in this shallow

00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,730
little tunnel and I haven't seen

00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,760
pictures of how they dig the tunnel but

00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:46,860
I really curious so they lay one single

00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,040
egg in this shallow tunnel but if those

00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:52,350
single eggs if those are collected then

00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,850
none of them are hatching and if the

00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,260
birds themselves are collected and no

00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:58,020
new ones are hatching then you know

00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,360
who's gonna lay more eggs no one so as a

00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:02,340
result as you would expect the puffins

00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:05,990
disappeared particularly along the

00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:09,390
coastline of the state of Maine by 1901

00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:12,420
puffins only existed on one tiny little

00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:14,910
pathetic miserable Rock near the state

00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,520
of Maine there were more near Greenland

00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:20,360
but overall they were headed toward

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,220
extinction they were in a cascade effect

00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:25,800
but then in 1969 there was a scientist

00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:29,340
Stephen kress and he looked at his

00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,920
lovely state of Maine he's like we could

00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:34,020
really use some puffins around here so

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,480
he gathered together this small plucky

00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,820
team of scientists and they went to

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,860
Greenland and they gathered chicks and

00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:43,410
they put them in little soup cans and

00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,430
they transported them into it an island

00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:48,480
off the coast of Maine

00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:51,930
and their thought was okay now if we can

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,819
raise these chicks then when they become

00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,410
adults they'll come back and they'll

00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:57,450
make their nests on this island where

00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,549
they were raised let's try it let's see

00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:02,250
what happens so they did raise these

00:37:59,549 --> 00:38:04,770
chicks and they hand fed them in these

00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:07,200
tiny little specially created tunnels to

00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,029
fit of little human hand right and they

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,890
raised them until they were strong

00:38:09,029 --> 00:38:16,230
enough to leave keep in mind they did

00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:19,980
this despite the disapproval of other

00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:22,500
senior scientists these other scientists

00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:25,980
they said it's not humans place to

00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:30,660
change the natural course of things your

00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:33,839
your you shouldn't meddle don't meddle

00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,770
just observe the puffins let nature take

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,579
its course

00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:40,950
and obviously as we all know here those

00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:42,869
senior scientists they were kind of

00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,339
ignoring the fact that humans had

00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:46,890
meddled and had caused the puffins

00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:48,839
problem in the first place but it

00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:50,880
doesn't matter because our plucky little

00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:53,099
team of scientists ignored the senior

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,579
scientists and they went ahead and they

00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:58,640
kept moving and relocating and hand

00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:01,890
feeding puffin chicks for four years

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,170
nearly all of the chicks all nearly all

00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:07,289
of them survived and became adult

00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:08,880
adorable puffins and flew away but none

00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:12,990
of them were flying back none were

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,599
returning so the team was like huh what

00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:17,940
did we do wrong and then they thought

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,010
well maybe this island just doesn't look

00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,619
welcoming to other puffins because there

00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:24,990
are no puffins here so they set up a

00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:25,829
bunch of puffins decoys just tons of

00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,380
them on this rock

00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:30,000
fake puffins and this actually worked

00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,440
because the puffins they had raised were

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,510
flying over the island and they looked

00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,910
down the like oh my god there's a puffin

00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:37,910
party I want to be a part of that so

00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:40,289
they would land on the island and

00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:42,630
puffins despite being seabirds are

00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:47,670
actually not idiots so they would land

00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:48,839
to go hey you're not a real puffins but

00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:50,760
it didn't actually matter because they

00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:52,319
had landed and that was the important

00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,750
part to get them to land and once they

00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:56,130
landed the puffins were like yeah ok I

00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,600
guess I'll make a nest here I'm familiar

00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:02,010
with the area I'll stay

00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:04,770
and so they did and all told it took

00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:06,510
more than ten years but it worked the

00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:08,790
puffins resettle down the island and

00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:11,480
other islands nearby and now there are

00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:13,710
over 1,000 breeding pairs of puffins

00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,200
thanks to this plucky little group of

00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:18,060
scientists and they have pulled the

00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,750
puffins out of their trophic cascade and

00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:23,160
out of their cascade effect but very

00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,810
importantly those disapproving

00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,570
scientists those finger-wagging

00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:30,500
naysayers don't meddle with the puffins

00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:33,300
they admitted they were wrong and they

00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,250
started using this ship relocation

00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,010
method that the plucky little scientists

00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:40,500
had started themselves and now all told

00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:43,790
that method has been used to rebuild and

00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:47,460
sustain the populations of 47 other

00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:49,140
species of birds the scientists learned

00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,480
that they had been wrong and that they

00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:54,720
can take a hand to save a lot of very

00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,150
endangered species so that's a

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,530
heartwarming story yay humans helping to

00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:01,230
restore an ecosystem that they

00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:03,540
themselves had damaged but what it gives

00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:05,730
us is now a third data point more proof

00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,770
that it is possible to reverse damage in

00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:12,060
an ecosystem it's been done elsewhere

00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:14,180
and it can be done in pearl but where do

00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,180
you start

00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:22,770
absolutely most importantly it must come

00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:26,010
from the top Perl leadership must make

00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:28,200
this a top priority peer-reviewed

00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:31,050
studies have shown over and over again

00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,030
across all industries that if you have a

00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,800
change effort within an organization and

00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,720
you do not have support from the top I

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,920
don't care how grassroots it is it will

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:43,260
fail almost 100% of them will fail if it

00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,940
doesn't have support from the top so if

00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,350
the Perl Foundation and other leaders in

00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,070
the pearl ecosystem that they do not

00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:51,450
participate in if they do not support

00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:53,880
changing actively changing this

00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:57,420
community then the entire ecosystem will

00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:01,590
continue to cascade and it will reach an

00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:05,340
extinction event this doesn't simply

00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:07,290
mean blog posts from on high saying nice

00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,790
things and platitudes oh we're going to

00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,420
make a difference we're going to have

00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:12,400
standards of conduct

00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:15,250
and that will make everything better has

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,619
to be actions real actions meaningful

00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:21,510
actions but it's not just the people at

00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:24,010
the top everyone is responsible for this

00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:26,049
actions are necessary by everyone

00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,549
remember you are what you tolerate so if

00:42:26,049 --> 00:42:29,380
you see bad behavior and you allow it to

00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:31,930
happen it's as though you did it

00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,490
yourself but if you don't feel

00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:35,170
comfortable calling someone else out for

00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:38,230
their bad behavior because it is

00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:39,339
difficult and it is easy to do wrong you

00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:43,030
don't feel comfortable with that

00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:45,339
look at yourself check your own behavior

00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:47,799
first in every interaction you have

00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:49,990
inside of the community and outside of

00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:52,809
it don't just treat the people nice

00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:55,960
outside of the community do it inside as

00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:59,109
well and it doesn't take much can just

00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:01,599
be one small thing right small actions

00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:05,109
taken by a lot of people aggregate to

00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:09,450
huge change so what are some of those

00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:12,210
actions you can do for crying out loud

00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:14,680
enforce that standards of conduct

00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:17,710
standards of conduct code of conduct SOC

00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:19,180
COC I don't care what you call it that

00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:21,010
is just hiding behind terms if that's

00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,030
what you choose to argue about is what

00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,380
you're going to call this thing it

00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:25,540
doesn't matter what you call it it's

00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:28,240
what it contains within and what you do

00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:32,049
with it so to use a standards of conduct

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:34,150
properly please seek out receive and

00:43:32,049 --> 00:43:36,160
provide training on how to enforce it

00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:38,380
how to enforce it in such a way that

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,270
everyone is able to live up to those

00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:43,599
standards that you yourself have

00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:45,700
documented and if some people can't live

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,650
up to those standards then what that

00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,839
training will do is it will empower you

00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:52,299
and give you the training you need so

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:54,369
you can empathetically show people the

00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:56,470
door if they can't live up to your

00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:57,339
standards so don't tolerate low

00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:00,150
standards anymore

00:43:57,339 --> 00:44:04,660
you're better than that don't tolerate

00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:07,480
unwelcoming behavior you are what you

00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:10,390
tolerate so if you tolerate

00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,579
what does that make you and what you see

00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:14,079
here is a book by Robert Sutton it is a

00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:15,670
business book it's about business and

00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,359
management and that sort of stuff it is

00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:20,980
the no rule it is brilliant well

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,920
it is about business and management it

00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:26,200
applies to all human organizations

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,090
it is just really well done I encourage

00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,350
everyone to go out buy it read it give

00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:33,190
it to a friend and then buy another copy

00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:35,920
for themselves it is that good so

00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:38,650
another thing that you can do is get the

00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,510
word out talk about it just like the

00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:42,160
puffins the puffins wouldn't land on an

00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:45,010
island until they saw birds like them

00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,990
there so the community you're not going

00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:49,960
to attract new people the community will

00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:52,120
not grow balance will not be regained if

00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,770
people outside of the ecosystem don't

00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,570
see that the ecosystem is getting

00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,700
healthier and right now they're not

00:44:55,570 --> 00:45:00,520
looking at you they're avoiding you

00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:03,790
give them a good positive reason to pay

00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:06,730
attention announce this be open be

00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:07,990
honest be sincerely apologetic about

00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:09,790
what has happened in the past and what

00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:13,600
you are doing to fix it in the future

00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:15,280
and then ask for feedback talk to people

00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,230
inside the community outside of the

00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,390
community how are we doing how can we be

00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:21,370
better and then follow through on that

00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:23,080
because asking for feedback and

00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:27,820
following through on it that's a great

00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:33,040
way to build trust so be loud about this

00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:37,300
be bold be humble and be authentic but

00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:40,360
don't you dare be in a rush you can't

00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:43,690
rush something like this it does take

00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:46,180
time to correct a trophic cascade and a

00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:48,670
cascade effect it took more than 10

00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:52,060
years from idea to success for the

00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:54,190
puffins more than 10 so these things

00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:56,650
take time it will take a while for this

00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:58,870
to start kicking in but all of this

00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:01,260
frankly it assumes that the cascade

00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:05,680
effect hasn't already gone too far it

00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:07,810
may in fact already be too late but that

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,830
doesn't mean you shouldn't try you

00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:17,500
should absolutely try because after all

00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:18,790
the alternative is not good these slides

00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,490
are already available on Internet

00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:35,410
Archive thank you for having me
