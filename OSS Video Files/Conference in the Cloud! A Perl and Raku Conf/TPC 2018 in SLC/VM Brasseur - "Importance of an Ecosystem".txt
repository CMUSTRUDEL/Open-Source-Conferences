Title: VM Brasseur - "Importance of an Ecosystem"
Publication date: 2018-06-19
Playlist: TPC 2018 in SLC
Description: 
	Inspired by the decimation then return of wolves from the Yellowstone ecosystem.

FOSS projects and communities can benefit from recognising that they’re not simply one focal point. Each one is an ecosystem. Ignoring or killing off one part of that system has dramatic (usually negative) impacts on the rest of the system. Sometimes these impacts can lead to extinction.

This keynote may discuss:

- The nature of ecosystems
- Examples of healthy and unhealthy ecosystems, both natural and FOSS
- Implications for P5
- More importantly, implications for P6 as it’s just starting its (hopefully long and productive) life
