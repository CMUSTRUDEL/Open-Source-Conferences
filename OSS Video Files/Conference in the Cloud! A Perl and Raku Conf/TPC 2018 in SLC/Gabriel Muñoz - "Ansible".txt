Description: 
	Server administration has a strong tradition with Perl programmers. Ansible is a tool for automating the orchestration of your infrastructure no matter how large or small. Combining it with your Perl skills is a way to empower your ability to go from code to deployment with confidence.

The goals are two-fold:

Introduction to Ansible as well as some other tools that I’ve found invaluable in getting things done with a Perl-based web application.
Real-world scenarios that show how Ansible stands apart when “orchestrating”, or changing up your software systems, whether they be enterprise servers or Raspberry Pis.
