	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:16,250
okay welcome to pearl quiz three so this

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:18,199
this is gonna be awesome there we go

00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:21,180
okay

00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,859
this was fun the last few years we've

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:31,260
done this so everybody gets to win a

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:33,780
prize so this is my wife Laura and I

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,489
work for zip recruiter hence the zip

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,500
recruiters t-shirts or these are

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,300
actually zip games t-shirts where we had

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,899
a big company party last week and played

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,360
lots of games so the point of this quiz

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,940
is is to learn ultimately we want to

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,399
learn we also want to measure our

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,530
knowledge how much of the obscure things

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,989
at Pearl do we know or do even care but

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,600
hey it's fun so the main thing is to

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,910
have fun now the questions themselves

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,699
some are going to be simple and really

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:06,119
easy for even for a beginner some

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,350
questions will be tricky so we might be

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,700
trying to fool you

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,890
and some questions will be things you

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,970
will never ever run into so you'll never

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,850
have to worry about unless we state

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,790
otherwise this has all the questions are

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:27,270
related to a recent version of pearl and

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,150
by recent I don't mean 526 or 528

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:34,490
necessarily so things might change in

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,829
some of those so think probably like 518

00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,450
522 somewhere on that range but most of

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,710
them it won't matter which version of

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,909
pearl there we can all be consistent the

00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,630
question types will vary there'll be

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,119
multiple choice

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,890
there will be fill in you'll need to

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,439
come up with an answer off the top of

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,670
your head and you don't need to worry

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,189
about whether or not you know the

00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:00,750
answers to most of the questions it's

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:03,719
okay and if you answer a question you

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,100
get a prize if you don't answer even if

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,840
you answer if you don't answer it all

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,250
you don't get a prize but if you answer

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,250
right or wrong you get a prize

00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:16,140
so you can write down the answers on

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,030
your paper a tablet laptop whatever you

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,910
want if you don't care you don't have to

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,490
write down the the answers at all and I

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,970
ask that you please be respectful and

00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:29,820
not shout out answers don't even talk

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,770
with your neighbour about the answer so

00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,440
we don't end up with somebody giving

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:39,810
somebody inadvertently the wrong answer

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:48,600
or the right answer okay is it already

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:59,040
on okay you don't need paper but you can

00:02:48,600 --> 00:03:03,360
use paper a little bit much okay so this

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:07,580
means I can take this one away cool it

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:11,190
looks like wait my hands more okay so

00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:15,480
what we will do is we will present the

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,070
question and and some of them are kind

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,170
of lengthy and you have to think about a

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:24,060
bit and so we'll pause and then if you

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,070
want to record an answer or just think

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:31,280
about it and then we will select

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:33,750
somebody to give their answer and

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,560
generally the way I do this is I just go

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:40,080
around the room in order so I'll clear

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,170
out one table after another doing the

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,810
answers so that person will give their

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,340
answer that I that I pick and so you can

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,360
kind of get an idea of when you're going

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,860
to get picked because they're just going

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:56,810
to go through the tables only one person

00:03:52,860 --> 00:04:00,120
will be selected for each question and

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,920
then we'll reveal the answer when after

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,720
the person's given their answer and then

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,680
we'll talk about it it's because there's

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,080
some that there's some interesting

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,810
points that we need to to know and share

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,270
about and others it's easy we only talk

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,640
about it some are kind of silly and then

00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:19,489
we will award a fabulous prize

00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:28,720
you know so get ready to record your

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:31,660
answers let's begin so number one

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,910
somebody says use strict is broken

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:39,140
because they did an assignment to dollar

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:45,980
a and then decided to say you strict

00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:47,810
afterward and it didn't complain so

00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,650
there's a Perl function that is actually

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:55,640
responsible for this now we're going to

00:04:51,650 --> 00:05:01,070
us pick somebody okay so we'll start at

00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:05,900
this table here then so so so your

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:07,550
answer is sort so nice you have to head

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,550
over to the gameshow console and hit

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,310
either red or that is correct the answer

00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:16,280
is sort so now we get to give you a

00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:18,320
prize now we have here prizes you can

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,430
sum you can choose from some you can't

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,740
some I will award you anyway so we have

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:28,340
these are metal water bottles that are

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,200
insulated we have batteries for your

00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:36,950
phone we have Bluetooth speakers we have

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:41,980
coffee mugs Bluetooth speaker a word

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,980
though the winner a Bluetooth speaker

00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:51,870
whoo okay question two this selfish

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,630
sounding keyword didn't exist before

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:57,990
Perl 5 it's faster and safer way to

00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:00,030
declare variables than local okay

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:11,580
back to this table rotating

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:15,630
counterclockwise our it is my so you

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:27,720
just won a three-disc deluxe edition set

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:31,230
of Twilight on DVD all the discs are

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,680
there I can't guarantee that with

00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,680
everything else

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:42,889
okay last person at that table so look

00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:48,540
at this code so we're creating a hash

00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:50,570
and we print the length of the hash what

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:59,120
is the answer

00:06:50,570 --> 00:07:02,240
ABCD efg or H I did

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,940
oh I didn't I didn't tell you the right

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:10,820
answer is my yeah I did yeah yeah we did

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:13,190
okay okay could you have the last

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,870
question no I think what you meant to

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:19,639
say is can I repeat the question the

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:21,229
answer is no now you can guess and you

00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,750
will still get a prize if it's you if

00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:24,979
you get it wrong if you get it right

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:28,840
yeah what we may get to the point where

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:28,840
you get what prizes are left

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:39,410
g60 - this is actually a tricky one

00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:42,710
because it depends which version of Perl

00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:44,270
you're running length expects a scaler

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,000
and when you when you used to put a

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,460
scalar in in list content or in array

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,650
context what it would do or sorry in

00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,050
scalar context it would return the

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:57,020
fullness of its buckets and you end up

00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:00,620
with a string that looks like 20 divided

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:04,340
by 32 and you go huh yeah and Larry

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:06,530
agrees it's not very useful so in more

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:16,580
recent releases it actually gives you a

00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:21,050
more meaningful number like - okay yeah

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:25,010
no no he gets he gets let's let's give

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:35,150
him this one are you smarter than a 5th

00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:39,940
grader a great game okay let's go with

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,940
the table behind here Theron you're up

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:47,260
what Perl command-line option tells you

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,260
where perl modules are installed

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:08,440
the command-line pearl no there you have

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,490
it because it's dependent on the system

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,890
so it's good there's a there's a

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:23,090
command-line switch they will tell you

00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:30,860
where your perl modules so you says

00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:33,650
capital okay so which letter is that no

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:41,690
I've got the letters up here which which

00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:43,810
answer is it B B as in David okay there

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,810
we go

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:53,630
correct

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:55,400
okay choose what would you like you one

00:09:53,630 --> 00:10:12,010
of those you only those fancy coffee

00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:21,140
mugs from zip recruiter okay great okay

00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:25,430
now we get bonus prize time yeah I love

00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:30,590
those okay next we're going around the

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:34,160
table so Graham you're up after

00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:37,580
execution of this Perl statement what

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,400
are the values of x and y assuming that

00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,380
they were undefined beforehand and we're

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,340
not using strict it should just doesn't

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,880
make any difference whether you seem

00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,880
strict on this

00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,940
you can put a ternary on the left side

00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:10,380
and so what it's doing is it's deciding

00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:13,560
which variable to assign seven to so X

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:16,010
is seven and Y is undef I don't know why

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:23,390
anyone would use it this way but you can

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:35,730
you can okay so we need a prize for him

00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:38,160
let's see and prizes yes yes so we have

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,800
since this was the bonus prize you get

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,660
to pick any of the prizes so this is

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:53,820
actually like the twice the complete

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:55,220
Twilight Zone fifth season on DVD okay

character that we put in front of pearl

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,730
variables there's a term that we use for

00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,730

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:45,540
when I asked her last year you don't

00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:51,079
know the answer is it just guess did you

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:57,510
say sigil that is correct

00:12:51,079 --> 00:13:01,430

a water bottle very good okay we have no

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:21,990
tables behind that one so we're going to

00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:25,760
start here so number seven which is the

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,760
following is not true

00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,890

00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,890
Diaz in Baker

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,660
d is in Baker you mean dear some David

00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:03,930
d is in david that is correct

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:07,170
the trick here is that the operator

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:10,800
controls how their the context for for

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,510
the comparisons and so when you have the

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,970
symbolic things like the greater than

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:17,580
symbol and so on it compares numerically

00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,740
but when you have the two letters like

00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,870
the GT that's the string greater than

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,580
comparator and so it converts those two

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:27,540
strings and so it's comparing the one

00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:31,130
character versus a seven character so

00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,130
that would be false okay

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:56,550
yeah we're assuming the bare words are

00:14:49,350 --> 00:15:01,530
being handled properly here okay

00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:04,320
next table back question eight how would

00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:07,860
I swap the values of two variables m and

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:16,680
n without using a temporary variable and

00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:22,890
we're gonna go with the B okay B is

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:24,510
correct Oh she'll run stuff out to you

00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,940
if you just can shout out what you want

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:29,750
or if you want us to go close some great

00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,750
board games here

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:40,800
one of the batteries yeah that's a cell

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:47,780
phone you can charge your cell phone

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:52,010
with that okay moving along here okay

00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:54,330
the other person at that's that table

00:15:52,010 --> 00:16:02,340
number nine which is about statement to

00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:06,870
give to the Perl preprocessor Diaz and

00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:10,260
Dana I've heard that word before so that

00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:14,029
is correct

00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,029
[Applause]

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:29,560
all right it's Bonus Time again okay so

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,630
we're going to the table behind that one

00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:42,850
over here in the maroon shirt you're

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:45,620
first I don't think you're eligible okay

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,870
imagine a boggle game where all the

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,990
cubes only have Perl regular expression

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:54,310
modifier flags on them I think I've

00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:57,080
played a boggle game that's like this

00:16:54,310 --> 00:17:06,530
which one of the following words cannot

00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:08,360
be spelled boggle boggle is a game where

00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:12,290
we have cubes that have letters on them

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:15,079
and they fall into a 5x5 grid and then

00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:18,500
you can only do a jacent letters and

00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:28,120
make up words it's it's a it's a word

00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:28,120
game so which one cannot be spelled

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:45,400
you're guessing be prairie okay turns

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:50,620
out the answer is much botulism there is

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:52,180
no B modifier it turns out that the

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,400
regular expression flags that are

00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,110
available we have a list of them there

00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,809
and there's some new ones that started

00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:04,390
with 514 and when 522 in his new at 522

00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:07,240
and I actually had an experience working

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:10,870
for a company where somebody used one of

00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,580
the newer Flags not realizing that our

00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,410
production servers didn't have that

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:22,120
version of Perl on them and it actually

00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:24,580
caused a minor problem you know I am Not

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,980
sure that it seems to me it was our and

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,650
we were using a really old version of

00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,540
Perl but I'm not sure that that's the

00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,860
one that actually was in that case so a

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,860
question over here for comment

00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,099
yeah you are

00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:50,320
good point good point

00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:09,759
so no no no well if you want to hand out

00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:15,969
Smarties to the people that they have

00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:18,340
good comments you can't you can also do

00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:23,229
double X you can do double e's that sort

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:26,440
of thing it depends on the version that

00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:29,080
you're doing now you can have this one

00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,979
of the best Star Trek movies or you can

00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:38,009
have Twilight Zone where you can have a

00:19:32,979 --> 00:19:41,909
board game sure you might be a redneck

00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:44,289
that's just fun to read the cards and

00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:48,399
the funny thing is is how many actually

00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:55,029
apply malarkey is a fun game okay great

00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:57,669
okay a purple shirt at that table you're

00:19:55,029 --> 00:20:00,809
up number eleven what is the maximum

00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:00,809
size of a scalar value

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:17,520
I can't hear you

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:25,410
Buse and boy 128 megabytes huh it's as

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:29,660
big as your memory louse so we need to

00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:32,660
give her a prize what would you like

00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,660
Wally

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:40,710
no I should point out this is a used

00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:45,710
wall-e puzzle but I counted the pieces

00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:48,750
they're all there but The Twilight Zone

00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:51,750
episode 4 complete season 5 has

00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,790
nightmare at 20,000 feet has all these

00:20:51,750 --> 00:21:00,270
great episodes but it's missing discs

00:20:53,790 --> 00:21:02,929
for sure sure yeah you can take one in

00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:08,460
the wrapping if you want or you can okay

00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:14,130
great okay we're going to the table

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:18,270
behind that one the guy in the blue

00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:22,640
shirt number 12 why is it frowned upon

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,640
to use grep in a void context

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:39,350
you're going with D D as in David okay

00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:48,480
the answer is that is B because it

00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:50,190
creates a list which is not used now

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,130
this is actually interesting because map

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,660
used to have the same problem if you use

00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,160
it avoid context that would actually be

00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,890
kind of slow because it's creating this

00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,290
this list that ends up being thrown away

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:04,070
but it's now smart enough that it in

00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:06,600
fact it's been quite a while since 581

00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:11,309
that it recognizes that and it doesn't

00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:12,809
generate the list okay do want to call

00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:17,550
out a prize or you want to come up and

00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:22,490
pick one okay while he's coming up we're

00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:22,490
gonna go to the lady at the table there

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,490
number 13

00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,490
[Music]

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:35,580
okay number 13 we have some auto

00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:49,760
increment going on here and what gets

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:56,520
printed D is in David which the which is

00:22:49,760 --> 00:23:04,010
B as in Baker so so you're saying a 1

00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:04,010
gets printed okay nice guess but it is B

00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:14,059
well it turns out that that unlike

00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:18,350
integers strings are handled differently

00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:19,850
and they are incremented as if just

00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:22,279
following the character so you go A to Z

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:26,629
and it goes back wraps around to a again

00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:28,220
so a would be incremented to be okay

00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:29,360
would you like us to bring back a prize

00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:41,629
to you you want to come up and select

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:48,350
one okay okay back at the front table

00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:51,769
here and yet the guy closest to me and

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:54,110
black shirt okay so this is similar to

00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:57,700
the previous one but it's a little bit

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,700
different what's the answer at this time

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:10,179
one so the answer is B okay that is

00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,179
correct

00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:38,020
okay so let's while he's selecting let's

00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:39,310
go on to the bonus prize okay guy and

00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:46,080
the other guy in black shirt at the

00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:46,080
table what is the equivalent to use foo

00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:00,950
normally it's letter D normally

00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:27,809
[Applause]

00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:43,659
it's part of the answer is correct

00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:47,669
okay okay glory we're coming to you I'm

00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:47,669
giving a coding question here in Gloria

00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:53,580
how would you create an array of arrays

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,710
oh let me see

00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:22,619
with see you are correct you actually

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,929
cannot create an array of arrays but you

00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:29,929
create instead an array of array

00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:29,929
references Wow

00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,720
good for you

00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,470
okay we'll go to the next table back the

00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:49,760
guy in the kind of blue and white almost

00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:53,320
looks Hawaiian shirt there how would you

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,320
get a reference to a list

00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:21,669
ay-ay-ay is interesting a is very

00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:22,869
interesting but it is wrong there's some

00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:24,789
actually there's some very interesting

00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:26,559
stuff with this because if you do this

00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:31,719
it actually it creates a reference to

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:33,009
just this string see and if you put the

00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:34,719
square brackets it just creates a

00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:40,539
reference to an anonymous array we're

00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:43,509
used to that that syntax but then we in

00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:45,759
in Perl we kind of treat arrays and

00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:47,799
lists interchangeable interchangeably

00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:51,129
but there are a few cases in which they

00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:52,749
are not and this is one of those so if

00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:54,279
we really need a reference to a list

00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:57,479
what we do is we turn it into array and

00:27:54,279 --> 00:28:01,859
then take the reference to the array

00:27:57,479 --> 00:28:01,859
okay so prize

00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:16,680
okay so we'll go while he's selecting

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:20,000
his prize we'll go to the next question

00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:24,180
number 18 so the next guy at that table

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,800
gentleman with the mustache how would I

00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:29,750
round a number to two decimal places

00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,750
using only built-in functions

00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:45,430
oh gee problem

00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:51,460
B Bravo that is correct and my thing

00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:54,970
jumped here s printf actually does round

00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:58,540
it may not round in all cases the way

00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:01,180
you wanted it to yeah

00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:05,170
so yeah you can think binary arithmetic

00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:07,750
for that so yeah there's some problems

00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:11,710
there but generally it'll it'll it'll do

00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:17,470
what you want okay we're going to the

00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:21,940
next table behind that Monsieur avec the

00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:23,380
the shimmies I don't know what's Brown I

00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:31,300
can't remember what Brown is in French

00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:32,230
but anyway hmm oui and please don't give

00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:36,460
your answer in French we won't

00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:37,780
understand okay number 19 who cheated

00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:43,690
here we're gonna have to skip that one

00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:45,760
and it jumped so so we'll explain this

00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:48,520
one because it revealed the answer but

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,730
anyway so if you wanted to do a take a

00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:56,020
string and reverse it you need to do it

00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:57,760
in scaler context so if you want F

00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:02,400
instead of feu you have to make sure

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:07,590
it's in scaler context okay

00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,590
so you got to the bonus prize here

00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:22,079
that is one of my most favorite videos

00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,079
[Music]

00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:31,709
you think about the port the poor guy in

00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:34,079
the car you know what's he gonna do so

00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:36,869
it didn't didn't see that coming okay

00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,029
number 20 we have a subroutine sub y

00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:41,639
print hello world and you try to make a

00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:46,669
call to it and it doesn't work it

00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:46,669
doesn't call it why doesn't it call it

00:30:46,820 --> 00:31:01,279
I'm not calling on you not yet

00:30:50,179 --> 00:31:01,279
how are you either come on a B C or D

00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:24,610
so I need to play the jeopardy theme no

00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,610
because the last thing that was revealed

00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,720
okay ready

00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:51,240
no out no clue okay so use your random

00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:54,120
number generator or random character

00:31:51,240 --> 00:32:08,160
generator to generate a list of four and

00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:18,690
pick a B C or D a the answer is d why is

00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:24,060
the translation operator yeah

00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:25,650
so less so it you try to call in and

00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:28,620
it'll call the translation operator it

00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:35,280
won't see it so it will show you how to

00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:46,560
fix that okay so you come up and get

00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:53,580
your prize I have a five pack of movie

00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:54,570
cards for Twilight if you would like

00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,050
that okay

00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,050
no problem

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,980
[Music]

00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:10,850
okay next question so we'll go to the

00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:18,680
guy in the teal shirt okay so how do we

00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:20,450
fix why how do we actually call why so

00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,620
we created this subroutine why and we

00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,690
want to call it and be doing a regular

00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:33,740
just say why in parentheses it doesn't

00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:38,750
work how do we actually call it a is

00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:40,640
correct we use the ampersand sigil so it

00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,530
recognizes that as a subroutine instead

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,910
of a function call and then you'll say

00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:45,910
or we could just rename the subroutine

00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:01,150
you talked about the previous number 20

00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:11,200
yeah it doesn't make any sense there

00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,200
yeah it's it's harmless

00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:27,359
oh yeah sure I probably know most of

00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:29,460
these might be a redneck so the Blue

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:35,549
Book value of the car depends on how

00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:37,409
much gas there's the way they think the

00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:38,659
cards on that game are interesting

00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:42,599
because they what they did is they took

00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:44,909
Jeff Foxworthy's quotes for his redneck

00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:48,450
jokes and put on the card and then they

00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:51,059
made up two more answers for first part

00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:52,230
of the statement and then you're

00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:58,319
supposed to guess which one is the right

00:34:52,230 --> 00:35:04,079
one it's pretty funny taken Bluetooth

00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:06,089
speaker one one price one price that's

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:11,670
it just the battery so what it's a

00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:12,869
battery right there just so if we go

00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:15,930
fast enough see we get to go another

00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:21,650
round again so okay next one at the

00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:24,210
table here okay we'll go to question 22

00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,690
you have a function reference dollar

00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,990
func

00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:30,420
and you call it as dollar ampersand

00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:34,369
dollar funk or func arrow is there a

00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,369
difference between the two calls

00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:45,410
which one B that is correct

00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:59,730
come get your prize I'm gonna on which

00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,230
one what are you talking about the

00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,500
function reference to dollar fine so

00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:10,410
dollar func would be a reference to a

00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:15,930
subroutine yeah the real function no

00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:19,860
it's actually a subroutine okay now the

00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:22,520
table behind that through the guy in the

00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:25,590
purple shirt of the white hat you're up

00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:36,690
number 23 how would you use a module

00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:39,330
without doing an import c-charlie okay

00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:43,220
that is correct you just give it an

00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,220
empty list and so it'll the import

00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,130
okay we're gonna while he's coming up in

00:36:51,960 --> 00:37:00,089
selecting a prize we're going to go to

00:36:53,130 --> 00:37:02,849
the the last one here number 24 there's

00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:06,570
a direct object syntax and an indirect

00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:09,140
syntax what is not a difference between

00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,140
the two

00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:25,810
Bluetooth speakers are gone there's no

00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:25,810
more in the box okay

00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:42,490
so what is the not a difference between

00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,490
a do

00:37:49,080 --> 00:38:02,350
yeah it would be the method name you so

00:37:53,860 --> 00:38:10,570
be Baker the answer is D either syntax

00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:18,070
allows arguments hey come on up and

00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:19,420
select a prize okay

00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,490
so we've gone all the way around

00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,250
everybody's participated unless somebody

00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:28,090
walks snuck in somewhere okay

00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:35,230
so we're gonna start back again here so

00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:37,990
bonus prize time no it doesn't matter

00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:41,340
you can pick whatever he likes when we

00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,340
run out of stuff we ran out of stuff

00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:53,680
it's a real wall-e puzzle okay how do

00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:57,880
you start up the perl debugger without a

00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:05,320
file to debug it's almost like a pearl

00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:07,000
shell pearl - Dee so close so close you

00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,430
need to have the minus e in there

00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,790
and you can combine them so it's a minus

00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:15,760
de and then you need to give it a script

00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,500
a string essentially to evaluate and if

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:23,290
you just give it a zero it starts up and

00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:25,030
does nothing yeah so that that will give

00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:27,280
you an interactive shell essentially to

00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:31,119
play with Perl so it's kind of fun

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:33,810
okay come up and select a prize okay

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,810
next one

00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:41,640
oK we've got about nine minutes left

00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:45,470
list two common ways to access without

00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,470
modifying the last element of an array

00:39:49,099 --> 00:40:01,499
meaning you can't pop no popping so how

00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,289
would you do that but how would you

00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:15,319
index into the last element of the array

00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:15,319
there's there's two ways to do that okay

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,420
so some a lot of people have programmed

00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:23,220
in Perl for a long time I didn't realize

00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,220
you can do a minus one and that will

00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:30,900
give you the last element minus two

00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:32,670
gives you the second-to-last element and

00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,170
so on and then of course there's a

00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,849
dollar pound variable for each array

00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:38,039
that's automatically created whenever

00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:39,239
you created an array so you just a

00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:40,589
dollar pound the name of the array and

00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:43,440
that'll give you the index to the last

00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:45,450
element of the array you can also put an

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,799
array in scalar context and it'll

00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,450
evaluate to the number of elements of

00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:50,430
the array which is one more than the

00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:51,930
index to the last element so then you

00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,460
just have to subtract one from that to

00:40:51,930 --> 00:41:00,749
be able to use it come on up and select

00:40:53,460 --> 00:41:02,670
a prize okay number 27 and a regular

00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:04,589
expression you can own you can use curly

00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:06,569
braces to specify how many times you

00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:09,390
want to match something for example

00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:13,680
we're doing X we want it to appear five

00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:15,299
to ten times what's the maximum number

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,779
of occurrences you can match with this

00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:17,779
technique

00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,260
d

00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:33,330
see Charlie David Diaz and David that is

00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,540
correct

00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,690
[Music]

00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,690
[Applause]

00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:41,390
okay over here a gentleman in the blue

00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:50,000
shirt

00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:53,350
Theron so we create a subroutine that

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,350
just isn't

00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,709
[Applause]

00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:08,829
how can we have something named isn't

00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:12,849
see isn't charlie that is correct

00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:22,089
it's a dated construct it's instead of a

00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:26,680
double colon you have to go back to

00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:30,220
England oh that's right you go back to

00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:34,750
Jersey off the coast of Normandy cool

00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:36,849
okay our Canadian here what scalers

00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:46,940
contains the name of your operating

00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:50,209
system Susan Chara that is correct

00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,209
[Applause]

00:42:52,920 --> 00:43:00,010
okay Deidre you're up bonus prize time

00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:04,630
thank you no video just a still you'd

00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:06,370
know what's coming okay the only pearl

00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:08,590
program known to be tattooed on a

00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:12,220
forearm this cryptographic scheme was

00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:18,040
invented in 77 by three MIT graduate

00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:19,600
students Ron patty and Len now I don't

00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:24,220
know who had this tattooed on their form

00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:28,450
I'd be somebody here so what is the name

00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:31,750
of this cryptographic scheme RSA is

00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:34,330
correct we gave you a clue because we

00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:36,190
gave I read the first names and it's

00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:44,160
their last names the initials to their

00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:44,160
last names so cool you already knew good

00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:50,680
okay

00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:54,720
next we're going to the front table here

00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:58,630
and we've got five minutes left

00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:01,870
yeah okay dollar underscore has two

00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:04,570
characters at RV has five this symbol is

00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:06,640
the only single character variable and

00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:09,280
Perl it's a special file handle used to

00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:13,950
speed up calls to stat L stat or eating

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,950
the file tests what is that variable

00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,880
if you've done file IO you've run into

00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,619
there if you've done enough of file

00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:30,029
handling type stuff you've run into this

00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:35,029
if you haven't it'd be a guess which

00:44:30,029 --> 00:44:36,569
letter Delta D is you think it's a :

00:44:35,029 --> 00:44:48,739
nice try

00:44:36,569 --> 00:44:55,170
it is underscore yeah good guess yeah

00:44:48,739 --> 00:44:57,749
it's it's it's actually a file handle um

00:44:55,170 --> 00:45:04,349
we need to we need to throw a prize a

00:44:57,749 --> 00:45:05,670
ton or something I don't know yeah if

00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:08,880
you don't spend enough time with the

00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:10,829
opposite sections spend all the basement

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,420
in your spend all your time in your

00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:13,940
mom's basement then you probably need

00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:19,859
the Battle of sexes game to learn about

00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:24,539
the world okay there we go a mug okay

00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:27,390
next one hex function converts a

00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:31,339
hexadecimal number to a decimal what

00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:31,339
function are use to convert back to hex

00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,689
[Music]

00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:44,100
b-pack actually you use s printf I

00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:52,620
should have clarified this back to a hex

00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:54,510
string okay come up and pick a prize

00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:58,900
[Music]

00:45:54,510 --> 00:46:01,420
okay next one a pragma is like a module

00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,980
you invoke it with use but it affects

00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,320
how perl interpreter program which

00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:14,890
pragma is most likely to speed up the

00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:22,810
typical perl program there is last time

00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:23,200
use faster yeah this is actually tough

00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:29,320
one

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:40,920
the answer is integer come up and pick a

00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:40,920
prize we have to unload these prizes so

00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:52,750
yeah redone no we're not done okay next

00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:58,360
table over here definitions of croak and

00:46:52,750 --> 00:47:01,520
confessor found in which module carb

00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:03,610
that is correct

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:08,630
[Applause]

00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:16,910
okay come up and pick a prize okay the

00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:18,770
lady in the purple shirt sorry I busted

00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:24,110
out laughing when I first I first saw

00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:28,040
this this is great okay here's the the

00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:30,140
question Sara Oh philia cannons hat

00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,600
resides at a National Museum of History

00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:34,880
the Hat with a price tag still attached

00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:38,120
symbolizes canons character at the Grand

00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,150
Old Opry which her character's name is a

00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:45,130
homophone homophone with the little

00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:45,130
program that pearl uses to build itself

00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:51,560
if you knew her name or you knew the the

00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:54,460
the pearl program you would they're the

00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,460
same so

00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:10,320
it has to do the hat with a price tag on

00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:14,070
it

00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:19,330
the answer is mini pearl

00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:21,900
mini pearl come up and get a prize oh we

00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:25,420
have to give her a prize there it is

00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:29,320
there's fun batteries left yeah okay

00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:31,060
next table we've got we've got like 15

00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:39,780
seconds so I guess we're gonna stop here

00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:39,780
and we're gonna jump down to the end and

00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:50,010
okay so put down your pencil let's see

00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,330
here we go

00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:55,840
there you go put down your pencil remove

00:48:52,330 --> 00:49:01,330
your helmet tell your score and if you

00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:04,930
are if you score like this 90 percent

00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:07,359
you're a genius but my high school

00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:10,570
physics class was so hard they had to

00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:17,410
score it a little differently they had

00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:18,700
to score like this yeah and here's where

00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:20,560
we actually got a lot of the questions

00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:26,859
those I don't think any of those still

00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:29,200
exist any of those URLs yeah I kind of

00:49:26,859 --> 00:49:32,320
the problem is this thing has like a

00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,030
hundred and eighty-eight slides so I

00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,470
don't think I can get it to pop up with

00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:37,470
just that one it likes to start over

00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:45,640
yeah let's see if I can get it to go so

00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:50,160
we're actually out of time so thank you

00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:50,160
very much enjoy your prizes

00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,019
