Title: Graham Ollis - "Testing Across The Language Barrier with FFI::Platypus"
Publication date: 2019-06-18
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	This talk is about testing in Perl, Testing (with Test2) and FFI (with FFI::Platypus). At Fastly I work on a component that generates VCL, which gets built as a .so file (dynamic library) which can be called from Perl. I'll be using as an example how I modified the test suite to call into the .so file directly to test the code was generated correctly rather than using regular expressions which were good, but could be fragile and sometimes confused.  I think the technique may have some other applications so I'd like for other Perl developers to see it to help them consider other ways for using Perl and FFI.
