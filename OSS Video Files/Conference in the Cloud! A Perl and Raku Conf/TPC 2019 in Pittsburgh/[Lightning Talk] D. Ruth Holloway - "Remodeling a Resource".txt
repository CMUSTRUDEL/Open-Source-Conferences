good afternoon colleagues I actually had

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,450
something planned in mind and I'm

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,250
actually going to talk about that in a

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,480
minute but first something came up over

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,219
the weekend that really kind of

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,570
irritated me my lightening talk didn't

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,429
really about that but I'm gonna talk

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,590
about it very quickly this article came

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,330
out on open source calm many of you know

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,660
I used to write for open source calm I

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,510
had a column on Perl for awhile I've

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,189
since left I'm not doing that anymore

00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:29,310
but this article came out from a writer

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:32,279
at Red Hat over the weekend banana

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:36,750
listed that excuse me a list of about a

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,030
dozen languages among which is the

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,620
language we're here to talk about I

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,270
found that rather rude and offensive and

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,379
made a comment and said I'm at the

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,000
parole conference in Pittsburgh right

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,989
now and tomorrow I'm going to be giving

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,289
a talk about there are no dead languages

00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:57,620
which I did this morning the poll by the

00:00:52,289 --> 00:01:00,149
way go to this site and stack the deck

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:04,969
when I looked an hour ago Perl was third

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,969
behind C and Pascal we can't have that

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:15,060
right now one of the commenters if you

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,799
read down to the bottom of the page one

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,460
of the commenters who is a former

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,930
keynoter from this conference said she's

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,420
very disappointed in this article that

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,930
was poorly done and and seemed mostly

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,840
there to incite riots which yeah so

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,610
please do go and pester them if you feel

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,729
like it now what my lightning talk is

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,850
really about a few months ago Andy

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,369
Lester posted that the domain name for

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,130
Perl 101 org was going to go away it was

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:47,909
about to expire and he didn't intend to

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,460
keep going and so he said you know if

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,649
nobody's interested well I put in an

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,250
issue on the github and said I'd be

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:59,880
willing to take it over which shortly I

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,049
did I moved it to my own server I thank

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,049
you I spun it back up

00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,670
spinning it back up

00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,170
[Applause]

00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,360
spinning it back up on my server with

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:16,770
the really old CMS that he had built

00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:19,080
around it was non-trivial I think it was

00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,330
built under some really old Perl way

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,610
back when and the brand-new Perl on my

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,220
machine didn't like it terribly well but

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,160
we managed got it up and breathing bugs

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,540
have been found with that but there

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,660
there are some bugs and it's just a

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,750
static site generator what I'm looking

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,720
for is people who are interested in

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,240
making that a valuable resource I have

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,610
some vision I have some ideas I'd like

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,250
to have a lot more content out there not

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:51,440
just about Perl 5 but also Perl 6 Perl 6

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:55,680
mavens in the room is there a Perl 6 101

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:59,220
there can be send me a pull request I'd

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,770
also like to add modules for commonly

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,450
used modules DivX class dancer template

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,330
toolkit lots of other goodies that we

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,190
use a lot catalyst mousse those sorts of

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:11,190
things some basic how do you use this

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,470
stuff I'm gonna wrap it in a little more

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,810
modern content management

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,450
nothing fancy I'm not gonna do some huge

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,060
involved thing the goal is to make it so

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:24,810
that the content is in a separate repo

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,970
from the CMS and to update the content I

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,870
just pull it that's what I want to get

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:34,739
to therefore if you're interested in

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,190
participating in that find me I mean I'm

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,530
not hard to locate in this crowd

00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,840
how many wheelchair operating pink

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,209
haired transgender women are at this

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,610
conference it's not hard to find me

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,050
track me down and and ask how you can

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,920
help if you're interested in writing

00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:55,260
some content I would love to see a pull

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,200
request and my goal is to make it a lot

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,560
that content is in pod fine I have no

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,250
problem with pod like many of us I'm not

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:10,290
fond of writing it but I can write it

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:12,420
markdown flat text HTML god help you

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,829

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:19,079
to send it to me in I am good with that

00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:21,720
my goal is to make it so that the CMS

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,479
will properly ingest whatever I feed it

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,370
and make a coherent output that's the

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,009
goal that's all that CMS is going to do

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,780
is be able to ingest diverse content

00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:32,970
alright so if you're interested in

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,590
contributing to that find me and let's

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,590
