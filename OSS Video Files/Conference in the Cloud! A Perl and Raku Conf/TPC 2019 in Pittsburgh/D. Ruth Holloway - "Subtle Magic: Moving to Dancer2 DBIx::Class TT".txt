Title: D. Ruth Holloway - "Subtle Magic: Moving to Dancer2 DBIx::Class TT"
Publication date: 2019-06-18
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	"Read the documentation", we're told...but there's always more to learn. When I started working with Dancer2, DBIx::Class, and Template Toolkit last fall, I'd seen the basics, but I found out very quickly that there's much more to learn. The capabilities of this stack can influence application design from the ground up--database tables, all the way to the final frameworks you might choose to use on the frontend, and not all of those repercussions are immediately clear from merely reading the documentation!
In this talk, we'll learn about some of the strengths of these modules and demonstrate how their capabilities can be leveraged to help you work faster and write great web-based applications.

okay colleagues let's get started my

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,250
name is Ruth Holloway I've been involved

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,759
in the Perl community for about six

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:18,210
years now I've been writing Perl off and

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:19,140
on for 16 something like we'll talk

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,130
about that in a minute

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,869
a few months ago I changed jobs and I'm

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,340
not just gonna say that it's the best

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,720
place I've ever worked because the

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,500
number two person in the company is

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,059
sitting in the room but it is absolutely

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,840
the best place I've ever worked for a

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:42,090
whole lot of reasons and among them we

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,739
have a technology stack that it didn't

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,750
take me long to get on board with it

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,780
took me a really short time to figure

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,180
out and be producing useful productive

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,640
code quickly so we're going to talk

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,000
about a little bit because if you read

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,219
the docs on these modules well in the

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,230
documentation for template toolkit our

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,290
CEO says looks like it was written in

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:08,580
the 1700s by some monk in Nabby you know

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:11,610
writing with a feather quill their stuff

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:15,270
that's not in the documentation that may

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:19,159
not be obvious to the novice moving to

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,159
these to this stack of applications

00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:24,780
other people's notions of obvious may

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,320
differ from yours

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,740
therefore yeah not always clear

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,540
I started text wrangling we don't know

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:38,310
any languages that are good at data

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:40,530
munging are we a proprietary API for a

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,390
library automation system and their

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,860
scripting language was perl and so

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,020
that's where I started learning Perl and

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,200
I thought that was just the coolest

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,110
thing to be able to manage that data it

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,820
dealt mostly with pipe separated data

00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,920
you'd get these huge feeds of pipe

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,990
separated stuff that you'd then among

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,290
and play with and you'd send back to the

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,880
API pipe delimited stuff to change data

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,350
it was it was great and everybody

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,799
thought it was some kind of wizard

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,259
because I figured all this out no no

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,200
then I worked for several years I got

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,940
out of dealing with propriety

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,129
library automation and started working

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:21,510
with Kohath kohat written in New Zealand

00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:28,769
in 1999 in answer to the y2k problem is

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:30,150
very CGI centric still it's it's a great

00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:32,910
library automation system and they're

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,450
finally starting to make some progress

00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:39,780
to modernize that more but for a long

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:42,239
long time that code base was geared

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,480
toward librarians with a technical bent

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,880
not developers so there were things in

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,630
Perl that you didn't see in there like

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,970
turnery ifs I worked on the koha

00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:58,230
codebase for months before I saw a

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,489
Turner ii-if from anybody and I asked

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,019
and they said well you know some of the

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:02,849
folks that are coding on this are really

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,140
not very good Perl coders and so we're

00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,870
trying to keep it simple

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:11,370
they actually deliberately chose not to

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,840
use some of those idioms in order to

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,930
make it so that more people could

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,430
contribute something that you might

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,549
think about in connection with Sawyer's

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,620
talk this morning the point he didn't

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:26,130
make was we need poor people

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:29,370
contributing to Perl and the way to do

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:32,069
that is to make it so they can and then

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,200
I I spent five years almost six working

00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:39,540
for cPanel platinum sponsor the

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,549
conference Thank You C panel and their

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,950
code base is a 20 year old code base

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:47,250
that was originally written by a

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:51,030
teenager and he still works there

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:53,940
he's the CEO and he's wonderful guy and

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,250
all but you have this massive monolithic

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,530
code base it's huge

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,900
there's a whole bunch of Homer old

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,549
things some of those have turned into

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,870
talks at Pearl conferences about hey

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,900
look at this cool thing we've done and

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,670
we're now releasing it lots and lots of

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,180
custom stuff and they roll their own

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:14,549
thing didn't use a lot of back-end stuff

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,989
that's already available on net a seat

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,859
pan because a lot of it was written

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:23,610
before those modules were there and now

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:26,610
I work for Claire built Claire built is

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,180
a small shop based in Atlanta our CEO

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,130
and CTO

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,110
live just a short distance apart outside

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,280
the city twenty-five-year-old company

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,460
they've been around a long time but this

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:40,080
fall will be 25 years of doing it

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:42,060
they've always stayed small the lots and

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,190
lots and lots of one-off kinds of web

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,780
applications particularly in the

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:50,060
building trades industry there's been

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:53,520
some other focus areas from time to time

00:04:50,060 --> 00:05:02,190
and over half the company is now in the

00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:08,570
room which is really weird to it one row

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:11,729
yeah we're still a small company and

00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,590
still working on a lot of one-off stuff

00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:16,530
we've got customers that have been there

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,599
for years and we're adding new features

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,930
to their applications as they want them

00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:25,199
and so we're maintaining some some kind

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:28,199
of older code bases but good ones and

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,940
and we and I love what we do I have

00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,750
learned things about industries I didn't

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,340
even know existed ten months ago there

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,710
are whole industries that I didn't even

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,780
know we're a thing until I started doing

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:43,770
this job and it has been so much fun to

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:46,260
win to learn all right so our technology

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:50,870
stack the stack that I kind of came into

00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:55,020
and inherited looks like this

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:57,720
Postgres for the data vivix class dancer

00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:03,229
- template toolkit engine ax dev extreme

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:07,169
jquery alright let's look over those

00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:09,210
alright does anybody here not have the

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:12,060
postgrads versus my sequel argument

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,440
settled in their head okay can't help

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,210
you if you hit if you haven't settled

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,690
that argument yet in your head I can't

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,180
help you

00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,009
but postgrads is beautiful for a lot of

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,110
things and one of its propping is if it

00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:25,800
gets into problems it will refuse to do

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,930
anything rather than make mistakes it's

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,280
very conservative about preserving your

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:34,349
data which I find is a nice feature it's

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,669
also not terribly hard to interface with

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:37,669
if you're using Tibbets class

00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,370
vivix class for those who are unfamiliar

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,200
for the one of you that may be

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:52,800
unfamiliar with it is mostly database

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,360
independent and yeah there are database

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,360
engines out there that it won't talk to

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,860
you yet but you know Jeff's here in

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,270
thinking of ideas and so those will be

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,720
fixed by midnight tonight I'm sure

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:08,640
because that's how he rolls in there

00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,110
right Jeff you can do some really

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,940
complicated relational database

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,980
structures in and by the way it's not

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,360
limited to relational databases there

00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,090
are some no sequel things that DivX

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,230
class can now talk to cleanly take a

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,210
look at some of those it's pretty

00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,490
interesting stuff I it makes me scratch

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,520
my head when you start talking about no

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:30,240
sequel and documentary databases I my

00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:35,850
brain bins but DivX class can do some of

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,820
that now but complicated structures in a

00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:42,500
relational database can be really easily

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:45,750
created as coherent saying objects and

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,810
you can output those results you can get

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,480
and and produce those results in lots of

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,080
complex ways pretty much however you

00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,820
need to its pluggable you can add

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,400
helpers and tools and plugins to DivX

00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:04,520
class in order to make things work more

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,520
like you want it it's fantastic for that

00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,290
Matt trout says it this way you're

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,630
supposed to like sequel but it makes it

00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,610
easy to met a program it he wants you to

00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,260
write three lines of Perl while you're

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,330
thinking about the 10 lines of sequel

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,390
that it's going to generate and execute

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,590
and maybe some other things that you

00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:25,670
don't know that it's going to execute

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:28,050
we'll talk about some of those Dancer to

00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,940
add this question before the things

00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,970
started its primary purposes of routing

00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,880
engine for we have applications and it

00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:37,560
takes care of managing the connection

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,120
and managing you know some of the low

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,310
level stuff so you don't have to worry

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,280
about all that it just does it when you

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:48,600
send to get or put or a patch or a

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:50,400
delete request over HTTP then you can

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,690
teach the answer what to do with

00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:57,600
and if it doesn't do them hi Sawyer then

00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:00,020
it does something sane anyway and at

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,580
least we'll give you coherent or

00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,790
somewhat coherent error messages to let

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:09,360
you know where you went wrong there is a

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:12,890
massive plug in infrastructure to do

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,690
common things in dancer authentication

00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:17,460
HTML templating translation and

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,550
localization if you've ever messed with

00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,529
dancer to locale there there are some

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,260
headaches involved in that but they're

00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:29,760
not large ones just one Tylenol sized

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:31,320
headaches and the nice thing is if you

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,980
need a session engine you just plug it

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,839
in and it works done you're finished

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,240
edits um yeah Mille to just to can show

00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,810
how you're configuring things and you're

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,760
good to go

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:46,290
most of the plugins and dancer work on

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,089
that basis and conveniently if you have

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,010
a configuration that is true for all

00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:52,650
instances of this application running

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:56,160
fine you put it in one file and if you

00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:57,810
have settings that are variable based on

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,270
whether I'm in production or development

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:03,630
or staging or testing environments you

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:06,960
can create environment files to just do

00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:10,040
that switching for you and you just spin

00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:14,970
up the one you want and it works

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:16,260
beautifully doing mix type applications

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,930
whether you if you're not generating

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:22,620
HTML but you're looking for something

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:25,410
rusty or ajaxy you can totally do that

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,710
and you can mix them you can mix and

00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,960
match and do all kinds of crazy stuff

00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:33,600
it's it's just nuts easy because you

00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,190
just you tell it what the route is and

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,780
you tell it what you're gonna do as a

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:41,700
code reference and there you go

00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,830
template toolkit as I pointed out

00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,790
earlier it's been around a while

00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:53,089
long long time considering when the docs

00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:55,920
were written it's all written in Perl

00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:59,520
don't let that panic you we know about

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:03,420
that around here you can you can have it

00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,140
ingest PDFs and generate PDFs as well I

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,420
learned that

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,630
recently haven't had much need to do

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,010
that but you can if you're interested in

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,330
learning more about temple toolkit and

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:16,410
seeing those docs I described earlier

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:19,500
there you go there's a link so I wrote a

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,510
little demo out all right the whole app

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,120
that you're gonna see both in a demo now

00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:28,290
and a little more later I spent maybe

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:31,260
two hours on and it is bog ugly I did

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,240
know CSS on it nothing it's just

00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:40,650
straight out of the box running let me

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:42,690
spin that up here okay we have an

00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,450
application here where customers can

00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:48,540
place orders for things they're gonna

00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:50,310
buy stuff and from your company and so

00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:56,670
here's our customer list and this is all

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:58,320
done with template toolkit and I've got

00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,520
some links out here that I can go and do

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,430
stuff and I'm going to create a new

00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,830
order and I'm gonna tell them to ship it

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:08,490
on postal service and they're gonna buy

00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:10,140
two green widgets and I'm gonna submit

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:14,580
the order and then I'm gonna have it go

00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:17,160
to if I remember right and if my app is

00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,650
running yeah it's gonna go there and

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:25,320
then I can view that customer's orders

00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:29,000
there's a couple of orders there alright

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:33,300
less than an hour to get to this point

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,520
less than an hour all right now if I was

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,560
writing a real application for an

00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,200
e-commerce site or a commerce site a

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,990
like a plumbing supply company or

00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,890
something I would spend some time then

00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:49,200
making this beautiful at some point or I

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,940
would tell our UI person I've written

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,400
you an ugly application this should keep

00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,600
you busy for a little while and hand it

00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,980
off to them and and off they go

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,630
but the backend functionality the

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,670
database the structure of the database

00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:05,970
all of that less than an hour and we're

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:08,150
up and working fast you want rapid

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,470
application development there you go and

00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:14,190
there's you know four or five routes in

00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:15,960
here nothing complicated you could view

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,180
customers you can be ordered view all

00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,740
orders so we could you know

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,700
button here show all the orders well

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,630
there's only one customer in the

00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,040
database let's let's add a customer I

00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:33,210
added a big ol ugly plus button over

00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:33,810
here have you ever tried to type on one

00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,529
of these lockers

00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,529
it's crazy

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,350
and since we're in Pennsylvania

00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:06,749
less than an hour it's up and running

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:07,949
works time let me switch back now when

00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:10,110
you're writing this kind of thing

00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:13,559
there's some some thoughts you might

00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:17,790
want to take into consideration and how

00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:19,170
you design your database matters now we

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,569
would like to say as application

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,970
developers it always matters anyway but

00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:26,160
just some fine bits that you might bump

00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:28,230
into that work really well in this stack

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,790
if you don't in your table names with s

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,559
you'll get some free accessor zal it'll

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,439
later I'll show you that it's pretty

00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:36,990
cool using second normal or third normal

00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:38,819
form works really really well for dance

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,319
turned DivX class especially the Dybbuk

00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:42,990
class stuff really cares about that it

00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:45,449
creates nice coherent objects that way

00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:49,559
you don't have some insane connection

00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:50,999
and if you're creating table names with

00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:53,339
multiple words just use underscores

00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:56,730
between the words and I'll show you why

00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:58,800
in just a minute or to you there's some

00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:02,180
automatic tools for creating your schema

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,649
if you don't like hand hacking schema

00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,089
just create the database however you

00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:07,500
want the database to look and then run

00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:12,680
this tool and it'll just create all the

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:16,259
schema files for you use that it I can't

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:21,059
preach how ugly a schema file can look

00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:22,860
without it homely as sin but this

00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:24,480
automated thing and by the way it

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,550
conveniently leaves you some space at

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,170
the bottom to add custom things you

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,699
might need for your application business

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:33,000
logic or other things that you might

00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:34,589
want to add to the schema custom

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,500
accessories you got it no problem

00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:39,389
there's a spot for it it reserves you a

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,939
place for your work and if you recreate

00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:45,360
the schema it'll preserve that work if

00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:47,100
you put it in the right place result set

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,660
names are the camel cased version of the

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,600
table name if you've used underscores

00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:54,809
and words and use that generator there

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,259
you go you've got these nice clean table

00:15:54,809 --> 00:16:00,029
names that read very well find in search

00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:04,220
if you do a finder a search you get

00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:08,059
accessor z' for related objects for free

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,059
for free asterisk

00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:13,150
it doesn't actually fetch from that

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,570
other table until you try to access it

00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:18,520
but it sets up the accessor for you so

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,920
if you do customer and it's tied to

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,370
address it doesn't fetch the address

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,890
until you try to read the address till

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:30,520
you try to get the values so if you use

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:32,530
prefetch and join you use join if your

00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,740
logic requires that if you only want

00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:37,630
customers from Pennsylvania say and you

00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,210
can use prefetch for I don't care what's

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:42,550
in there just get it I want to use it

00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,960
because I'm gonna print it out then that

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:46,600
saves database queries if you have a

00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:50,970
thousand customers and there's a related

00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:54,040
table for addresses and then you try to

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,750
print out like that address table it's

00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,400
going to do one query to get the

00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,750
thousand customers and then one query

00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,260
for each one of them to get their

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:05,490
addresses not efficient do a pre fetch

00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:08,020
and it gets it all one database query

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,730
and since your database query probably

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,750
means disk i/o and what's the slowest

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:17,050
thing in computing IO it's gonna speed

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:19,570
things up really rapidly to do that if

00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:23,110
you do it same length you don't always

00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:27,490
need to fetch everything don't fetch all

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:30,010
the things you don't need accessing

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,720
objects is then really easy if it's a

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:36,010
one to one relationship like an order

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:38,290
show me the customer for this order if I

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,790
have many line items on an order and I

00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,430
want to get a list of them this is why

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,440
you don't in your table names in s

00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:46,930
because this comes for free if you use

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,990
the auto generator and haven't put a

00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:52,060
table name that ends in S I'm not sure

00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:55,030
what it does if you do I haven't tried

00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:57,100
that but I suspect there's pain and

00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:01,510
suffering involved somewhere in there or

00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:07,750
bad English at the very least alright

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:10,660
this makes it really really easy free

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:13,060
wrote some helpers a while back

00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:17,860
Matt trout pointed me at this repository

00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:19,390
on Sipan and I got lost for some hours

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,670
just looking at all the great treasures

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,970
that are in there some of them went oh

00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,740
my

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,420
I would never use the hat what was I

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,580
what was that for

00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,800
but and some of them are simply

00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,620
syntactic sugar they're just there to

00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,930
make things look nice but some of them

00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,750
are pretty useful there's some result

00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:40,420
set formatting tricks there's date

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:43,510
handlers so if you're dealing with dates

00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:47,880
coming back and forth random row results

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:50,170
what would that be useful for testing

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,760
you want random something out of the

00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:55,210
table so you can test things there you

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:58,950
go one of the things the DivX class

00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:02,080
doesn't do much of on its own is

00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:05,500
exceptions if you're using exception

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:09,150
handling adding this helper can help you

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,710
throw those exceptions upstream better

00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:15,130
and if we're done and explained on a DB

00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,860
query yeah well how about having Perl do

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:19,960
that for you freeze helpers have that

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,400
there's a whole bunch spend an hour some

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,170
time just looking through this and going

00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,000
I could use that oh I've never used that

00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,140
well that'd be useful you might find

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,400
good bits in there and they're all

00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:34,530
really easy to set up and use helpers

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:37,210
should be helpful yeah

00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,920
so the date of the data binding if you

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,110
send this stuff out to template toolkit

00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:47,290
in Perl here I'm going to do a get of my

00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:49,150
customers I'm gonna grab my customers

00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,310
and I'm gonna search the whole data set

00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,560
that's why the open closed brace like

00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:56,830
that and I told it to prefetch my

00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:59,110
addresses so I can get my customers and

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:02,410
all of their addresses one query on the

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:05,080
database done regardless of the size of

00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:08,490
my database at this point because I

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:11,350
don't have gazillions of Records and

00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:15,510
then I send it to a template and I send

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:20,020
my customers as the name customers

00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:22,480
clever huh but you could call that left

00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:25,270
term the left-hand side of that anything

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,130
you wanted because you're creating a

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:31,990
variable name that you can then use in

00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:34,180
template toolkit like so for each

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,380
customer in customers print their ID

00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,010
their name

00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:42,400
and if they have an address you want to

00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:44,950
check for undef here we've bumped into

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,780
that one a few times where we're not

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,150
checking for defining nests at this

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,730
point if your table doesn't require that

00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,620
a customer have an address then you

00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:57,760
might have put one in without it it's a

00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:01,840
good idea to check for it and it's that

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,789
simple now you might notice on state

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:09,929
that's actually a reference to another

00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:09,929
table so the problem with this is what

00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:22,179
but I totally should have and the way to

00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:24,460
do that the prefetch turns into an array

00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:28,210
so you square bracket it and the first

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:34,000
term is address like you see there that

00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:35,230
right arrow state you've got it and you

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,960
don't even have to make that one right

00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,090
you just because you're always you're

00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,210
still only fetching one relationship

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:46,090
which is tiered it's not hard you can

00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:48,250
chain those multiple joins together very

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:51,700
easily you can join to the same table

00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:57,280
twice if you want to which is a little

00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:59,950
crazy but you can do that but that is so

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,210
old-school and do I get points for using

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:05,650
this picture and I'm in a modern

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:07,450
presentation you know how many of you

00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:11,490
remember dressing like this and we'll

00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:14,980
admit it okay I see some hands down low

00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:18,909
I'm with you on that why not yeah yeah

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:21,520
that's when I grew up modern browsers

00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:24,789
can do a lot of the work for you they're

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,909
a lot more competent I remember in CS a

00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:30,970
mosaic and the browser was dumb as a

00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:32,620
post it couldn't do a whole lot on its

00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,090
own and if you didn't have fonts loaded

00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,429
well you got everything in Times New

00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,620
Roman whether you wanted it or not it

00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:42,059
was like a Model T can have it in one

00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,059
font as long as it's Times New Roman

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,580
there's a huge variety of user

00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:52,450
environments layout tool

00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:55,089
web frameworks you name it and in fact

00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,649
many companies spend a great deal of

00:22:55,089 --> 00:23:00,509
time bickering and arguing and

00:22:56,649 --> 00:23:03,219
discussing and deciding which one to use

00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:03,729
there are many many of them take your

00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:06,879
pick

00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:08,320
well once you get that pick fine why

00:23:06,879 --> 00:23:12,190
don't you send some of the work to the

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:15,940
browser's let the cloud is just somebody

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:17,349
else's computer all you're doing is

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,179
downloading some of the work to the

00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:20,169
users computer they're the one asking

00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:25,019
for stuff anyway

00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:28,329
let them do some of the work so jQuery

00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:31,779
the most deployed JavaScript library on

00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:35,109
the Internet by a huge margin for good

00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:37,089
or ill there are some who will say that

00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:39,070
is a great thing it means a huge user

00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:40,059
base of support there are some who say

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,469
oh my god

00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:46,089
I can't believe this thing is a success

00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:48,700
because it's painful or whatever you

00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:51,219
know fine but it's feature-rich and it

00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:54,249
simplifies a lot of things it does some

00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:57,519
things pretty easily that that look nice

00:23:54,249 --> 00:24:01,089
and work well but mostly it stays

00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:03,070
invisible to the users you don't there

00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:05,619
are some some UI elements that you can

00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:10,179
use but but it's it's intended for the

00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:11,739
backend we use dev extreme it's a

00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:14,019
product of DevExpress it's a component

00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:18,149
suite providing a whole mess of UI

00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:21,969
components beautiful beautiful grids

00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:24,519
charting tools schedulers editing tools

00:24:21,969 --> 00:24:28,059
maps a whole lot more you can get out of

00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:30,940
this thing one of our common use cases

00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:33,700
is a grid you've got a grid full of data

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:37,089
a table and you want to export that

00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:39,690
table to excel you want to allow the

00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:43,959
user to export that table to excel

00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:47,589
one-line and it adds a button and they

00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:50,379
click it and it just works one line so

00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:53,649
all of that you don't need a library to

00:24:50,379 --> 00:24:55,899
write to create excel files you don't

00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:59,559
it's all there and it's all in the

00:24:55,899 --> 00:25:02,010
browser end the back end in Perl doesn't

00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:05,940
even know that happened and doesn't care

00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,940
click a button you download

00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:11,740
it's very Ajax friendly so if you want

00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:13,690
dynamic changes to things you can

00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,740
totally do that and have it communicate

00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:20,620
with it with dancer in Ajax very easily

00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:23,230
it integrates well with jQuery and it

00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:27,789
also works with reactive UAS Pia ionic

00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:30,010
and lots of others and on their website

00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:33,059
on their documentation they have lots of

00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:36,909
examples in lots of different flavors of

00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:39,190
frameworks so take a pic it is a

00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:42,070
proprietary product but it is free for

00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:44,470
open source projects so think about what

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:46,149
you're working on and really I've looked

00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:49,480
at their license it's not terribly

00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:51,179
expensive if you're doing something big

00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,950
that's gonna make you a bunch of money

00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:57,610
it's not a high price it's not

00:25:53,950 --> 00:26:01,059
outrageous so worth looking into and I

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:03,549
found it incredibly easy to use you know

00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:05,380
when I came on I'm like ok I've done

00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:07,809
about ten lines of JavaScript in my

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,429
career I'm really not very good at

00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:11,950
JavaScript and my first experience with

00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:14,350
JavaScript also involved angular and

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:15,909
then there was much pain and suffering

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:19,169
and crying and gnashing of teeth and

00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:23,380
many many tylenol involved in that and

00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:25,000
and I I just I was averse to dealing

00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,590
with that because I just didn't want to

00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,960
do it all right

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:33,909
but using debit stream and jQuery I was

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:36,940
able to create useful marginally

00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:40,330
beautiful not perfect but marginally

00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:43,299
good user interfaces quickly and easily

00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:47,590
on my own didn't need a lot of help

00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:51,750
after the first month or so you don't

00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:51,750
see that I can show you a thing or two

00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:59,169
thank you for the judgey faces I

00:26:54,250 --> 00:27:02,260
appreciate that yep good all right so I

00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:04,899
created this this customer list I

00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:10,059
created it using a dev Xtreme grid just

00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:11,620
to show the difference there it is it's

00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:13,419
the same list now I want to add a

00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:16,260
customer and I have this beautiful

00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:21,150
pop-up for

00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:21,150
isn't it gorgeous well it sad

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,040
there

00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:49,640
it's all done with Ajax it's backed up

00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:51,890
it's it's updated the backend reloaded

00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,310
the grid but not the whole page did that

00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:57,890
in about 30-40 minutes after I had the

00:27:55,310 --> 00:28:00,620
base application running and just hooked

00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,220
it into this menu pretty straightforward

00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,250
huh

00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:10,400
and it looks nice it looks way nicer

00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:12,290
than this wouldn't you think is it the

00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,270
most beautiful that's a subjective

00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:17,030
judgment I am not qualified to make I

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:22,730
don't work in the fashion industry I'm a

00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:25,280
developer but I like working with dev

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:28,310
extreme okay so every element of our

00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:31,430
stack from postgrads all the way to dev

00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:34,010
extreme every piece of this I have found

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:37,550
easier to use than any code I've written

00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:40,090
before I found that I get better results

00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:44,330
than any codebase I've worked on before

00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:48,130
and I'm doing it faster than I've ever

00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:50,390
done it before all right my first

00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:54,380
project with the company which I did as

00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:58,070
a consultant was to generate a whole new

00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:02,840
feature for managing for document

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:05,030
management for an auto leasing lending

00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,580
organization that landed money for auto

00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:08,840
purchases and they needed to ship titles

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,100
around and they needed package

00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,470
management to know because they would

00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:16,010
ship from the auctions huge bundles of

00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:19,040
titles that go to several dealers and

00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:21,110
there's all this complexity well the

00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:24,950
estimate was that that would take 24 is

00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:29,420
showers I turned it in 19 we found a bug

00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:31,010
it took me one hour to fix it done my

00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,330
second project as soon as I came full

00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,340
time for the company because as soon as

00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,420
I turned that in literally the same day

00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,660
I was said do you want to work full-time

00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:40,250
for us sure literally that day I was

00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:44,830
asked if I wanted to work full-time and

00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:47,510
I said yes I do let's make that happen

00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:49,580
my first project was to migrate a site

00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:53,240
the last remaining site with the company

00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:58,050
from dancer - dancer - estimated 40

00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:00,090
hours I turned it in in 10 done

00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,010
and if we had a bug come up and related

00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:06,900
to that yet I don't think so I haven't

00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:09,059
seen one I'm riding better faster

00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:12,030
prettier code easier to maintain code

00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:15,590
then I have ever written in my 30 plus

00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:18,240
year professional career with this stack

00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,860
so you know especially if you're looking

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,440
for some open source project that you're

00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,300
working on you're looking for a

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,790
technology stack to build it on give

00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:31,710
this a thought because you've you've got

00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:33,840
a lot of wins to have there you want a

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:36,870
hack on this code that I've done here it

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:41,730
is it's at my github account geek rosy

00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:43,230
subtle magic yeah I see some people

00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:47,490
taking pictures that's fine take a

00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:50,030
picture of the slide if you aren't that

00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:54,000
base application is there including

00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:56,130
including some a sequel script to create

00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,080
the database tables all the bits you'll

00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:00,080
need to spin it up and get it running

00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,790
you know I probably could talk about

00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,410
this kind of stuff a whole lot more I

00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:13,070
could talk about how much I love my job

00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:24,980
all day long and frequently do as my

00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:26,780
boss will tell you but questions it's

00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:31,460
really way more brainless than you think

00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:32,570
it might be yeah could I could I talk

00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:36,040
about the experience of going from

00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:38,929
dancer - dancer - and what that involved

00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,450
mostly it was a look for a used dancer

00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:43,760
and said it and change it to use dancer

00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:49,640
- and then pull the crank and see what

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:52,520
happened and not much broke because the

00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,260
dancer community cleverly has written a

00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,390
whole lot of modules in dancer - that

00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:58,580
also existed in dancer one and they just

00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:02,630
work the thing that I had the problem

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:05,210
with was that on my development box

00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:07,580
I had the dancer ones installed but not

00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:10,549
the dance tutus installed for a few

00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:13,520
modules once I got the modules in place

00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:18,559
done it really wasn't that hard there

00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:19,580
were minor minor differences in the

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,710
appscript

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:25,100
to actually run the thing to actually

00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:26,480
start dancing that changed there were

00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,809
some changes there but it their minor

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,299
it's it is small there's actually is

00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:35,380
there still a document in and CPN on

00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:39,950
doing that migration that's what I used

00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:42,679
yeah and it was easy it really is a one

00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,059
line set script in a lot of ways just

00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:47,390
run a set script against your code base

00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:50,419
and then pull the handle and pray and

00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:52,540
most things are gonna work if you've got

00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:56,150
the modules deployed you're good to go I

00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:59,929
ran some some greps for use use dancer :

00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:01,549
: use dancer 2 : : and make sure I had

00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:02,750
all the modules that was the biggest

00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:05,809
part for me that's where I spent the

00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:08,870
most of that 10 hours literally it was

00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:10,460
it was a no-brainer so if you've got

00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:12,650
older dancer apps

00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,830
it is totally doable and it is totally

00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,830
easy

00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:20,230
all right any other questions I'm

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,550
surprised no one's asked the question I

00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:31,840
thought of are you hiring talk to us

00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:34,210
because the answer is maybe all right

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:39,610
well I'm I am I'm literally out of

00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:41,740
content I'm out I would love to I I

00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:45,340
thank you for your time I appreciate you

00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:46,930
being here go in peace with my wishes

00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:50,160
best wishes for you and those you love

00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:50,160
