	00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:12,929
so I gave this talk at Yap C 2001 yeah

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:16,590
because uh I had a I also have some

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:19,619
talks from ninety nine and nineteen 100

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,359
but this one I thought was probably more

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,689
interesting the other two were about

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,660
Mack pearl this one is about slash which

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:31,050
is the code that runs slash dot alright

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,600
so uh who I was this isn't really who I

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,180
hand this is who I was I was on the

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,010
slash core team at slash dot I was the

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,629
maintainer of Mack pearl I wrote the

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,360
Pearl news column in the Pearl Journal

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:50,010
and I ran use pearl which was a pearl

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:53,699
site that ran the slash code and so

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:56,789
slash it started out as chips and dips

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:59,250
that was a slash dots first incarnation

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,050
and eventually soon after that they

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,120
changed the name slash dot they were

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:07,590
bought by and over net which is when I

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:11,610
joined which was around 2000 he had

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:15,180
January 2000 I think we open sourced the

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:18,869
code trying to balance community needs

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,090
in the slash needs then VA Linux bought

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,650
and over net and shade in and over to

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:28,439
Annette became OS DN which included

00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:32,729
fresh meat SourceForge thinkgeek slash

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,710
dot Linux calm so uh this is probably

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,229
the most interesting part here this is

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,439
the first version of the function called

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:44,369
pol booth this is a before I got there

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:49,790
so some things to notice DBH right here

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:52,799
that's a global we have our you know

00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:57,799
sequel right there just above our

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,799
printing of yeah

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:12,879
it's it's it's really bad so yeah yeah

00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:14,739
oh yeah sorry guys um so then we when I

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,500
first got there we did some cleanup we

00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:19,390
got rid of some Global's we create I

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,730
created this thing called just is dollar

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,019
capital I and that's like you know we're

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,910
not gonna use Global's but we still is

00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:26,200
gonna take awhile so we took these

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,170
Global's and we put them in this global

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,030
hash and access them that way instead

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,319
cleaned things up we added this thing

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,209
right here stripped by mode that's to

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,849
actually protect data so we're not just

00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,620
you know shooting ourselves in the foot

00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:40,959
or allowing our users to shoot us in the

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,500
foot which they tried to do often so we

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,660
cleaned it up we had you know change the

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,540
sequel function so things were more

00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,650
modular and then we're like okay now

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,400
we've cleaned it up now let's actually

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:59,950
make it good so you know no more

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,989
Global's we get the current database we

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,600
put the display layer it used template

00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:05,980
toolkit and slash display did the the

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,299
toolkit stuff which was really cool we

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,450
actually stored our templates in the

00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:13,000
database and I wrote a template tool kit

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,620
provider layer to pull the right

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,889
template out of the database and cache

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,239
it it would compile it because uh those

00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:20,739
of you do use template toolkit you know

00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,510
you can actually compile those templates

00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:25,359
that compiled a Perl code so we compile

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:29,650
it cache it everything would be in the

00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:31,359
database there and we also had cool

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:37,690
stuff where we could actually call our

00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:39,900
slash API from inside a template this is

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,609
all just you know here's how you make

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:47,560
old code not suck so much

00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:51,910
that's all that's talking about let's

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,190
see let's go ahead here oh yeah here's

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,810
an example template right so this is

00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,579
template toolkit stuff you can see right

00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,160
here like we can actually call like any

00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:02,049
of our database methods get new stories

00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,519
get section from right inside the

00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:09,310
template we also module rised the

00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,360
database calls because we had users

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,750
because we had open source we had

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,820
usually want to use Postgres we use

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,790
sequal something you want to use Oracle

00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:20,630
so we took a lot of the my sequel isms

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:22,460
out and we did a lot of really cool

00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,350
stuff and I don't know what my time

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,460
looks like but I know that I'm probably

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:29,660
at least halfway done so we also had

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,260
some stuff about installing because

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:36,110
again we had external users so so we

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,220
made installation easier eventually you

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:41,510
know fast forward several years from

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,250
this eventually we didn't have much of a

00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,169
user base and we stopped pushing out

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,710
updates to it but it was fun while it

00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:47,590
lasted

00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:55,360
thank you

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:55,360
