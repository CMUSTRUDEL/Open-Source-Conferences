Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	Reducing Business Risk Using Perl described both "why Perl" (aimed at managers) and "how to use Perl" (aimed at engineers).  The material is very dated now, and even included references to the Bill Clinton scandal.

well I've been coming to you AB C for a

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:08,160
long time a long time when Jim talked to

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,550
me yesterday about what this session was

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,830
cuz I missed the morning talk he said do

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,619
you still happen to have the slide deck

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,990
that you presented at the app see the

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,609
first one the absolutely in 99 and I

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,980
said I think so but I think it's in

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,250
frame maker and framing is long gone on

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,429
the Mac but I just luckily had produced

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,160
a set of PDFs as a backup so that's what

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,950
I'm presenting now so this is a talk I

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,050
gave at the op C 1989 the very first one

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,010
it says a very short course which is

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,379
actually quite long I'm going to be

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,530
editing it as we speak and it was

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,230
basically about reducing business risk

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,670
using Perl so and do I mean use it Perl

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,739
instead of other things or use pearl

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,539
correctly and the answer was yes so

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,100
there's two halves to this talk first is

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,390
why Perl and that's meant for managers

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,219
to select Perl instead of other

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,559
languages and the second half was how

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,050
Perl think of it as pro best practices

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,239
before Demian wrote his book and we're

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,790
gonna see now after 20 years how many of

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,150
those are out of date this is pretty

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,799
remarkable okay so this is all some

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,060
common stuff I like this so because I

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,409
actually took the client list

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,720
that Stonehenge had while we're doing

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,460
all our trainings and consulting and it

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,040
was a quite a list of repressive people

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,990
for that tense little names there and

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,299
this is all stuff we all know so I'll

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,189
just skip over that too and at this

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,600
point only learning Perl second edition

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,700
and learning Perl and 132 systems

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,140
existed and the funny part is when

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,210
people learning parole when third you

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,710
came out people asked me how is it

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,750
different from learning Perl and I said

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,009
I don't know I wrote the parts that were

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,470
the same not the parts that are

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:44,189
different Erik Olson wrote all those

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,110
back so and again this is all stuff we

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,750
know and no I don't need to explain this

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,700
code you all know what this is yeah this

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,829
is all just basically you know what is

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,079
Perl to try to teach managers that this

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,820
is a reasonable thing to have and give

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,290
them kind of an overview at their level

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,229
so that's what the original title of the

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,880
talk was meaning

00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,640
and there are some good books and good

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:09,619
courses but here's the part where it

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:12,380
gets fun first slide y2k remember

00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:16,730
remember that first year was 1999 this

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:18,890
was a problem right yeah exactly just to

00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,170
make up fun of this slide yes exactly

00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,850
and then now this slides obviously

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,459
broken too you don't this was just say

00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,200
don't use pearl for anymore but now it's

00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:32,030
completely broken because we have pearl

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,069
6 uh-huh CGI p.m. remember that at least

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,080
it was better than CGI IPL which is the

00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:37,430
whole point of this slide and then of

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,680
course use the function imports not the

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,959
object interface reduce duplicated code

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,580
by putting it into subroutines keep your

00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,010
global variable user to a minimum

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:50,090
obviously you know this is this is best

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:53,180
practices on a very small scale warnings

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:57,440
to - W remember that when we did that

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,269
everywhere right not use warnings flock

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,750
your files so you don't don't do double

00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:05,450
writes o member dot PHP files Oh does

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,489
this go back does this go away back

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,690
remember sis slash socket duck Beach

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:12,260
release has been programming for 20

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,150
years in Perl yeah and there's also the

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,780
right modules in ident right you socket

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:20,900
or use I Osaka dinette and so on but if

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,220
you're just talking mail read on now

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,600
I've got to remind you what was

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:30,049
happening in the u.s. at 1999 I'll just

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,489
say Clinton okay so I wrote this as an

00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:33,410
example it says I don't know if you can

00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:36,680
read that but it's mail from president

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,209
at not so White House gov and the body

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,450
the message is I resign effectively

00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:43,040
immediately amazing how times have

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,350
changed

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,490
[Music]

00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,360
just if we could only get them to send

00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,840
this mail right

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,520
I always check return values

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,950
totally dead child children fighting

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,390
about I really had a double-take about

00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,190
whether I was believing that to Tyler

00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,640
but it's literal I mean it's really what

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,160
I mean right

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,730
don't leave Zombies document your code

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,530
pod all that sort of stuff use debugging

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,850
controlled by a global variable that way

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,410
you can enable/disable of course now I

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,470
already use log and things like that

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:16,020
instead and Perl style for additional

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,730
ideas and then remember we're all

00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,200
worried about teen stuff because it was

00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,710
all about when you're getting values in

00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,090
on the web and of course that's all I

00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,260
don't know anybody even uses taint mode

00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,900
anymore anywhere it's anybody still

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,160
using in any app so if you got ok a

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,180
couple couple over there in the corner

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,600
that's where they're back in the corner

00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,160
alright so I talked about the actions

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,850
that were dangerous one state mode is

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,020
enabled and I asked about I consult

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,990
about how to get around some of those

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,760
and here was the one this one has

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,990
another Clinton reference no need for

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,060
shells the launched children notice down

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:54,210
in the search for search for Monica yeah

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:56,970
1999 remember remember also try to code

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,370
to avoid the shell if you can you can

00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,100
code to avoid forking by using built-ins

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,010
to talk to I'll get DNS lookups and

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,290
things like that and hidden fields

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,790
aren't so hidden really don't put

00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,830
sensitive data in the get URL these are

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,630
all common web things now but you know

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,790
that's kind of what Perl was heavily

00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,320
used for back then don't kind of refer

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,760
which to their footnote I know you can't

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,380
see the footnote says it's not even

00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,070
spelled right

00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,960
so I can't count on that at all and set

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,750
your own path if you're working in a CGI

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,980
environment things like that and they

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:34,110
used to be username you know don't use

00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,590
bin mail to send mail use a valid return

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,490
address when sending mail and how to

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,660
write standard error let's see if

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,700
there's anything it's throw away bad

00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,390
books now I had an investment in this

00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,770
slide so there are some scary books out

00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,110
there be sure to check the reviews some

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,120
books have typos some typos are so bad

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,940
the programs wouldn't even compile there

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,680
was that really thick book of parole in

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,470
a weekend or something there's some big

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,910
thick book me broke yes anyway good

00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,380
support for advanced technology and

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,970
here's a bunch of URLs half of which

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,160
don't work anymore that's kind of that

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:08,370
way and that game was for my first topic

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,620
okay good yeah okay all right so the

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,540
second part of the talk again Jim

00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,730
suggested this talk is the one I wanted

00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,590
to bring out Jim also suggested the next

00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:19,890
thing I'm about to do for those of you

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,030
that went to the 2004 as if it pull us

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,930
out so I'm gonna close to my speaker

00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:29,370
labels were cranked up for those who

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,750
went to the the Yap seat in Buffalo you

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,270
notice that I wasn't there I was

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,980
actually there at Jim's location the

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,200
University of Buffalo University at

00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:40,920
Buffalo sorry he's gonna kill me if I

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:45,720
don't say it that way yeah I had to get

00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:47,610
my had to learn that real quick he's so

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,100
so anyway so we decided it since we were

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,630
together before the conference that we

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,580
would make a little video and some of

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,580
you have seen this but I'm gonna play it

00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:01,180
sorry operator

00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:19,590
faster this

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:32,990
Hey order food okay Michael that's

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,730
alright you know we got going on today

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:39,890
I'm going to install the supposed to

00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:41,300
this game I don't know this is soccer

00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,100
for the rest of us I don't even know

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:49,510
what does I just no longer it wants me

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:49,510
to get installed over him I see you

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,339
hi Peter how's it go you know you've got

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:03,059
the new Festivus software you know we

00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:03,869
need that installed by Tuesday without

00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:05,879
the okay

00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:08,129
yeah I did well I just got it this

00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,789
morning right you know but you

00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:13,129
understand that it's important for our

00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:15,419
productivity to have an install by

00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:16,909
Tuesday have we talked about last week

00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,069
you said that it had to be right all

00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:21,180
right very good

00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,740
yeah Bill you notice I was looking at

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,330
the software and I noticed that I need

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,449
some more permissions if I'm gonna

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,550
install this on a server oh right you'll

00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:32,279
need to take care of that by calling

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,250
Nick I'm sure you're familiar with Nick

configuration it's exactly like what

00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:59,120
they say in the book but it's all these

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,679
areas the thing just went wrong I don't

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,029

be the only one having problems with

00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,660
this what you would do a search on

00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,980
internet seafood and you know that's

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,649
probably a good idea I've been staring

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,620

00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:14,240

internet so I'm checking that out that

00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,970
looks good

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,499
well it turns out bunch of people have

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,600
written like plugins to solve these

00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:39,860
problems in Perl you ever I've never

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,869
used a Perl before it I'm not really

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,759
sure I think you've heard of it isn't

00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:47,269
just a scripting language I don't know

00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,350
but I'm not gonna try it out yeah you

00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:50,660
better you got to figure out something

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,339
soon Bloomberg is gonna be a few yeah I

00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:58,249
know I just hope I don't have to call

00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:59,809
Nick all right later which dimwits

00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:03,049
friend's got a buffer overflow this time

00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:04,549
oh hey yeah I said to give you a call

00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:07,249
you know I'm still working on this

00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:09,049
bestest thing and I tried to import some

00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:10,519
Perl scripts that'd be amazing if they

00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:12,160
worked importing in the Perl I think you

00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,079
need a double loop from the sea pen oh

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,269
right yeah well yeah that's what I meant

00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:19,879
and I actually did I downloaded a few

00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:21,379
things from the sea pan but when I try

00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:26,959
to want it like it does pearl my found

00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:28,519
serious begging line properly poured but

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,079
everybody knows that version five six

00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:34,809
forty five point in our binary content

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,809
oh I think you need users of the bin /

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,960
[Music]

00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,440
[Music]

00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:38,899
hey Pierre what's happening okay though

00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,300
you know I'm here some things about you

00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:44,179
working on this parole thing instead of

00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,769
Festivus what's going on oh yeah

00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:47,749
actually I downloaded some amount of

00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:49,910
modules and run the internet now that I

00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:52,550
can great move down but I'm going to

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,709
have to disagree with you there because

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:58,009
we got to check legal before downloading

00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:59,660
anything yeah you know I read all of the

00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:01,249
release notes and all the modules and

00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,170
it's all open source so I think we're

00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:05,540
okay they're billing be a problem but

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,119
it's not approved by the company

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:11,449
politics system we are going to only use

00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:14,000
Java JavaScript and anything that starts

00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:16,579

we did that job at raining money they

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:26,839
seemed pretty easy nah I think I'm just

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,430
