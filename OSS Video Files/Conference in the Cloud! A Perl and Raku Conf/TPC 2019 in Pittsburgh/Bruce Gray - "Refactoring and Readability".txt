Description: 
	Refactoring is:
- worth practicing as a discrete skill
- bound to an implied value judgement of "better" code
- best served with a separate commit workflow
- unsafe without automated testing
Readability is:
- crucial to code quality
- best achieved by "switching hats" during refactoring
- to be prioritized over premature optimization.
- beneficial to more than just technical debt
