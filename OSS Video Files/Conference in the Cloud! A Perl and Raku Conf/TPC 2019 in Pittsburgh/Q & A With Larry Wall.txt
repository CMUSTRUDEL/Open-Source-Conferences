we're gonna get started now so thanks

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,450
everyone for coming back from lunch

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:08,880
promptly as you can see from the

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,010
schedule this is the portion of the

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,139
conference where we get to do a question

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,519
and answer session with Larry wall so

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,150
those of you who have made it to this

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,010
point of the conference and don't know

00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:23,670
Larry wall is the author of many things

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:26,519
the patch program Perl in many

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,050
incarnations including profile still in

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,260
active use author of many books

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,020
including a Perl programming the the

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,460
camel book and everyone knows well troll

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:41,129
cookbook as well as a co-author on that

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,570
no he got credit for it I helped all

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,219
right well that's the way it is with all

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,989
these with all the same yeah alright

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,360
fair enough

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,160
also some facts I did not know Thank You

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,350
Wikipedia the winner of the

00:00:50,160 --> 00:01:01,320
International obfuscated cheat code

00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:05,010
contest twice twice yeah that was prep

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,130
for parole yeah and also winner of the

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,650
first Free Software Foundation Award for

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:17,670
the advancement of free software in 1998

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:20,130
so excellent and and one one other

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,479
interesting tidbit that you read as

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,759
you're preparing for this is he's known

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,810
for his wit and sarcastic humor which

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,659
may come I feel good when you're going

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,720
to be I'm gonna be standing here asking

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:40,729
questions so as we get started there if

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:40,729
you have a question for Larry and also

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:47,399
the battery in and out oh there we go

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,680
and if you include ask Larry on there so

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,000
if you tweet to those two hashtags then

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,780
we'll see the tweets and we can get the

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,820
questions alright yeah

00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,610
so let's get started actually with some

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,150
questions that we got through Twitter

00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:06,500
from some of the folks at the conference

00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:15,380
when your kid what did you want to be

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:16,940
when you grow up well I said I wanted to

00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:33,850
be a missionary but I had no idea what

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:35,959
that man couple couple years ago they

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,800
they asked me what I'd done would have

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,940
done if I hadn't done Perl and at the

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,950
time I said well maybe I would be a

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,020
professional golfer gancho

00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,760
I actually think that if I had not been

00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,350
oh you know that had been computers I

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,459
probably would have ended up a conductor

00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:54,560
of an orchestra okay I like I like

00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,630
playing an orchestra like an instrument

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,770
so that's a good lead-in to one of the

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,739
other questions we got who is your

00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:08,239
favorite musical composer and why let's

00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:11,540
swap smaller smaller fans oh yeah I

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,030
played in Seattle Youth Symphony I

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,630
played Mahler's fifth and Muller's tenth

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,650
ayat we actually did twice most dentists

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,080
famous because we actually never

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:24,110
finished it except in one store and it

00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,799
was finished by one of those acolytes

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:30,530
that Derek cooked but it's the reason I

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,519
like Mahler's is because well you kind

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:36,440
of like same reason to like Tolkien

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:40,430
we're all people who like to put

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:44,180
everything into our life's work and you

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:47,480
know it shows what Tolkien his book is

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:50,450
big it's not big enough but it was big

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,080
and every every Mahler symphony he tried

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:56,739
to put the whole world into it

00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,720
and you know some people live in all the

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,069
lifts in the world don't often alright

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,280
well we'll move on then so we don't end

00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:04,930
up in tears stuff here so question about

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,840
patch I think maybe not everybody knows

00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:13,260
the original author of that and I find

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,260
that very interesting because I think

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:22,449
version control that we all use today it

00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,770
is basically based on patch and DIF more

00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:26,580
or less I mean that's kind of what it's

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:31,389
tracking for all the things that it does

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:33,430
right and Perl baked in there so I'm

00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:37,060
kind of interested with the connection

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:39,430
to get how do you feel as a designer of

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,710
tools for people including languages

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,289
about get from a just a usability

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:49,419
standpoint we have talked earlier about

00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:50,669
get anxiety so well you know this is

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:54,070
actually several different questions

00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:57,729
wrapped up in one you can take your pick

00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:00,550
yeah well the user interface kind of

00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:03,490
grew over time and you know the commands

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,270
are kind of random and how you use the

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,530
switches I think fundamentally though

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,050
the people the problem that people have

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,970
with git is that they don't really

00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,160
understand them that the model

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,470
underneath is actually kind of a

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,010
functional programming model where all

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,510
the data is immutable and everything is

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,150
done as a reference to something prior

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,070
and as soon as you figure that out then

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,260
you know it becomes much easier to

00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:32,080
actually figure out what kid is trying

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,430
to do yeah yeah no I agree with that I

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,500
think that's that's probably to me I

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,940
guess that's one of the one of the hard

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,349
parts about get those you do need to

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,810
invest in getting that model you can't

00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:42,099
really effectively use it and never

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:46,030
understand you know if you come at it

00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:48,710
from from RCS CBS or you know all those

00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,960
yeah that's

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,870
it can be a little more confusing in the

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,120
beginning are you aware of or do you

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,500
think that there can you think of a

00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,630
candidate that might replace it I know

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,949
SVN was just everybody used it for the

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,889
longest time and everybody just thought

00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:06,259
wow this is great we're done and then it

00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:09,370
seems so fast we'd get just like Espeon

00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:12,229
was just gone you see another iteration

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:16,669
I don't see another iteration unless

00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:19,490
somebody can figure out a different

00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:21,380
level of interface that goes on top of

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,610
something and then it might get replaced

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,530
with the back end but I you know or some

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:31,449
company does something huge that that

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,449
just uses something different I mean I

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,750
[Music]

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,970
story because that was based on there's

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:46,210
a translucent file system which was

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:50,419
really cool thing and it turned out

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:51,919
people actually use pearl inside they

00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:55,010
have to do they're translucent file

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,610
system they wrote their file system

00:06:55,010 --> 00:07:00,500
handlers in C and they said when they

00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:05,389
rewrote it in Perl it ran eight times

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:07,990
faster so I think they were not writing

00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:10,280
very good see yeah all right all right

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,159
all right

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,830
so let's move on I have a question a

00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:18,560
little bit about JavaScript so I think

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,909
and again I'm a high level JavaScript

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,289
user but I've always been kind of

00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:23,539
interested so they kind of started off

00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:24,620
and if you read some of the the training

00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:26,240
books and since that was a prototype

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,039
chase language but then you know

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,509
everyone was learning oh oh so they kind

00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,830
of bolted on oh oh and this sounds kind

00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:33,110
of familiar maybe if there's another

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,550
language of your program in and then

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,680
it's kind of an interesting thing I had

00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,419
some friends who started writing in

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,979
CoffeeScript which was kind of layer on

00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,389
top of JavaScript because they gave them

00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:42,680
better syntax which they liked and then

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:44,870
I think they've started to fold some of

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,699
that in so I guess it's from a language

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,699
evolution perspective

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,040
you know how much you follow javascript

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,810
and for that that path of evolving over

00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,040
time I guess you need things challenging

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,030
and yet it seems to be one of the most

00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,960
exceptional language that's what

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,150
everyone says that they're learning

00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,320
first now to me I find that confusing

00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:08,850
that there's all these different models

00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:12,420
and I suppose my main beef with the

00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:14,070
model of a month you know now we'll use

00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,600
this library know now you gotta use this

00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:19,950
library and I gotta rewrite everything

00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:22,110
again coffee kind of chaos that you know

00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,680
it was Perl 5 we've made the opposite

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,770
mistake

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,420
there's never never breaking anything

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:30,330
with Perl 6 we made the opposite

00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:34,980
opposite mistake and broke everything

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:39,360
but you know someday somebody's gonna

00:08:34,980 --> 00:09:00,090
solve that problem and I hope it's Perl

00:08:39,360 --> 00:09:02,580
6 but we'll see ya well what was listed

00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:05,130
in the program of course was something

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,530
about economically but his malaria well

00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:10,530
or you know that was a pun on you know

00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:13,980
the dismal science but I've been giving

00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:19,740
talks about how you know pro farming was

00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:21,980
an art not a science but yeah I felt

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,980
like

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:36,420
yeah I I can make shadow pictures up

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:53,790
here of a camel and what we're talking

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:55,170
about oh yeah check check check check

00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:02,550
check

00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:08,790
Slovak Slovak well let them figure that

00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:11,130
out hope I could project so I decided

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,260
instead to you know I couldn't figure

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:17,640
out anything to say about the dismal

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:20,100
science that wasn't dismal so instead I

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,290
cited to give the the the very first

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:28,410
hardware talk I had been playing with

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:30,750
with Perl in my house and and we we have

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,089
a dryer that goes it's out in the garage

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:37,860
you can't hear it's ago I made a sound

00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:39,780
that went we and the the doorbells goes

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:44,370
ding dong there's someone at the door

00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:46,830
Gromit and things like that and this is

00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,480
all run with Perl scripts of course so I

00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,460
said well I'll bring all this stuff in

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,910
my extant boxes and everything and I I

00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,660
brought them all on the airplane and

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,320
wouldn't you know it for the first

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,640
Hardware talk that I ever wanted to give

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,440
turned out to be the last hot rod talk I

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,140
ever wanted to give because the airline

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,330
lost my luggage until after the talk so

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,250
all you know it turned into a software

00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,050
talk I got to show my programs and play

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,980
the sounds but you know it didn't get

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,450
actually demo it and you know so that I

00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,440
guess that put me off doing hardware

00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:23,279
talks after that all right excellent

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,680
with the record that's my memory of 1999

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,920
having your luggage lost yeah my other

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,290
memory of giving a talk up at CMU is a

00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,200
year or two after that

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,300
we're losing the next year I had a I got

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,600
a loose stitch I had a cornea transplant

00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,650
some years before and I had stitches and

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,210
they're just nylon stitches they were

00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,820
every now and then one on what pop and

00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,650
one pop just right before my talk it's

00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,000
always it's not life-threatening or

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,570
anything was scraping the inside of my

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,520
eyelid so I had this really really thick

00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:56,730
jelly stuff I just loaded up my art with

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:59,390
him and you know I if I looked a little

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,560
distracted that year that's why and

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,060
immediately after the talk they took me

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,830
up to emergency and took the loose

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:09,240
stitch out but Wow

00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:13,770
true Pro so show must go on right all

00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,240
right so another topic curious to hear

00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,400
your thoughts about and we've been

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,920
talking about it at the conference how

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,900
people the way people learn programming

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,100
programming languages is changing over

00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,060
time we have different generations of

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,380
people and we have some young young

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,610
people here which is fantastic at the

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,020
conference and I've kind of been asking

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,360
like you know how did you start learning

00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,400
Perl and if you go back sort of back in

00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,680
the day O'Reilly when it first started

00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,780
you know Tim O'Reilly had the idea to

00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,190
start printing some of the the UNIX

00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,450
manuals on you know sort of dead tree

00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,530
stuff so people could have them and

00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,790
showed up at a conference and everyone's

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,380
like oh that's great it's you know that

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,570
makes it accessible for me I get that

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,370
and of course they evolved into having

00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,810
all the open-source contributors like

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,400
many of the people you don't hear at the

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:52,290
conference and yourself actually writing

00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,640
the books and starting to write books in

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,170
different styles like learning Perl

00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,330
which was much more accessible it wasn't

00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:59,550
a man page it was much more of a tour

00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:01,920
through the language and as we

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,180
fast-forward though I'm curious you know

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,760
what your thoughts are as to what the

00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,890
future of you know sort of people

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,180
learning languages might be now that you

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,380
know many things that there's tools that

00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,240
are just so much more available it's

00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,610
trivial to create like a screencast now

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,730
or a video or something like that well

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:19,560
there's still you know four five

00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,980
different learning styles that people

00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,650
have and you need to hit all of them but

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:29,610
you know more and more a lot of that

00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:30,750
need can be met online you know there's

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,240
some people who just have to have a

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,600
teacher that they interact with

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:41,249
you know tutorials are great for that

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:43,800
but I think you know most of the the

00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:45,600
reference material that we put in like

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,699
you know people keep saying well you

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,850
should write another programming Perl

00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:52,649
for Perl 6 and you know most of the

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,089
information that would go into that the

00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:55,740
reference information you can find out

00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:59,689
online now that wasn't the case when we

00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:02,279
started out so you know I think I think

00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:05,550
you know to the extent that we continue

00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:10,470
publishing books and and book like

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:12,600
things online those will tend to move

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,509
more in a philosophical why did you do

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,670
this the rationale you know more like

00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:22,679
you know the design and evolution of C

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:24,990
C++ like Strip did you know I I don't

00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:28,290
know I might be going senile too fast to

00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:30,029
actually do that but we'll see well I've

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,619
tried to I know you know just for stuff

00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:33,119
that I do with with RT and things like

00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:34,829
that I've tried to start doing just

00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:36,540
screencasts of just doing things to get

00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:38,699
videos up and you know without even

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,079
really promoting them I'm we're

00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:42,420
surprised at the number of views they

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,709
get and that's you know and and again

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,699
many people that I talk to here said I

00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:46,259
asked them you know how did you learn

00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:47,759
Pro like oh I watched a video right

00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:50,459
which I think for many of us have a

00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,199
certain age that that's your first thing

00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,459
it seems foreign but you know as you

00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,889
said you have to kind of move that it

00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,839
really depends on how accessible the

00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:00,149
information is right when you need it

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,339
the thing about starting you know it's

00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:05,129
kind of headfirst approach is it works

00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:08,759
if you don't get discouraged partway

00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:12,240
through all along Perl has been designed

00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:14,040
in every version it has been designed to

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,139
be a language that you did not have to

00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,480
learn all of it at once you could just

00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:20,490
learn the easy bits first and you know

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,790
get something done and then hopefully

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:26,610
have the information available when you

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:29,879
needed it to take the next step and and

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:32,009
the the underlying theoretical framework

00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:33,119
to carry you forward even though you

00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:34,490
didn't know that you were doing

00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:38,030
something highfalutin underneath

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,970
hmm you know we don't tell people to

00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,410
this day with the beginners we don't

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,470
explain much about you know closures and

00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,760
lexical scoping and all this stuff but

00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,170
when when people are ready to need it

00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:52,310
yeah when they need it it's there and

00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:54,170
it's there yeah so that's and that all

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,930
goes back to the linguistics that's how

00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:59,120
we learn natural languages we learned

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,620
baby talk and then we learned to talk

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,500
like a five-year-old then we learned to

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,570
talk then we learned to talk like a

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,710
teenager and it's all downhill from

00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,200
there and you don't wanna listen to any

00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,880
of that pretty much at that point so we

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,550
have a question that came in through

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,570
Twitter this is from oh so there's an I

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,760
in this so I have to say that it came

00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:19,280
from David Han he says that once he

00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,410
sheepishly admitted tulare that he'd

00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,700
chosen java for the current project and

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,290
a year response was there's more than

00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,780
one way to do it and his question is

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,880
that this seems to be truly a general

00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,290
ethic and not merely you know there's

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,970
more than one way to do it in Perl but

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,650
truly there's more than one way to do it

00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,540
can you talk a little bit more about

00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:37,610
that ethic from a problem solving

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,990
perspective not just a you know you can

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,260
do it in any language you want as long

00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,940
as it's Perl kind of thing well it

00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,940
doesn't matter what walk of life yeah

00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:49,880
you have to you have to be embedded in a

00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:53,840
culture to do it but you always really

00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:57,670
have to look beyond that culture you

00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,870
know in terms of anthropology we have

00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:01,280
you know we have our village here and

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,690
there's other villages out there that

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,710
you have other ways of looking things

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,570
they speak to slightly different

00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:08,120
languages or greatly different languages

00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:10,250
and you know we we have to like

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,280
contribute to the village we also have

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:18,830
to interact with those other villages in

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:21,320
a useful way so a lot of the whether

00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:23,120
you're programming or or any kind of

00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,330
problem solving you know they talk about

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,680
thinking outside the box but a great way

00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,910
to start learning to think outside of

00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,590
the box is just learning to think

00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:36,050
outside of your your culture your

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:37,820
current culture and even even if you go

00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,710
to another culture and say well you know

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,750
that's kind of court brain why are they

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,010
thinking of that way that there's even

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,190
there's reasons why they're thinking

00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:48,520
about it that way even if they're there

00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:50,710
and and often just those kind of jogs

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,500
will will get you up to a metal level

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,540
that's like outside of any culture you

00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,420
see well you know all of our cultures

00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,340
are defective but you know maybe there's

00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:04,060
some new culture we can synthesize on

00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:06,970
top of the strata of those old cultures

00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,920
that will be even better and take take

00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,450
the good parts and you know that's the

00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,640
thing I like about the whole postmodern

00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,100
thing there's a lot of bad about the

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,110
postmodern culture but we broke loose of

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,710
this idea of you know there's just one

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:22,090
way to do it

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:23,680
I've heard that slogan before and sort

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,590
of moved into you know different

00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:29,470
viewpoints are are a healthy thing

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:31,660
mm-hmm yeah and I think I've always

00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,670
appreciated with the Perl community too

00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,200
that there are the the polyglots among

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,370
us who go off and they actually

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,290
participate in other communities and

00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,180
then they bring back all the different

00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,130
ideas and the things that they do and I

00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,780
always have found you know those talks

00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,490
are ones that I go to just as you said

00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,750
just to learn differently we need to

00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,520
listen to the storytellers from our

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,860
tribe but we also need to listen to the

00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,330
storytellers from the other tribes

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,910
mm-hmm

00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,350
okay maybe a couple of quick ones

00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:59,350
hardest feature you added to Perl

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,550
someone asks hardest feature I ever

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:09,790
added to Perl

00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:12,100
oh well that's well it took it took a

00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:16,600
while to get the whole closures lexical

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:19,870
thing to work going from Perl Florida

00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,440
Perl 5 I mean that actually was a couple

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,440
years at work

00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:32,220
for Perl 6 I think actually coming up

00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:37,059
with a parser that could parse itself

00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:40,450
and be completely extensible not in any

00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:43,779
lexical scope was probably the hardest

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:44,919
thing that I worked on there but -

00:19:43,779 --> 00:19:47,980
though mostly I didn't work on the

00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:53,320
actual implementations of these things I

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:56,289
think in terms of design when we came up

00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,539
with the you know we did we did the new

00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:00,580
you know in the year 2000 and we said

00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:02,710
well let's well what would we do if we

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:06,070
could break backward compatibility and

00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:10,510
you know we I expected 20 RFC's and we

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:12,460
got 361 that dealing with that was hard

00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,559
I mean I it set me on my heels for about

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:18,580
six months before I even had a clue of

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:21,820
how to start dealing with all that and

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:23,830
then just the idea of well kind of rank

00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,649
them in order of importance in two

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,990
different sections by which chapter in

00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:32,679
the candle book they they talked about

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:36,090
and next word gave me a some sort of a

00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:39,100
an ordering of importance and then

00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,539
realizing that all these RFC's even

00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,830
though they were just you know the

00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:45,220
solutions they proposed were just

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:48,070
completely bogus in the larger scheme of

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:52,149
things they every one of them was a

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:55,450
valid pain point and I needed to just

00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:57,399
think about how we go about you know

00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,740
cleaning some of that up you know in a

00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:07,230
global fashion so that that's that was

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:07,230
the the origin of Perl 6 and you know

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,029
other than that you know most of what I

00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:14,620
got in Perl other people have done or

00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:16,269
I've stolen from elsewhere you know you

00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,250
might think regular expressions are hard

00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:19,870
but no they were just based on Henry

00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,700
Spencer's regular expression package and

00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,720
I just tweaked it and tweaked it and

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,659
tweaked it and three kids

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,830
it's my programming style just changed

00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,480
something running changed something

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,179
gonna change something run it and it

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,340
shows in the design of Perl and it works

00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:35,289
pretty well I do that too

00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,120
so it's and that's interesting it makes

00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:38,440
me think of you know you kind of gone

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,070
through four you know sort of a very

00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,200
large

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,430
with with pro/5 where where you were

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,290
more involved in you know actual

00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,000
development and adding a features but as

00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:49,090
you said for pearl six much more in that

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,420
in the designer role when you were doing

00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:54,160
that design work on pearl six did you

00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,930
find yourself sort of slipping into

00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,770
thinking about implementation I know

00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,420
this is something I think all

00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,800
programmers sort of face when you're

00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,060
when you're trying to do a design phase

00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,170
of something you're trying not to think

00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,370
about how you're gonna write the code

00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,230
but it I don't know I find it almost

00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,400
impossible you start thinking you know

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,440
and then and all sort of the bad you

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,090
know pre optimizing and oh no I can't do

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,990
it that way it'll be slow and and things

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,310
like that were you able to kind of just

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,840
divorce yourself from that and just

00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,310
focus on what you want I don't want it

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,050
divorce yourself entirely there's a

00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:22,120
level in which that is true in a level

00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:23,740
one which is false you don't want to you

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,990
know start coming you know preach it pre

00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:29,890
deciding this is how it's going to be

00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:33,250
done but the question of whether

00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:38,890
something is implementable and whether

00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:42,430
something is optimizable if you if

00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:45,610
there's a you know prior art or you can

00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:47,200
think of at least one way to do it and

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,210
you know the more ways you can think of

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,590
doing something the more likely you are

00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,720
to come up with the general solution

00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:57,910
that doesn't preclude you know whatever

00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:00,130
the right solution is so all along you

00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,140
know there's this old joke in Computer

00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:04,600
Sciences of about you know if we had a

00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,120
sufficiently smart compiler it could

00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,370
deal with this and but that was kind of

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,050
you know one of our secondary design

00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:14,080
principles you know what look let's us

00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:15,700
let's go ahead and assume that we will

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:22,320
be able to have that sufficiently smart

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:26,350
compiler someday and it was part of the

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,430
you know good fast cheap to pick - and

00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:32,440
you know we had to do a cheap you know

00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:34,420
because we're open source so it's good

00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,830
or fast pick ones and we decided to pick

00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,200
good and we know so we knew it was gonna

00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:43,420
be it's not going to be a fast process

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:46,420
to get it done so when we realized that

00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:48,640
we said well okay the second system

00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,549
syndrome done right means you just take

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,710
as long as you need

00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:57,320
to actually do everything he wanted to

00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:59,960
do and so we said okay we will not get

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,600
like a stuck in premature implementation

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,289
in terms of the design but it was always

00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:09,039
very weighing very heavily is this

00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:11,600
implementable will is there enough

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:15,350
information just in terms of information

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,659
theory enough type information to

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:21,950
optimize this because we realized a lot

00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:24,559
of the the a lot of the difficulties

00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:27,679
with growing the design of Perl five

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,809
were that the internals themselves were

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,940
confused about what the types are I mean

00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:33,830
you use a string as a number this was in

00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,600
an earlier talk you string as a number

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,730
as a number of string and Perl kind of

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,970
forgets which one it is

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:42,679
Pro five and so that was a that was the

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,450
sort of level on which we said to

00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:47,299
ourselves okay let's let's make

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:50,480
different mistakes this time we can make

00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:56,690
it look type sloppy to the user but

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:58,879
let's not be type sloppy internally as a

00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,590
result yeah it didn't take a very long

00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:04,429
time and we're still in the process of

00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:09,889
optimizing that but and it's not perfect

00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:10,730
by any means but it's getting useful all

00:25:09,889 --> 00:25:13,220
right

00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,470
a few different questions around sort of

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,899
future looking forward things like that

00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,460
if you start off with one sort of the

00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:21,169
path for Perl and again we've been

00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,840
talking about history a little bit at

00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:25,399
the conference you start back when you

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,379
know ninety nine we're talking about it

00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,309
was a lot of CGI server side basically

00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:30,499
you wrote your code on the server

00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:33,320
dynamic web pages things like that

00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:35,090
and we've kind of gone to - cloud which

00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,499
was interesting for Perl because I think

00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,600
a lot of people remember there's that

00:25:36,499 --> 00:25:40,970
phase of shared hosting where you often

00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,649
you couldn't get Perl on your shared

00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,850
host because in a lot of ways Perl was

00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:47,960
like too powerful it gave you too much

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:49,609
access to things on the system which was

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,139
interesting so interesting hear your

00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:52,279
thoughts out and then also kind of the

00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:54,739
step that we see now everyone's talking

00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:56,980
about serverless right which is Suraj is

00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:59,350
functions in the cloud you know

00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,910
on AWS and things like that and it's

00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,410
something that I thought seemed like it

00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,730
would actually lend itself very well to

00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,190
Pearl where you could write these little

00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:08,890
snippets of logic that can then just run

00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,540
sort of on demand so it I guess I feel

00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:12,850
like like Perl fits that that curve

00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,650
pretty nicely except except for that

00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,300
middle where the shared hosting folks

00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,740
never wanted to give Perl because they

00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:21,970
just it gave them too much access but

00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:24,430
you thoughts on that oh well you know

00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,500
I've been so busy doing the language

00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:31,540
design thing I've kind of stayed out of

00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:36,850
the whole cloud thing but you know the

00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:41,110
the the the culture that keeps changing

00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:44,260
the the the basic underlying questions

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:45,670
keep changing I mean used to be it's

00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:49,960
always been the case that people have

00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:52,740
tried for no locational transparency you

00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:55,390
know going back to NFS and before that

00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,160
you know you rent something and you sort

00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:00,700
of don't want to care whether it's

00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:03,400
running locally or somewhere else it's

00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,080
always been the case that you know you

00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,670
always had this huge side effect if it's

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,310
somewhere else it's a lot slower you had

00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:11,470
to really care and so you do care and

00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:16,300
there's some level on which you always

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:19,480
want to take Donald conduce rule that

00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,550
you know a really good programmer should

00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,620
know the entire stack all the way down

00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:26,170
and what are the trade-offs at every

00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:30,250
level you can't can't just always

00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:32,830
abstract things away hmm you know that

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:36,280
being said the the granularity of

00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:40,450
abstractions keeps getting bigger so you

00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:44,710
know with NFS it's just a distant seek

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:46,930
you know this cooperation with with then

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,610
it became a remote procedure calls and

00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,500
then now it's you know all this

00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:51,970
container stuff and you just throw a big

00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:57,010
thing in a container and throw it over

00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:59,200
the wall and it goes so you know I what

00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,460
are what happens after that containers

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,820
of containers the other thing that goes

00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:05,890
on all the time is this this big

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,789
pendulum keeps going back and forth over

00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:10,140
distributed versus

00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:11,880
I mean no that's the same thing

00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:15,270
distributed versus central forces yeah

00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:17,429
and that pendulum in the industry is

00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,350
swung back and forth you know at least

00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,600
three times by night and they're

00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,650
probably swing back again right now with

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,630
all the cloud stuff

00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,580
it's Rimmel but you know you know you go

00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,740
into fries and look at the disk shelf

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,919
you know and they have these disk drive

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:34,169
to say cloud on your desk you know so

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:38,610
there's this forces coming to bring

00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:40,740
stuff back in as well so or maybe it's

00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:42,780
one of these stamping pendulous

00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:46,860
eventually finds a happy medium in the

00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:50,370
middle about there's always these swings

00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:52,650
back and forth we've learned in Silicon

00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:57,659
Valley that it's a very cyclical

00:28:52,650 --> 00:29:00,900
business and you can't really you know

00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:02,549
plan five years out oh the buzz words

00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,530
will be all different yeah well and

00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:05,820
everyone who actually knows how this

00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:07,049
stuff works probably most people in this

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,030
room knows there's a disk running

00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:10,530
somewhere it can be cloud it can be

00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,909
serverless whatever there's a server

00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,470
somewhere that someone has to take care

00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:16,850
of I mean there's there's there's a

00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:21,890
sense in which this this whole services

00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:24,299
that the big folks provide you know

00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:26,340
Google and Facebook and all stuff worth

00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:28,919
where they're hiding their code behind a

00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,450
web interface is is actually a kind of

00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:34,110
reaction to the whole open-source

00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:36,809
movement it's a way of not sharing the

00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:38,850
source code so maybe there's you know

00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:41,940
maybe that's another pendulum it's gonna

00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:44,130
swing back the other way as as the big

00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,880
companies get in trouble for being a

00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:49,679
little too big well and interesting to

00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,620
just to follow that thought that how

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,090
many applications now even you know sort

00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,710
of commercial applications even provide

00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,970
a version that you can run locally I

00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,830
mean everything that you can think of

00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,120
the most people run now is is a cloud

00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,520
hosted thing like you go to a website

00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,900
and you use it and it's hosted you know

00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,730
all of the the big things that you can

00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,039
think of now there very few new things

00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,809
that come out have a version you can run

00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,950
on premise whether it paid or not paid

00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:12,750
or open source

00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:14,669
yeah there's pressure to have both those

00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,770
thing you know you got github but you

00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:18,750
can also run your own get sure yeah

00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:20,460
yeah but I don't think can you run your

00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:27,780
own slack does anybody know I don't

00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:29,160
think you can yeah yeah open source -

00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,600
open source maybe still keeping folks

00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,340
honest by by chasing the stuff and

00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,059
saying it's not that hard we'll do one

00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:38,450
yeah so alright so a few other questions

00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:47,190
that we can get coming in from Twitter

00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:49,200
favorite pro/5 and Perl 6 features my

00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,990
wife will tell you that I am terrible at

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,580
exam and coming up with examples that's

00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:57,870
why I never was good at historical

00:30:53,580 --> 00:31:01,050
linguistics like his kids right you

00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:02,370
can't pick one not supposed to do it at

00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:16,080
least not publicly and certainly not on

00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:21,440
video for the whole internet you know I

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:24,360
as a linguist my favorite think about

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,970
Perl 5 was actually that it is

00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,830
essentially a creole language you know

00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,710
sort of started out as a pidgin language

00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:37,290
where it borrows from many different

00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:38,850
sources so just the synthesis of taking

00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:42,120
different cultures in like regular

00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:45,210
expressions and you know print formats

00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,520
and shell programming and all these

00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:50,120
things in awk and smashing him into a

00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,740
thing and actually making the mesh that

00:31:50,120 --> 00:32:00,929
was the thing that made me happiest

00:31:52,740 --> 00:32:02,490
about pearls 1 through 5 with Perl 6

00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:06,110
because we're trying to make different

00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:09,000
mistakes we realized oh we actually have

00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:11,760
the one time opportunity to sort of

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,740
create instead of just borrowing culture

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,440
from it right we can kind of fix all

00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,850
these bits that the the the horrible

00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:23,179
regular expression syntax that we

00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:23,179
inherited from UNIX the

00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:28,429
just the the various ways in which other

00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:31,190
computer languages have kind of gone

00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:34,460
wrong we have a one-time chance to kind

00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:37,639
of clean a lot of that up and to make

00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:42,070
something that is extensible into the

00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:45,200
future and so just just the way the the

00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:48,429
everything inside the the the compiler

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:53,619
is written in terms of this idea that

00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:55,970
there really is no one true language I

00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:58,580
mean you think Perl six is one language

00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,230
but it's actually there's the the basic

00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,239
syntax and as soon as you drop into a

00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,950
regular expression or a string it's just

00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:05,659
dropping into a different compiler and

00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,960
then popping back out again at the end

00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:10,220
so you never get these problems with

00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,499
that we get in Perl 5 where it

00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,690
interprets the string one way and he

00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:17,919
goes back and read parses it and you

00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:20,149
know the whole source filter Fiasco the

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,710
multiple passes that happen on regular

00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:23,960
expressions this just never happens in

00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:26,389
Perl 6 and I think that's the thing I'm

00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:30,190
happiest about that is that we were able

00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:32,149
to do that synthesis yeah it's not

00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:34,159
terribly useful right now but I think

00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:34,460
it'll be terribly useful going into the

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,769
future

00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:41,570
mm-hmm as people decide to extend it

00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:43,519
into different domain specific areas for

00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,960
what it's worth I think at least from my

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,639
experience I think for people who

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,049
learned Perl and maybe didn't come from

00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:49,759
a system administration background or

00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:51,769
didn't know sort of all the places where

00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:54,019
some of that stuff was stolen from the

00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:55,909
the cracks were papered over pretty well

00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:57,169
it's all they just to them to many of

00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:59,659
those programmers who don't know all

00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:01,369
that stuff it looks like Perl to them so

00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:03,769
it was it was a it was a decent rehab

00:34:01,369 --> 00:34:05,899
job it was an attempt to take this this

00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:07,759
UNIX culture which you know do one thing

00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:09,559
and do it well was the the mantra but

00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:12,349
nothing did one thing and nothing did it

00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:14,480
well and there were limitations all over

00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:16,460
the place it was attempt to actually do

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,589
those things well and do them all in one

00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,559
place so as you could write other tools

00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:23,089
that did one thing and do them well so

00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:26,510
it was funny because the the Bell Labs

00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:28,929
crowd sort of rejected Perl in the early

00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:31,399
days because it tried to do everything

00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:33,750
but then you know it ended up kind of

00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:37,950
sneaking back into the toolbox

00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:40,380
and not just be a tool but to be a tool

00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:45,390
that said that a machine shop for making

00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:48,960
other tools and so that worked out well

00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:52,680
yeah sort of similar on the on the pro

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,330
five pearl six biggest feature if if and

00:34:52,680 --> 00:35:04,980
when you're playing around in pro five

00:34:54,330 --> 00:35:10,290
that you miss from pearl six they're

00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:12,930
just different I guess what I what I

00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:16,110
really miss is the ability to write

00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:19,830
multi methods and it goes back to the

00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:21,720
the the type system underneath you have

00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,760
to have a rigorous type system in order

00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,050
to do smart matching right which is why

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,990
I didn't really work out when it was

00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:30,870
back ported and you need smart matching

00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:34,020
to do switch statements and multi method

00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:35,610
dispatch you know not that not that my

00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,470
basic programming style uses that

00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:39,900
terribly often I mean you look at my

00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:43,740
pearl six programs they look like kind

00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:46,130
of like pro five yeah is it's it's other

00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:49,170
people that that make better use of

00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:52,680
pearl six features than I do but it's

00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:55,020
always kind of been my skill set has

00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:58,280
kind of synthesized what other people

00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:02,880
need more than I what I what just I need

00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,890
I just have always had kind of a gut

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,980
level feeling for what people will like

00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:10,800
and and even if it's not something that

00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:15,120
naturally occurs to my programming style

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,040
I like to enable multiple styles that's

00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,870
one of the nicest things about at least

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,200
Perl 5 you can you can code any language

00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:23,340
in it so and often you can see that you

00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,440
can tell when people come from other

00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,330
backgrounds you can look at their code

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,790
to be like oh Java programmer huh all

00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:35,430
right all right a couple maybe not quite

00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:37,560
so directly Perl related questions most

00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,090
challenging a non-technical issue you've

00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:43,590
ever dealt with I guess related to pearl

00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:45,950
but non technical just keeping everyone

00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,950
from flight

00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:52,520
when people fight I get post-traumatic

00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:54,860
stress just for many historical reasons

00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:58,400
most some of what you're out completely

00:36:54,860 --> 00:37:02,720
outside of broom culture so that that's

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:07,730
hard on me I I really really hate yeah

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:15,530
it drives me nuts almost literally to

00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:20,570
see that and and so that that's the

00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:23,600
hardest thing for me is I really stress

00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:27,410
out when when when I see people being

00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:29,270
mean to other people or or deciding the

00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:34,450
other other people who are also trying

00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:38,960
their best are somehow evil that just I

00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:40,370
have difficulty dealing with that yeah

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,800
and unfortunately we're seeing that in a

00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,750
lot of areas outside of even well you

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,480
know it's code it's an ancient problem

00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:50,000
the Bible talks about in the end times

00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,430
the love of most will grow cold and you

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,700
know we see not much love in the world

00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:58,850
these days you know on any level and so

00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:01,430
you know I'll give you the the message

00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:03,700
of the Apostle John little children love

00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,700
one another

00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:12,460
[Applause]

00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,140
so I have to imagine over the years

00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,120
you've been to tons of conferences not

00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,890
just pearl and not just ASEAN but have

00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,990
you been invited to too many other types

00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,390
of events just to come speak and you

00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:25,350
know they all have weird names like

00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:30,790
distractions and and abstractions and

00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:32,500
Korean and that the weirdest thing by

00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:34,660
God invited to was that they're the

00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:37,120
functional programmers the academic ones

00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:40,930
have a once a year get together it's

00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:44,080
just a kind of a colloquium of really

00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:45,760
smart people and they they go they

00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,330
invited me to be their non functional

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,160
programmer when we went to Iceland and

00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:54,190
we were like a hundred hundred feet away

00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,530
from the the mid-atlantic rift you know

00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,130
I lied awake all night saying is it

00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:01,720
gonna erupt

00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:06,820
is he gonna erupt but so that that was a

00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:08,590
very good but that was I presented some

00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,530
of the initial design of Perl 6 there

00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:15,120
and they actually had some useful things

00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:18,940
to say about how to do functional

00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:21,190
programming underneath and that helped

00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,770
to some in the design so but yeah

00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:28,780
there's there's lots of lots of

00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:32,830
different conference I also to use Perl

00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:35,110
I actually used Perl heavily our church

00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:37,330
has a team quizzing Bible quizzing the

00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:40,300
thing and I have written a lot of Perl

00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:42,250
programs in support of scorekeeping and

00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,500
scheduling for some of the conference's

00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,570
they have there and we do that every

00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:49,550
every couple years they have their big

00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:51,640
conference and are they on github

00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:55,070
[Music]

00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,030
the most memorable most memorable talk

00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,500
that you've gone through that you can

00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:02,270
remember or experience at at a

00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:09,140
conference over the years oh well all of

00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:11,240
Damien's talk sort of blur together the

00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:15,589
picture of the guys being blasted by his

00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,520
loudspeakers yeah yeah what was it what

00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:19,790
were this commercial is what were the

00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:23,570
speakers nobody remember Memorex was it

00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:26,920
Memorex all right yeah come on don't you

00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,920
all have the internet in front of you

00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,690
all right well very good so we've got

00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,430
about five minutes left so we'll we'll

00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:36,920
get close to wrapping up a common

00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:37,970
question that we've got here and in some

00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,890
of the discussions of having at the

00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:41,780
conference which is great because it was

00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,760
part of the reason for Sawyer bringing

00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,490
it up was his talk about you know some

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,680
of his ideas for where we're going for

00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:50,630
the future so he presented you know a

00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,220
few different things is that one of it

00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:54,280
I've mentioned already thinking about

00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:56,630
the ways that we do documentation and

00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,450
training and getting people into the

00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:01,069
language thinking about features maybe

00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:03,140
tightening things up a little bit to

00:41:01,069 --> 00:41:06,170
make syntax less surprising things like

00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:08,089
that so from from the the keynote talk

00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:12,200
that Sawyer gave thoughts on on some of

00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:20,930
the things that he offered there good

00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:25,869
luck you know it's when you start

00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:29,660
breaking things other things break and

00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:32,720
you know we took we took the opposite

00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:35,480
approach of that Python did Python just

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,890
broke a few things and cleaned them up

00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,480
and look how long it took them to

00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:40,190
they're still trying to get people to

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:49,069
switch from Python to to the Python 3

00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:50,359
yeah it's hard and so yeah they're there

00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:52,940
probably more things that can be

00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:56,829
deprecated certainly there are there you

00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,829
know more things that can be

00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:03,970
you know borrowed back from the Pearl

00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:05,740
six design if that's desirable I I was

00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:07,720
actually delighted that you know a lot

00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:13,269
of the things that happened to Pearl

00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:16,089
five over the last decade or so you know

00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:17,859
it they're they're ideas that you know

00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:20,130
also occurred to Pearl six and you know

00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:22,299
I think it's the right direction that

00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:23,559
that those things have been fixed but

00:42:22,299 --> 00:42:26,529
you know if you're going to fix some

00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:27,849
fundamental things then you know having

00:42:26,529 --> 00:42:31,269
a better type system that actually

00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:36,130
extends to the built-in types that's

00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:40,569
that's that's tough and you know pearl

00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:42,549
six is one data point there there may be

00:42:40,569 --> 00:42:44,890
intermediate so things that can be done

00:42:42,549 --> 00:42:47,680
but it's it's hard just it's really

00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:50,589
really hard you know I hate slippery

00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,500
slope arguments because usually used to

00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:56,470
justify extreme positions but this is

00:42:53,500 --> 00:43:00,579
one slippery slope you start you start

00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:02,079
breaking plates these steps you know you

00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:04,289
have to break you end up having to break

00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:09,130
almost all the eggs to make the omelet

00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:11,710
in my experience but maybe that's just

00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:13,990
me one more thought that he that he had

00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:16,029
in his talk also was about sort of the

00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:17,680
relationship between the development of

00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:19,839
open source languages and corporate

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,519
sponsorship and he had some examples of

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,410
and there and it's interesting actually

00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,029
it's kind of nice in a way I guess from

00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:26,650
my perspective that there are so many

00:43:25,029 --> 00:43:28,660
experiments if you will going on because

00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:30,730
almost all the languages do have a

00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:33,910
slightly different model in the way that

00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:35,829
they either our own sponsored helped

00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:38,259
along by various companies that have

00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:40,119
decided to sort of invest in those so

00:43:38,259 --> 00:43:42,279
any thoughts on either a particular

00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,420
company and/or model and/or language

00:43:42,279 --> 00:43:45,759
that you think is either doing it well

00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:48,220
or potentially goes into it maybe a

00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:50,319
place that's not so good and you know is

00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,630
there anything that you would suggest or

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,710
see as like the best way for pearl to go

00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,569
if you could just make it happen

00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:59,200
I I'm probably the wrong person to ask

00:43:55,569 --> 00:44:02,079
because I I did not even predict the web

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,640
I mean yeah I made pearl a text

00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,690
processing language in a glue language

00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,099
because I just had this gut level

00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:08,440
feeling those will be needed in the

00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:11,350
future but to me that sounds like he

00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:14,480
kind of predicted the web yeah

00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:18,260
well you know Tim O'Reilly once gave me

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,720
a great compliment he said you know I

00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:22,160
don't know I don't know I don't

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,870
understand what Larry wall is doing with

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:28,010
pearl sticks but he sees around corners

00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:30,590
and I took that as a compliment but in

00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:32,870
terms of corporate sponsorship if you

00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,790
look at you know what's out there you

00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,650
could not have predicted at any one

00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:39,590
point and you can't go out and get a

00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:41,570
corporate sponsor in that sense it

00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:44,330
corporate sponsorship usually arises

00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:46,400
because somebody at a grassroots level

00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:48,170
started using something and they just

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,950
happen to be you know the people who

00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:53,060
bootstrapped

00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:55,160
a new initiative so I mean you you would

00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:57,320
when PHP started off you would not have

00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,870
predicted that you know that maybe the

00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:06,860
two two biggest supporters of it would

00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:08,840
be IBM and and Facebook and you know

00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:11,930
similarly with Python you know the fact

00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:15,620
that you know Google sort of pictured it

00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:17,390
picked it it's almost an accident yeah

00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,740
they had a bit of kind of had a vote ish

00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:20,120
type thing internal I mean I'm sure they

00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,340
were using every language Under the Sun

00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:27,350
and they had to pick one right so well

00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:30,170
they said no this is you know you can't

00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:31,910
just you know can't just we'll some of

00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:34,910
these things into existence they you

00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:37,460
have to go with the flow of history and

00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:40,070
wait for the next wave to come in and

00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:42,830
hopefully recognize it but you can't

00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:45,380
make the wave come in yeah so to the

00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:46,970
extent though if there's a wave do you

00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,920
would you thought be that we should pick

00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:50,030
it if there were people who you know I'm

00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,200
not obviously we have great sponsorship

00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:53,300
for the code for the conference and for

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,490
Perl in general but if someone had come

00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:58,400
along how do you think that would help

00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:59,720
or hinder Perl or it just would take it

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,390
in a different direction and it doesn't

00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,550
have to have a value judgment it would

00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:09,080
have advantages or disadvantages both

00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:14,600
ways you know everything we do in life

00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:16,280
you know we we all pollute we all have a

00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,910
big carbon footprint probably more than

00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,290
we should we all you know take in

00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:23,090
perfectly good food and turn it into

00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:26,000
something else

00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:29,210
we all you know make our mess in the

00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,880
world but hopefully we we all try to

00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:40,190
balance that out with trying to do some

00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:42,800
good and if we can see a great good that

00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:44,990
doesn't have you know too much harm well

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,990
that might be a trade-off worth taking

00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:54,410
sometimes great Goods come with great

00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:57,920
arms sometimes you come out ahead so but

00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:59,660
you know for me it's always I've always

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,710
just been more of the thee at the other

00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:06,050
end of the spectrum where I just tried

00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:07,520
to do good where I am and sometimes

00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:11,770
that's a big place in sometimes that's a

00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:17,090
small place and I'm just as happy

00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:19,340
pulling weeds out of my garden or or you

00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:21,260
know running the sounds and lights at my

00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:26,480
church I think Jeanne hackneyed some

00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:27,470
help with that I think he actually yeah

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,970
rocks weeds

00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:33,770
he loves landscape fabric though but if

00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:35,300
anyone can run out to Lowe's I think he

00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:36,890
would probably like a roll or two but

00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,720
yeah just you know bloom where you're

00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:41,720
planted some time but to recognize

00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:47,030
whether that's a you know a window box

00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:49,190
or a much larger piece of dirt well I

00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:52,610
would most definitely put pearl on the

00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:54,200
good side of that ledger and thank you

00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:56,180
for sitting up here and answering all of

00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,800
our questions and thank you for Pearl

00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,520

00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:07,480
