Title: Chris Prather - "Lessons Learned From Scouting's Premiere Leadership Course"
Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	Having completed a scouting leadership challenge has given me better insight in how to be a team or community leader. In this talk we'll explore the high level overview of the BSA's Wood Badge Leadership training and how it can apply to managing an open source community.
We will cover:
- Establishing Vision and Values
- Bringing the Vision to Life
- Team Development Models
- Conflict Solving and Decision Making
- Leaving a Legacy

There will be no spoilers and due to restrictions by the hotel no s'mores.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,000
so real quick before we get to started

00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:09,269
you notice I'm in uniform how many

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,849
people know Paul Fenwick Paul Fenwick's

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,889
father passed away unexpectedly he's

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,540
going through some time so if you have a

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:16,710
chance to reach out to him on Twitter or

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,720
something and just give him some

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,310
commemorates I say this because the

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,890
first time I have organized a Jaap see

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,300
Paul showed up the day before the

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,580
conference was supposed to start asking

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,949
me if he could give a talk I found him a

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,619
space because if Paul asked you if you

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,130
can give a talk you always say yes I

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,840
found his space the next day he was

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,850
giving his talk my brother walked past

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,660
the room and Paul was in full Starfleet

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,059
uniform that was my brother's

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,860
introduction to the Perl community so

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:54,629
yeah just have Paul and your thoughts

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:57,870
and right now um okay so this is Happy

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,850
Campers lessons learned from Scouting's

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,289
from your leadership course I've

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,489
completely rewritten this talk last

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,809
night so we're gonna see how well this

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,479
goes this is the first time I'm actually

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:12,500
going through all of it so it may be a

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:14,790
whirlwind and 2002 the in 2013 my son

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,400
discovered a Cub Scout Handbook in the

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,990
back of his grandfather's car whether

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,750
this was a happy accident or intentional

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:25,470
is still being hotly debated in our

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:30,030
household by 2014 I was cub master of my

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:33,030
son's pack within two years of that I

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,130
was a crew advisor for a venture crew

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,350
for my daughter's for my daughter I'm

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,759
currently an assistant scoutmaster in

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,829
two different pack are two different

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:47,430
troops and I stepped down as cub master

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:49,350
last year thank you

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,610
Boy Scouts of America how many people

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,390
here know about what Scouts of America

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,280
okay

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:58,680
Boy Scouts of America serves 2.3 million

00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,570
youth over 75,000 individual units it's

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,420
almost entirely volunteer based and when

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,120
I say almost entirely I actually asked

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,380
my local scouting representatives for

00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,550
some information in my local districts

00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,440
packs and troops you all are familiar

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,360
with I'm sure that the smallest unit

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,550
they're entirely volunteer run they're

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,050
run by three volunteers plus as many

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,330
parents as they can wrangle into doing

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,160
stuff packs and troops are then

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,810
organized into councils and the councils

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,090
may divide up into districts depending

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,860
on how big the council is our district

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:34,980
has 21,000 100 youth 686 adult

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,720
volunteers and we have an exceptionally

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:42,060
large number double the average number

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,370
of paid professionals we have two so the

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,730
parallels between scouting and

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,320
opensource seem very familiar I believe

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,600
somebody this morning was asking for

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,120
more corporate sponsorship and more

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,560
corporate time scouting always is

00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,690
looking for more people that have paid

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,370
time to devote to scouting a common

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,530
phrase in Scouting circles because of

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,150
the volunteer nature is every Scout

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,450
deserves a trained leader and my

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,519
experience is usually shouted

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:14,010
enthusiastically by older Scouters older

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,480
adult volunteers to younger people who

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,680
are sitting there wondering why the hell

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,790
they're in this church to amaze me I'm

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,070
on a Thursday night and their kids

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,269
nowhere to be seen

00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,340
because they got wrangled into being Cub

00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:26,519
master when the last one decided that he

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,080
needed to move on but training is

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,940
important common sense and research

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,540
shows that people who are trained and

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,160
we're confident they're better equipped

00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,230
at the role that they're performing

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,310
knowledge and confidence reassure and

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,600
comfort the people around you

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,519
comfortable people are more likely to

00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,250
continue participating and can continue

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,959
joining a trained leader is better

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,900
prepared to improve whatever project

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:56,880
you're working on so every project

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:58,769
deserves a trained leader Scouting's

00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,709
premier training for leaders is called

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,810
would batch

00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:04,920
how many people other than will have

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:08,709
heard of wood badge before

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,299
okay so wood badge was started by Lord

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:14,079
baden-powell who started scouting it was

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:16,989
started in 1900s it's an international

00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,850
leadership training course every country

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:21,250
with a scouting movement has their own

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,250
form of wood badge they each have their

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,860
own training curriculum in the United

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,440
States it's a 6 day course that

00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,690
simulates the true process you go for

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,099
two weekends and in my council it's two

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,539
weekends some places they do it for a

00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:38,229
full week

00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:42,490
there's indoor and outdoor parts to the

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:44,190
course there's also a 18 month practical

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,990
application after the course is done

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:53,169
we've got 50 minutes so we're not going

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:55,750
to do the outdoor portions so why am I

00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:58,270
here there's the story they tell in the

00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:01,210
first day of wood batch some time ago a

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,740
young boy joined two organizations he

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,270
agreed to became an adult and one of

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,849
those organizations continues to have

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,560
him as a member when asked why he stayed

00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:11,020
with the one organization he responded

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,460
that he joined then when he joined he

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,979
was made to feel welcome and important

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,599
his opinion seemed to count he learned

00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:18,340
and he learned while he was having fun

00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:19,659
he liked being part of a group that

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,490
seemed to always give him something to

00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:23,680
look forward to

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:26,409
will the youth and our units say the

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,240
same in several years from now so I like

00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:31,199
being a part of something that gives me

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,810
something to look forward to I enjoy

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,990
being part of a community that embraces

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,310
and and makes me feel welcome and I hope

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:44,620
to give you guys something to look

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:46,930
forward to today so now the question is

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,720
why are you here

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,340
take a moment wood badge has some

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,229
questions that they give you before you

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,300
go I'm gonna read off a very shortened

00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:56,590
form of them take a moment if you have a

00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,240
piece of paper I know they gave us all

00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,050
notebooks and pens but I put mine in my

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,880
room immediately

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,229
as soon as I could so if you have

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,370
something jot this down or just think

00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:08,169
about it later what do you think your

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,680
greatest strengths are what do you think

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:13,509
others think your greatest strengths are

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,169
who's made the most insignificant impact

00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:21,810
in your life and why would have been

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:25,659
your happiest moments in your life why

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:27,969
what do you most enjoy doing if you had

00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:31,259
unlimited resources and could choose to

00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:34,840
do anything what would you choose to do

00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:37,810
what do you dream daydream of doing when

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,639
you're just sitting idle what are the

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,560
three or four most important things to

00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,849
you when you look at your life what

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,650
activities do you consider are the

00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:49,479
greatest worth what are the what do you

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,599
do the best that you can contribute to

00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,639
others and finally what are you hoping

00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:59,400
to get out of being in here right now

00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,930
for the next 30 minutes 40 minutes

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,240
there's no test you don't have to share

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,740
this with anybody just think about them

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,060
if you need to refresh your later I'll

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:14,560
have all of these slides posted online

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:16,029
so why are we here so the Boy Scouts of

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,610
America is a fairly conservative

00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:22,060
organization that's probably

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,650
understating it a little bit but over

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,169
the last couple decades its conservative

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:29,620
nature's earned it a reputation for

00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:31,389
intolerance which is a little a little

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,279
unfair because over the last several

00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:36,310
years they've been working very hard on

00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,949
making changes to be more tolerant or to

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:43,180
embrace a larger a more diverse set of

00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:46,120
attitudes this week we're here because

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,589
we all share a love of a community it's

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:54,879
a community that over the last several

00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:57,969
years is earned a reputation we're

00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,819
changing things are progressing we could

00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:02,620
spend a lot of time comparing our

00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:06,069
gathering here to similar gatherings

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,800
like oh we could spend a lot of time

00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:12,639
comparing ourselves to oskins and other

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:17,050
stuff last year Vicki Berserker gave a

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:19,449
keynote titled the importance of the

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:22,630
importance of an ecosystem it discussed

00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:29,590
cascade effects and trophic cascades

00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:31,450
and the kind that the as an analogy for

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:35,169
the way our communities is evolving and

00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:37,289
moving forward it was a bit of a call to

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:37,289
action

00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,169
we spent a decade or two of gaining a

00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,290
reputation of our own some of it is

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:46,180
earned some of it isn't but we aren't

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,930
who we once were and we need to figure

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,930
out where we're going

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,140
not only as pearls were a pearls place

00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,970
in the open-source community of changing

00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:02,740
the open-source community itself is

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:06,130
changing we live in the Chinese proverb

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,530
of interesting times how many people

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,570
have heard of the Redis versus Amazon

00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,700
kerfuffle Redis is changing their

00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,530
license John I know you probably have

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,150
because you live near Viki and I'm sure

00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:21,580
you can hear the screams every time she

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:23,110
opens her email Amazon has a hosted

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,820
version of Redis they don't contribute

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,260
back the open source or edits trying to

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,040
change their licensing to try and keep

00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,020
that from happening

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,790
open source communities are finding that

00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,710
it's very difficult to create a business

00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,370
model around open source in a

00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,290
traditional way

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:38,080
having venture capital makes that even

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,910
more difficult so open source as a as a

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,580
project is starting to go through a sea

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,700
change because we've unfortunately been

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:49,270
very successful most software these days

00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,460
is run on an open source platform Amazon

00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,620
hosts something like 80 or 90% of the

00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,180
Internet they don't contribute back but

00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:02,200
all of their software to do that is open

00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:04,750
source this past february in the first

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,100
time in the 108 years of its history the

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,580
scouting movement started introducing

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:12,010
girls to its primary its flagship

00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,790
program boy scouts are going through a

00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,790
sea change to

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,340
so what are we going to do with all the

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,740
changes coming I still want to feel

00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,300
welcome and important and I want to have

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,420
fun I want to be a part of a group

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,860
that's having fun the Boy Scouts are

00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,780
leaning leaning on their trained leaders

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:38,250
to help manage this change we need to

00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,590
ensure that we have trained leaders to

00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:44,190
help us through ours so how do we ensure

00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:45,810
our leaders have decent training well we

00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,620
could rely upon the existing leaders but

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,870
there's a problem

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,980
our leaders much like the scouting

00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:56,250
leaders are aging out when the reason I

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,620
became cub master six months after my

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,020
son joined Cub Scouts is because the

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,240
last Cup matches a youngest son had

00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,430
become a Boy Scout and he was no longer

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,730
associated with the Cub Scout program he

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:12,290
needed to move on built in rebuilt in

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:16,440
obsolescence we're having the same thing

00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:19,530
how many names were on your list Sawyer

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,050
a bunch not all of them were rec but

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,480
most of them I mean there was a large

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,390
number of names we have some but it

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,790
wasn't until Jesse Vincent that we had

00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,790
built-in obsolescence for our leadership

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:38,520
guido van rossum stepped down as

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,620
benevolent dictator for life gave

00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,200
himself a permanent vacation and he said

00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:47,160
literally said I don't care what you

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,230
guys do with this but I'm out we don't

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,420
want to be in that position we need to

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,310
start thinking about how our leadership

00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,400
and who's going to replace when Sawyer

00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:58,980
gets hit by a truck or Stephen finally

00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:03,260
has enough of his crop and SHIVs him in

00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:05,060
the night we need to start thinking

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:11,420
there's

00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:13,490
because I can see you when Sawyer

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,520
decides that he wants to go do something

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:22,250
more fun than being pumped in because

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:23,630
it's a tough job how are we going to

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,480
replace that who's going to be trained

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,740
to take care of to take on those roles

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:35,260
we need to ensure that our leaders have

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:37,760
decent training there's another story in

00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,440
that they tell an wood badge that

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,870
reminds me a lot of open-source it's

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,220
about cathedrals well okay it's about a

00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:48,440
kid well it's about a chapel in the

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,730
1300s and it this is a legend I don't

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,950
know if this is true and the scouter

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,120
Scouters who taught me this I'm sure

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,850
they don't know it's true but they had

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,150
pictures so it's good enough for me in

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,680
the 1300s Cambridge University they

00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:04,130
built a new chapel for one of their

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,930
colleges the roof was a vaulted roof it

00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:10,850
was beautiful and it was supported by

00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:13,130
these giant old oak Timbers they were

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,390
gorgeous they lasted for ages this is

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,580
why they used the material the

00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,840
workmanship was superb it's not stuff we

00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:24,650
do anymore when we just slap stuff

00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:28,190
together yada yada yada but there's a

00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,870
problem after 700 years those old Oak

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:34,070
timber started to rot a little bit I

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:35,870
needed to be replaced and in the year

00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,750
2000 were you going to find an old oak

00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:42,200
forest that you can easily chop down to

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:43,970
build a new timber the planer the

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,460
builders of the chapel had already

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,540
thought about this they planted acorns

00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,990
when they built the chapel

00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,880
they knew that 700 years from now when

00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,620
they needed to replace the beams they

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,060
would now be oak trees just outside the

00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,750
chapel or at least they hoped that

00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:02,200
nobody cut them down in the interim the

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:04,010
chapel builders valued their

00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,930
construction materials and their

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,930
workmanship and planned for the future

00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:16,760
so we need to talk about values values

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:21,830
are the core belief and desires that

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:23,300
guide an organization or a project often

00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,490
when you ask what makes a great leader

00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,390
strong values is a common response

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:31,550
values can be principles or standards

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:34,520
Service Above Self is the motto for for

00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:36,080
rotary as the values that they have they

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,870
can be intrinsic qualities and Stephen

00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:43,330
forgive me but I'm adding some for moose

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,330
it's correct concise fast in that order

00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:49,370
they can be character traits well it

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:51,920
organized enthusiastic or open they

00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:54,830
could be formal codes of conduct or

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,480
ethics like the Hippocratic oath or the

00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:00,860
Ten Commandments or the Boy Scouts

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,600
outdoor code the questions I brought up

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:08,360
earlier are to help you think about what

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:10,880
your core values are Boy Scouts of

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,970
America have from very familiar very

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,950
straightforward core values on my honor

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,260
I will do my best to do my duty to God

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,450
in my country to help other people at

00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,130
all times to keep myself physically

00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:24,200
strong mentally awake and morally

00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:28,040
straight and a scout is trustworthy

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,830
loyal helpful friendly courteous kind

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,230
obedient cheerful thrifty brave clean

00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,370
and reverent I have to look it up

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:39,350
because I'm only used to saying that

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:41,180
with groups of other people people know

00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,910
these these are tried and true they've

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:46,580
been the mottos for a hundred and eight

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:51,170
hundred and what do we had a hundred and

00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:53,510
nine years of scouting these same mottos

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,890
are pretty much Universal in the world

00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,960
scouting movement they come from the

00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:59,330
ones that the baden-powell

00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,580
wrote for the the initial Scouts and

00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,690
every all of the sixty members of the

00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,880
world scouting movement have some

00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:09,590
variation of those the Girl Scouts have

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,420
them they're pretty Universal and did

00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,790
some googling around last time I gave

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,860
this talk I found the values for Drupal

00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,380
how many people know Drupal content

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,880
management system Drupal lists their

00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,860
values on their website their

00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,779
flexibility simplicity and utility in

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,910
our product teamwork innovation

00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:28,100
and openness in our community modularity

00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:30,290
extensibility and maintainability in our

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,430
code that's pretty simple and

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,430
straightforward that's pretty easy

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:41,089
what are pearls values when I started

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:45,550
doing this I thought it would be easy

00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:48,439
I thought about obviously Tim toady

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:51,949
there's more one way to do it which is

00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:53,809
flexibility Stephens bicarbonate

00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:57,920
but sometimes consistency is not a bad

00:16:53,809 --> 00:17:00,199
thing either I also thought about the

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,499
the three traits of programmers

00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:07,730
impatience laziness and hubris laziness

00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:08,780
in patients in hubris we have a

00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,799
tradition of backwards compatibility

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:16,760
that Sora was complaining about earlier

00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:17,809
that kind of just laziness though I mean

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,250
we just don't want to have to rewrite

00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:21,250
the scripts we wrote thirty years ago

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:29,419
but we have these values but they're not

00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:31,039
really written down they're written down

00:17:29,419 --> 00:17:32,899
but they're not really documented as our

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,000
core values we don't really have an

00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:37,250
organization that says this is who we

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,140
are we don't communicate them very well

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:43,039
but we do have them and they're strong

00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:45,289
and we have them in the community I

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:50,780
think we should work on communicating

00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:54,429
them better next is mission mission is

00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:56,899
why the project exists mission is a

00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:59,419
calling to achieve a long term objective

00:17:56,899 --> 00:18:04,130
or at least a long enough term objective

00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:06,049
that you can finish the project missions

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,340
are often blatantly documented companies

00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:08,780
and organizations are encouraged to

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,929
spend a lot of time thinking up and

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:16,100
writing down mission statements missions

00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:17,659
should line up with your core values the

00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,730
Boy Scouts of America mission statement

00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:21,080
it's on their website the mission of the

00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,549
Boy Scouts of America is to prepare

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,169
young people to make ethical and moral

00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:26,270
choices over their lifetimes by

00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:29,480
instilling in them values of the Scout

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,899
Oath and law we will instill in our

00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,260
people the values that we think are good

00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:35,260
that's our mission

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,710
drupal Drupal's mission is to build the

00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,810
best open source content management

00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,180
framework one that represents the newest

00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:47,010
ideas and best practices and community

00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,140
publishing knowledge management and

00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,450
software design we believe in open

00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:55,500
source innovation globalism and

00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:57,330
collaboration it's pretty pretty solid

00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,360
pretty straightforward this is why we're

00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,360
here

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:07,620
emissions may not be so clearly defined

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:09,720
bender how many people are on IRC and no

00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,890
bender from IRC how many people who know

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,960
bender from when I wrote him the first

00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:19,950
time benders an IRC robot I wrote him

00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:22,710
back in 2003 2004 because I wanted to

00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:25,470
learn Poe specifically I wanted to learn

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:28,290
asynchronous programming and IRC BOTS

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,780
was a really simple way to do that so

00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:35,640
his initial mission statement was teach

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:39,060
Peregrine Poe he did it mostly by

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:43,110
shouting - who would people on IRC and

00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:44,670
then about 2006 early 2007 Matt trout

00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:47,490
came to me and said hey you need to look

00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:49,620
at this mousse thing and so I went and I

00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,480
learned mousse and benders mission

00:19:49,620 --> 00:20:00,060
changed from teach Peregrine Coe to

00:19:51,480 --> 00:20:05,340
teach Peregrine mousse he yeah he's lazy

00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:07,170
now he's gotten old and crusty we found

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,380
out though that people wanted him to be

00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:12,690
ops I needed services and so his mission

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,910
moved from teach Peregrine stuff to

00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:18,180
teach Peregrine stuff and help out on

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:20,760
IRC a little bit and then it is he

00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,680
became better evolved we've got services

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,020
now and you can make your own ops mostly

00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,060
if you know how to pass me to go and fix

00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,910
things behind the scenes and so now

00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:33,560
benders entire mission is hang around

00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,560
and be the leader of the hooter p.m.

00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,620
yeah

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:43,380
missions can change they can evolve as

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,330
the project evolves as you accomplish or

00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:49,980
obsolete some goals you can embrace new

00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,980
ones it's okay

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:56,490
Bender's a great example of that he's

00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,490
also my best project cuz he got me a job

00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:05,470
my first telecommute job so here's the

00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:08,370
problem that I think Sawyer was pointing

00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:12,429
out earlier with with with Pearl

00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:15,640
permissionless we don't really have any

00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:20,140
single body that can determine a mission

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:22,630
for us we're a language that's great but

00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,660
what's the purpose of our language who

00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:32,520
determines that go they have a mission

00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:32,520
make Google run fast what's our mission

00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:42,130
and in larger open-source community

00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:45,970
we're starting to find that the problem

00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:48,490
that Redis is having with Amazon is that

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,559
their mission as a company doesn't line

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,260
up with their values of open source and

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,970
freedom and so they're trying to change

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,760
their values to line up with their

00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:01,210
mission and I'm sure Vicky would be

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:06,340
yelling adamantly about how stupid that

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:11,049
is so kind of in the entire community

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:13,450
we're having these problems what we

00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:16,530
don't have is a mission and what we need

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:21,299
to have with the mission is a vision a

00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:23,590
vision is a picture of future success in

00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:27,309
wood badge they have a video at this

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:29,890
point of this talk and I didn't have the

00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:31,150
technology really with me especially at

00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,040
3:30 in the morning when my plane

00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,330
finally landed to try and hunt out the

00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,000
video and get it all embedded and

00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:40,179
working but it's a clip that's a very

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,480
famous clip it starts in 1962 John F

00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:45,549
Kennedy in a speech he says we choose to

00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,200
go to the moon we choose to go to the

00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:49,510
moon we choose to go to the moon in this

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,220
decade and do the other things not

00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,350
because they are easy

00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,300
but because they are hard because that

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,130
goal will serve to organize and measure

00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,040
the best of our energies and skills

00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:02,050
because that challenge is the one that

00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,630
we are willing to accept one we are

00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:07,660
unwilling to postpone and one we intend

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:09,400
to win and others too it's a great

00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,580
speech if you ever get a chance go look

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,320
up the the will go to the moon speech he

00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,730
says that within a decade we're going to

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:20,620
land a man on the moon and return him

00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:24,100
safely did we do it within that decade

00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:26,110
huh a Stanley Cooper actually the movie

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:34,150
came out in 1967 they were shocked at

00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:35,740
how accurate they were with the moon the

00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:38,290
next year another speech was given

00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,990
that's probably one of the best vision

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:43,480
statements of all time

00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:46,930
1963 August 28th Martin Luther King gave

00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,940
a speech at the water the Lincoln

00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:50,380
Memorial in Washington DC that starts

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,970
out with well it doesn't start out with

00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,240
I have a dream but the part everybody

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,710
remembers is I have a dream it's

00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:01,590
probably one of the best vision

00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:04,030
statements ever did he achieve his goal

00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,850
it's a mixed bag we're still working on

00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:09,880
it but it's a vision that people can see

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:12,630
and can subscribe to it was well

00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,630
communicated

00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:20,540
the Boy Scouts of America lays out their

00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,390
vision statement in an official vision

00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:25,340
state because they're very corporate the

00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:27,020
Boy Scouts of America will prepare every

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,510
eligible youth in America to become a

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,040
responsible participating citizen and a

00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,740
leader who is guided by the Scout Oath

00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,480
and law you see how it lines up with

00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,940
their values and how it lines up with

00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:41,810
their mission their vision is every

00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:44,350
youth will become trained and led by the

00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:47,600
Scout Oath law led by the same values

00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:49,700
that's a very clear vision is it

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,320
achievable no because I know a lot of

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,780
people who don't enjoy Scouts and that's

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,300
fine it's not for everybody but I like

00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:59,510
it my kids love it you know I think it's

00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:06,500
a good program but it's as clear and

00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:11,090
strong vision how many people have heard

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:12,770
of the long now project long now project

00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,230
is setting out to make a ten thousand

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:18,230
year clock they're pretty far along

00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:20,330
actually from what I understand they're

00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:24,440
building a clock in the desert it's

00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:25,450
going to chime every year for ten

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:31,420
thousand years

00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:33,950
they even got Brian Eno to compose a

00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:37,430
generator to make ten thousand years

00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,510
worth of unique chimes that's some

00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,550
serious vision

00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:42,200
that's some serious long distance

00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,210
thinking and they're well on their way

00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,550
of achieving it you can go and tour the

00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:51,290
the clock facility and it's supposed to

00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:52,730
be an amazing feat of Engineering I only

00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,530
have so much time in my life right now

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,340
and I just saw the Spruce Goose so my

00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,340
head is really full

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,670
what's pearls vision Sawyer gave and

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,400
this is where he accused him of ruining

00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:10,710
my talk gave a really good clear kind of

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:15,080
vision of what he saw this morning and I

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:17,220
took these notes during his talk he

00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,650
started with clearing a clear definition

00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,320
of a core team on a steering committee

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,790
so we have people to help us figure out

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,550
what our mission and our objectives and

00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:28,050
our goals are he asked for more

00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,900
leadership to help with corporate needs

00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:33,990
and he had a laundry list of projects he

00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,460
wanted to see contributed to technical

00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:40,230
things that we could do social things

00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:42,210
that we could do but his vision it's a

00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:45,870
bit like the old story about the blind

00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:48,000
men and the elephant what he saw was

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:51,360
from his perspective and the laundry

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,540
list of things he had were only the

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,830
pieces that he could see as pumpkin he

00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,430
started out with a really great

00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:01,820
technical list but it's a technical list

00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:04,110
our problems aren't technical problems

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:07,490
he followed it up and this is where I

00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:10,080
got frustrated with social issues and

00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:12,150
those are good social issues with the

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,720
core of all of that is we have a serious

00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,720
lack of leadership

00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:26,640
but it's not a new problem we've been

00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:28,170
having this problem for my entire time

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,170
as a developer I was renting it some

00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:33,630
people in the hallway earlier I'm old

00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:36,500
enough to remember when Perl was going

00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:39,990
to die because PHP was taking over and

00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:42,090
we had to be more like Java to combat

00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,830
that and oh crap job is gonna kill us

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,110
because it's becoming popular too fast

00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,430
and we're not object-oriented enough or

00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:50,220
we're not structured enough or we're not

00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:54,350
whatever and Oh PHP is already stolen

00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:57,420
the buck we're all gonna die and then

00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:59,790
five years later Ruby Ruby's gonna kill

00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,970
us it's all over Ruby's come about

00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:04,800
Ruby's doing with pearl did but better

00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:11,790
we've lost we've lost piers he's gone

00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:15,600
off to Ruby nodejs nodejs has NPM

00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:17,250
they've got Java scripts there they can

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,400
run in both the browser and the back and

00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:22,050
we're screwed node.js is gonna kill us

00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:25,590
now the current kickin boy it's really

00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:27,810
deeply ironic Perl 6 Perl 6 is going to

00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:31,890
kill us it happens to be the one

00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:35,070
language that Larry also wrote but we've

00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,870
been having this fight for 20 years Perl

00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,510
6 isn't going to kill us we're going to

00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:41,820
kill us because we keep focusing on what

00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,680
other other people are doing with the

00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:51,390
community is doing and what the culture

00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:53,100
is doing and to be honest the Perl 6

00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:55,530
community is showing signs of adopting

00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,180
this exact same paranoia I'm almost

00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:04,290
positive that's not a feature Larry

00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:06,980
wanted to port across so we've been

00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,980
doing this for a while

00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:13,790
well we need to understand is that

00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:16,160
change happens I said earlier that we

00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:19,100
were in a Chinese proverb in the world

00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,170
of open-source is changing and pearls

00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,810
place in it is changing we're not gonna

00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:26,210
be the only solution other than C to

00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:30,350
write CGI n it's not gonna happen

00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:32,660
that's been dead for 20 years huh - we

00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,310
could do bash yeah no um you get

00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:42,440
everybody in there to go convert to bash

00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:46,820
and I'll back you on that black in wood

00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:49,360
badge they have six steps to dealing

00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:52,400
with change in an organization one

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:56,660
recognize the change happens understand

00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,130
that you have a problem to empower

00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,930
others to help you lead the change

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,760
that's what Surya was trying to do this

00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,710
morning with his call-out it's trying to

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,070
get other people to try and help it's

00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:09,310
part of why I'm here lead the change

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:11,540
based on the values mission and vision

00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:14,000
well they're starting to have some

00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:18,110
trouble we don't know what our mission

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,060
our vision is it's complicated establish

00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,450
urgency well know we've got the urgency

00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,620
down

00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:27,890
we've been panicking for 20 years move

00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:32,030
ahead regardless well we're doing that

00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:33,530
because the world is forcing us to but

00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,570
as soya also pointed out this morning

00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:40,130
it's good to take a moment to pause and

00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:42,890
think and plan we need to establish a

00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:45,440
culture that embraces change that's

00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:49,160
where we really have some troubles and

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,660
issues we're embracing change but is

00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,280
being forced on a lot of us and what we

00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:56,240
need to have is leadership that helps

00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:58,010
all of our members be comfortable with

00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,600
the change or embrace the change or

00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,160
guide that forward we need to

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,800
communicate the vision clearly of where

00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,900
we're trying to go we need to come up

00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,970
with a mission for the community for

00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,290
Pearl we need to communicate that

00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:13,700
clearly and make sure that everybody is

00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:16,340
on board and understands that we're good

00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:19,070
at some of these six things we're

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,240
atrocious at others the really really

00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:21,559
ironic part is the

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:27,019
ones that were good at and the ones that

00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:28,519
were stuck at changed constantly and if

00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:30,619
you're bad at any of them you end up

00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:34,159
with some serious conflicts which

00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:35,360
sawyers the email box can show you see I

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:41,419
liked having you in here because I can

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:45,529
use you as an example now there's a

00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:47,690
Norman Rockwell painting I had to go and

00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:50,869
find an image of it on the Internet

00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:52,940
this is a cropped down version it's

00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:55,990
called the Scoutmaster as you can see

00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:58,820
it's a starlit anoint a starlit night

00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:01,730
the Scoutmaster who's kind of a cross

00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:04,669
between Cary Grant and and John Wayne is

00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:07,759
standing there and the embers of the

00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:11,899
campfire contemplating the serene and

00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:17,539
satisfied world all the tents are laid

00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:20,389
out perfectly he seems confident and

00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:22,970
everything he's doing the problem is

00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:26,320
that Rockwell painted this and he didn't

00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:28,249
capture the time when the Scoutmaster

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,860
discovered that nobody had packed the

00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:35,119
tents happened on one of our camp outs

00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,470
luckily the leaders had their tents and

00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,480
the kids slept in the leaders tents and

00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:40,249
I have a lovely picture of my co-leader

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,070
sleeping under the tarp that I happen to

00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:45,139
have had with me they don't have the

00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:47,389
picture of the cub master who's dealing

00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:50,210
with the parents who are upset because

00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:53,869
the software for the Pinewood Derby

00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:58,389
crashed halfway through the race not

00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:58,389
saying who did that but it's fixed now

00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:03,609
they're not talking there's no painting

00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:05,710
of the venture crew advisor who's

00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:07,659
dealing with six kids who won't speak to

00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:12,399
each other on the very first day of a

00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:18,580
two-week campout 14 year olds are

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:20,619
Hardman leadership is super easy when

00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:25,989
everything is going well and everybody's

00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:28,840
asleep most of the rest of the time

00:33:25,989 --> 00:33:31,330
leadership involves managing conflict

00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,950
and finding common ground providing

00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,779
tools for people to settle their own

00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:37,090
disputes and on rare occasions stepping

00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:38,769
in to make ulama lateral decisions this

00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:41,109
is a place where I think lawyer Sawyer

00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:42,849
actually excels and has done a very good

00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:51,599
job at and I want to give him credit for

00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:54,460
that first up be aware of yourself a

00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,019
Scoutmaster nagged his Scouts at every

00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,389
campout to get dinner ready so that they

00:33:56,019 --> 00:34:00,340
could eat at a reasonable time after the

00:33:58,389 --> 00:34:02,830
third or fourth campout he stopped and

00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:06,190
asked himself why was he doing this why

00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:08,109
would who would sign up for that when he

00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,730
was honest with himself he realized the

00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:11,559
only reason he was nagging them was

00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:14,409
because he was getting hungry and grumpy

00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:18,849
and hangry the portmanteau we were

00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:20,740
taught earlier and that that it was

00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:23,319
because he was feeling bad so on the

00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:26,399
next campout he secretly packed a snack

00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:28,210
for himself and while the kids were busy

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,889
procrastinating and goofing off when he

00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:31,599
would normally go and yell at them to

00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:34,540
start getting dinner ready he snuck off

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:40,950
for some quiet time and had ate a snack

00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:45,179
and he came back and eventually

00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:48,849
eventually the scouts got hungry and

00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:49,780
they started fixing dinner and they came

00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:52,480
and invited him to dinner

00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:55,929
and the problem solved itself when he

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,809
took a moment to reflect on his own role

00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:01,000
in the situation he rise that them not

00:34:58,809 --> 00:35:03,309
fixing dinner wasn't a problem him being

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,980
grumpy was the problem he fixed that and

00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:07,299
the rest of the problem solved itself so

00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,670
the first thing you can do in resolving

00:35:07,299 --> 00:35:10,180
a conflict take a look at your own role

00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,069
in the

00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:18,579
make sure that you can be objective

00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:20,650
about yourself the following and then

00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:22,240
the second thing you do ask this

00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:25,000
question of all of the parties involved

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,950
in the conflict what do you want when

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,260
was the last time that you were in a

00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:30,940
discussion on IRC or arguing about

00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,520
technical merits of something and they

00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,349
all stopped and said wait wait wait what

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:41,109
do you want out of this what are you

00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:46,170
trying to achieve what's your goal how

00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:49,539
did you respond after the first question

00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,950
there's some follow-ups what are you

00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:56,140
doing to get what you want

00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:59,140
is that working for you do you want to

00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:01,630
figure out a different way and the order

00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,640
of those is very very important because

00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,380
usually in conversations that I've seen

00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,420
this time and again on p5p in an IRC

00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,130
people ask the first one what do you

00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,510
want and then they go to the last one

00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,779
and they tell them what they can go do

00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,779
with themselves

00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,480
you gotta have the middle ones is this

00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:24,220
change working do we want to try other

00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:26,710
things why are you you know why you

00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,539
can't change other people but you can

00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:31,200
encourage them to work with you to

00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:31,200
change together

00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:39,740
so the future in using the BSA is

00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,510
attempting to expand this mission from

00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:44,510
serving boys to serving every youth in

00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:50,390
every part of its program the reactions

00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:53,390
been mixed some have fully embraced it

00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:54,560
you know volunteered to be assistant

00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,570
scoutmaster another night of the week

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,950
and had to listen to complaints about

00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,420
why you're spending two nights of the

00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:06,380
week out of the house instead of just

00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:10,100
one some not so much they've decided to

00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,690
end long lasting relationships and

00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:15,820
strike off on their own and build their

00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:21,580
own programs others have filed lawsuits

00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:23,870
could be worse the open source community

00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:26,270
we're trying to survive being too

00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:28,160
successful we're trying to survive the

00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:30,740
fact that we've gone bigger and better

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,160
than anybody in the 80s and 90s ever

00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:40,220
imagined we could because open source is

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:42,230
basically eaten in the world and pearls

00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:44,120
position in the open source community is

00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:46,850
changing we need to figure out our

00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,800
vision we need to establish a new

00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,660
mission to get there and we may have to

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,940
adjust some of our values some of the

00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:55,490
things that we hold dear as far as

00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,620
technical solutions and and some of that

00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:58,850
stuff and put some more emphasis on

00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:02,210
other things that we don't think about

00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:03,800
so much like soft skills for lack of a

00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:07,360
better term although there are very hard

00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,360
skills for most of us to deal with

00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:13,130
focusing more on leadership and

00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:16,210
embracing change and making sure that

00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:24,590
everybody is on board and you know

00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:27,800
community building all's not lost the

00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:29,270
challenges it's easy to decide that it's

00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,720
better off to just go do something else

00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:34,340
but we really shouldn't because I want

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,810
to be a part of this community I want to

00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,950
enjoy looking forward to coming to you

00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,510
obviously I want to enjoy looking

00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,600
forward to being on IRC up roll out at

00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,600
work

00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:47,000
and we've been challenged to start

00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:50,510
cleaning up our ecosystem and start

00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:53,690
looking at how we can do a better job so

00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:58,280
let's look at that how are we doing on

00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:59,600
diversity sorry you had some comments

00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:02,480
earlier how do you think we're doing

00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:07,480
from your perspective community wise on

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:10,220
diversity not as good as we should I

00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:14,810
talked about how many people know mark

00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:17,030
Prather my brother he's the officially

00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,860
the TPF community liaison chair or

00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:20,930
something like that

00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,730
he's a scrum master and so he spends all

00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:25,280
of his time thinking about team building

00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:27,170
and community management and project you

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:32,360
know project leadership management and

00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:32,990
coaching his point is we're not doing as

00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,230
well as we should

00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:39,890
we're doing better than some but we're

00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:42,760
not doing as well as we should and for a

00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:48,290
bunch of that's not a bad deal

00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:49,850
he's a little rough we could do he doing

00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:52,040
better we can always be doing better

00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:55,430
so we're laid out some guy some

00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:58,670
objectives this morning we need them not

00:39:55,430 --> 00:40:02,360
only because bringing in new people and

00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:05,330
being more inclusive and diverse will

00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,680
grow our user base but because we need

00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:08,930
to restart replacing the leaders that

00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,810
are leaving so we need to start

00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:13,880
embracing diversity and we need to start

00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:16,100
dealing with the blind man and the

00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,350
elephant problem we can't just go with

00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,140
with soy vision on everything although

00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:24,020
he would love that

00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:26,180
no you he's too good

00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,490
we can't just go with one person's

00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:29,510
vision on everything we have to to come

00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:31,100
up with a solution that works for

00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:37,270
everybody because otherwise we'd all end

00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:40,370
up with Israelis running everything um

00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:43,930
not just later on Israelis just dis

00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,930
light on Sawyer to be honest

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,810
we need to establish better coaching and

00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:53,980
mentoring how many people know the

00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:59,320
difference between coaching and

00:40:53,980 --> 00:41:00,840
mentoring not enough hands went up so

00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:05,680
you get to hear it

00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:07,300
coaching is a coach a coach is a person

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,240
who develops skills and capabilities in

00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,650
another person or a team of people

00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,040
coaching is often a formal relationship

00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:17,200
they'll provide Direction vision skill

00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:19,150
skill instruction resources and as the

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,650
individual team becomes more productive

00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:25,090
they'll step back and start enabling a

00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:27,550
mentor is a much more personal and

00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:30,670
informal role a mentor is a trusted

00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:32,170
guide or counselor it's often it often

00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,810
is more than skill training and may

00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,100
become a very personal relationship

00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:37,420
mentors may be assigned in a more formal

00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:40,630
relationship but it often occurs

00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:42,520
naturally they help a person understand

00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:47,560
the culture and environment the reasons

00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:49,660
why not just how but why they help

00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,630
retain an increase engagement with the

00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:55,720
mentored individuals we don't have

00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:57,940
enough of either of these and as I just

00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:01,390
pointed out I happen to be very close

00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:04,390
with a parallel community that's very

00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:06,280
good at some of these we need to start

00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:08,710
embracing the scrum masters and the

00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,390
agile coaches and the project managers

00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,920
that we have at work and start

00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:14,920
introducing them to hey we have this

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,530
open source project over here and we're

00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:20,220
doing really badly at organizing can you

00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:23,080
come help coach and train us and help I

00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,250
know from experience that they would

00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,359
love to do that because otherwise

00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,490
they're all sitting around at lean

00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:33,240
coffees complaining about their jobs to

00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:39,450
each other we should do more of that and

00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:42,070
as an example oh I have my slides out

00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:45,640
I'm gonna do this out of order last

00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:47,200
minute change as an example assessments

00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,109
how many people here have done 360

00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,060
assessments or something for work how

00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:54,790
many people absolutely load 360

00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:55,880
assessments and stuff for work we're

00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:58,940
doing the wrong

00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,620
assessments should be great there are

00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:04,790
way for us to get feedback which is the

00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:06,110
next slide last line whatever um they're

00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,730
a way for us to get feedback and

00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:09,680
direction and understanding about well

00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,850
how well we're moving towards

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,950
accomplishing our goals and our vision

00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:16,520
and our mission how well we're seeing

00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:20,960
true to our values there's a great

00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:23,230
example in in this wood badge where they

00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,620
talk about how to set up a 360

00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:31,760
evaluation that's fair and and easy and

00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:34,160
kind step one go and find yourself a

00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,750
facilitator facilitator is a fancy word

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,770
for call mark and ask him to help you

00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:42,350
then you sit down and you come up with a

00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:48,470
question a series of questions how am i

00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:50,390
doing on XYZ your goals the the the

00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:53,840
goals that the questions you ask should

00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:57,200
be smart tasks I don't even know smart

00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:59,750
the acronym specific measurable

00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,300
attainable relevant and time-based how

00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:03,860
well am i doing on these tasks or these

00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:08,180
goals that you care about for the

00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:11,180
project develop a survey with your

00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:13,340
facilitator and then with your

00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:16,490
facilitator come up with ten people that

00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:18,620
you can send that survey to and not just

00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,730
10 people like the people directly under

00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,130
you that you have to work with day to

00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,450
day but 10 people in the entire

00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,590
community the people that are direct

00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:28,520
stakeholders the people that are

00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:30,410
secondary stakeholders ten people send

00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:33,710
them the survey and have them send that

00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:36,020
to your facilitator you'll never see the

00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:38,840
actual results so it can be anonymous

00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:40,790
and anonymized they all send it to mark

00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:43,070
and then mark will go through it and

00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:47,180
he'll come to you with the feedback from

00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:50,990
the collected 360 list it's a good task

00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:56,590
for agile coaches as a first task to do

00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:59,870
and that gets us to to feedback

00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:05,660
feedbacks a gift this is a very common

00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:07,970
phrase in the scouting movement but it

00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:10,610
can be a complicated one I'm sure people

00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:14,870
have been on IRC or p5p or other mailing

00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:21,890
lists and in seen feedback that was less

00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:23,180
than useful so if you're giving feedback

00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,370
if you're in a position where you're

00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:27,530
trying to give feedback to somebody step

00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:29,930
one consider yourself like we said

00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:32,270
earlier make sure that the feedback that

00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:36,080
you're giving isn't because you're

00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:39,890
pissed off it's because you actually

00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:41,780
want to motivate change find out if the

00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:45,470
other people involved are actually open

00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:47,810
to that change sometimes some people may

00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:50,390
not be ready to make the changes you're

00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:52,640
requesting that's okay

00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:55,310
you move on and you figure out a way you

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:58,970
know another solution or sometimes

00:45:55,310 --> 00:46:00,920
they're open to that change only give

00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:03,110
feedback only deal with things that can

00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,910
actually be changed where there's this

00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:07,100
is a problem here's a potential solution

00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:09,920
there's an actual change here don't just

00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:11,960
say Perl needs to be better well what

00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,780
does better mean what it pro needs to be

00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:19,250
you know more popular that's not

00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:22,160
something that we can control deal with

00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:28,310
specifics not generalities Popular's to

00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:31,550
general describe the behavior that needs

00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:33,050
to be changed but don't and this is the

00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:37,190
key that we really have a problem with

00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:40,100
but don't evaluate it don't say you're

00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:42,020
doing this and it's bad say you're doing

00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:47,660
this and I think we should change to do

00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:49,460
this use an i statement to accept

00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:54,470
responsibility for your own perceptions

00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:59,270
and emotions I feel this way I have a

00:46:54,470 --> 00:47:00,470
problem here I you know and make sure

00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:02,270
the recipients of the feedback have

00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:04,310
heard and understood you get them to

00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:07,940
repeat it back make sure that you're

00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:11,240
both on the same page and if you're

00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:13,190
receiving feedback one go look for it

00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,990
do assessments go and ask people hey how

00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,980
am i doing hey how are we doing hey

00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:19,109
how's this going

00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,160
every troop meeting has or every patrol

00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:22,440
meeting and every troop meeting

00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,640
especially would badge has a moment

00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,130
where they do what's called a start stop

00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,750
continue or roses and thorns or there's

00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:29,880
another number of different words for it

00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:32,130
but it's very quick hey what are we

00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,410
doing that we shouldn't be doing hey

00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:38,190
what are we doing that is working really

00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:39,780
well we should continue doing and what

00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:45,300
are things that we haven't done yet that

00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:47,160
we should try if you're receiving

00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,420
feedback listen carefully make sure that

00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,820
you're understanding use active

00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,560
listening pay attention really think

00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:54,450
make sure that you understand if you

00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:58,619
have an opportunity repeat back to the

00:47:54,450 --> 00:48:00,060
person what they said limpet listen

00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,160
empathetically put yourself in their

00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,660
shoes understand hey they're frustrated

00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,240
enough to come to you and tell you

00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:08,430
something they have a you know or

00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,869
they're caring enough they're interested

00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,190
enough that they want to come and give

00:48:09,869 --> 00:48:13,500
you suggestions for something that's

00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:15,210
amazing respect that listen

00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:19,350
empathetically understand it from their

00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:23,100
perspective and then notice how you feel

00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:27,420
when someone offers feedback if you're

00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:29,100
the the neurology talked this morning

00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,900
that is a good one

00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:33,270
that whoomp understand your own feelings

00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:35,280
hack your own brains that you're aware

00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,900
and objective about how you're receiving

00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,070
the feedback and understand if you're

00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:42,570
upset that's not the messengers problem

00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:44,960
that's your problem and you need to cope

00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:44,960
with that

00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,440
which brings us all into

00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:54,760
servant-leadership the whole course of

00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,880
wood badge is about servant leadership

00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,349
in the 1970s Robert Greenleaf introduced

00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,780
the term servant leadership and it's

00:48:59,349 --> 00:49:03,130
really blossomed since then I personally

00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:06,099
never heard of it until I went to wood

00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:09,160
badge for the first time servant

00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:15,520
leadership encourages the leaders to

00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:17,590
serve their community to do stay focused

00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,510
on achieving results in line with the

00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:22,060
the organization but your job is really

00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:26,080
to enable the group to achieve the goals

00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:29,940
not to force the group to you know lead

00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,940
change the goals or to achieve the goals

00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:35,920
servant leadership isn't easy walking

00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:37,660
from the back and making sure that all

00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,400
of the kids stay in a row and get to

00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:41,260
where they're supposed to go especially

00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:45,070
during summer camp and especially during

00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:47,020
mealtime is really hard but it's

00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:48,430
important it's important to stay back

00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:50,650
and enable because that's the only way

00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:53,290
the community builds new learning and

00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:55,530
new growth and and becomes better on

00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,530
their own

00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:02,020
finally legacies my grandfather was an

00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,690
Eagle Scout

00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:08,170
my father was an Eagle Scout my brother

00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:10,180
is an Eagle Scout I dropped out which is

00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:13,869
why of course now I'm standing here in a

00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:17,170
uniform talking to you guys I recently

00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:19,119
inherited my grandfather's library of

00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:21,580
scouting material I have handbooks of

00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,750
scouting for boys handbooks from 1920's

00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:25,150
1930's

00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:26,410
they're incredible material they're just

00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:28,359
fascinating the way they thought about

00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:33,369
leadership and training and youth and

00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:34,510
whatnot and I had the opportunity when I

00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:36,460
went through wood badge the first time

00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:37,869
to attend with my dad my dad had

00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,280
actually technically never gone through

00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:40,900
wood badge and is one of his friends

00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,330
said you've never done this before Dave

00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:45,609
you've done everything I said he said no

00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:50,080
I hadn't and we went together and it was

00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:53,109
a lot of fun one of the things that my

00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:54,280
dad has said struck me and I find it

00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:56,770
coming out of my mouth and my son

00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,359
regularly the only reason my dad stayed

00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:00,670
in Scouting and achieved eagle was

00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:01,500
because when he was younger his dad kept

00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:03,570
saying

00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:05,520
going to scouts are you coming didn't

00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:08,190
give him an option they were just going

00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:11,700
to Scouts and it just became routine my

00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:14,370
grandfather left a legacy with my dad

00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:16,200
that my brother and I and now his

00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:17,970
great-grandson that he's never met and

00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,240
will never meet cuz he passed away in

00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:23,910
the 90s that's the legacy he's leaving

00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:26,400
behind the builders of that chapel in

00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:28,890
Cambridge thought about their legacy and

00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,960
they made plans and incorporated into

00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:32,310
their vision they thought about what the

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:39,360
future generations were going to be

00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:42,210
doing we need to be doing the same good

00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:44,490
leaders put those as they lead first

00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:45,840
they take care of their team first they

00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:50,700
make sure that the team is taken care of

00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:52,170
first the most effective application of

00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:54,390
this philosophy requires both the leader

00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:57,360
and the team to understand and apply

00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:58,980
reciprocal responsibilities the leaders

00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,750
need to know what their responsibilities

00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:03,990
are as far as setting goals and vision

00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:05,130
and communicating that clearly the team

00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,540
members need to understand their

00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:09,150
responsibilities in achieving and

00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:10,170
working together to achieve that and

00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:11,400
they both need to understand their

00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:16,050
responsibilities as far as clear

00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:18,740
communication from both sides values

00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:21,330
mission vision they can all change

00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:24,320
that's fine as long as everybody

00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:28,370
understands how those changes work

00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,370
everybody's on board in the same place

00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:33,930
which leads to the greatest leadership

00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:37,650
secret they tell this the very last day

00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:41,400
they have this very secret you know this

00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:43,020
very well done presentation about the

00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,160
leadership secret I can't do that whole

00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,080
presents like an hour-long presentation

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,370
right after lunch so everybody's fallen

00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,580
asleep and they manage to keep us all

00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:52,740
awake it's beautiful it's really well

00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:55,980
done I use it to this day

00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:57,060
parts of it but at the end of it they

00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:02,670
tell you what the greatest leadership

00:52:57,060 --> 00:53:05,610
secret is it's very easy it's very

00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:06,720
common everybody knows it it's do unto

00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:11,770
others which you would have them do unto

00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:13,360
you it's the golden rule but

00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:15,610
thing that the take away that they have

00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:18,430
that I hadn't heard before is by a man

00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:20,950
named Frank crane as the golden rule is

00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:23,880
of no use whatsoever unless you

00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:26,890
understand it's your move

00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:31,810
it's your job to do unto others it's

00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:39,160
your turn which is where I'm gonna leave

00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:41,770
it I'm Kris Prather I'm peregrine what

00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:52,770
do you guys want your legacy to be thank
