Publication date: 2019-06-19

Description: 
	Having completed a scouting leadership challenge has given me better insight in how to be a team or community leader. In this talk we'll explore the high level overview of the BSA's Wood Badge Leadership training and how it can apply to managing an open source community.
We will cover:
- Establishing Vision and Values
- Bringing the Vision to Life
- Team Development Models
- Conflict Solving and Decision Making
- Leaving a Legacy

There will be no spoilers and due to restrictions by the hotel no s'mores.
