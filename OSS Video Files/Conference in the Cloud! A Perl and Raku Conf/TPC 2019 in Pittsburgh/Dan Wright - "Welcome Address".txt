we have an accessibility team run by Don

00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:32,210
Wallace

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:34,699
so if Don did you have anything that you

00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,800
wanted to say right now no okay

00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,449
well Don will be heading up our

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,020
accessibility team there are there is

00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:44,080
information about accessibility on the

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,400
website and should you have any

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,569
accessibility needs

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,360
there is information on the website

00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:52,370
about how to get in touch with us and we

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,449
are going to do our best to make sure

00:04:52,370 --> 00:05:01,219
that everybody has an amazing conference

00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:05,060
also this year we've added sched so TP

00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:07,069
CIP sched comm is our scheduling app

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:11,060
that we're using there is a mobile app

00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:13,669
that you can download and you can log in

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,069
and you know kind of create your own

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:18,680
schedule for the week of the sessions

00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:20,719
that you plan to attend and then at the

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,870
end of each session scheduled will give

00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:25,879
you the ability to provide feedback for

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,800
that particular course directly through

00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:34,400
the app and then that information will

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:42,520
get shared with the speakers tonight we

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:49,340
have our our mixer that starts at 6 p.m.

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:51,229
and the idea here is I personally think

00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:56,479
that one of pearls biggest strengths is

00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:58,520
the community and I I've been with all

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,210
of you for a long time and I know that

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,789
you are a really warm and welcoming

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,839
group but we do have some people in here

00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:08,300
that maybe this is their first

00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,969
conference maybe they haven't been fully

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,889
exposed to the Perl community yet and so

00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:15,589
we want to give them a chance to get to

00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:17,719
know everybody and so 6 o'clock tonight

00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:21,560
we're gonna have a mixer and we put out

00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:25,310
ask me about stickers at the front desk

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,520
and the idea is that if you are an

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,789
individual that wants to strike up a

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,659
strike up a conversation with somebody

00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:37,699
or identify yourself as somebody that is

00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:41,089
welcoming to new people to come up and

00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:43,430
talk to you put on a sticker and write

00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:45,050
something in there that you enjoy

00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:48,680
talking about it can be anything you

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,330
want a pearl topic a hobby whatever just

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,180
give you that so that's a way to

00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:57,199
indicate to other people that you're

00:06:53,180 --> 00:07:00,669
you're absolutely open to striking up a

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,669
conversation and meeting some new people

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:10,999
tomorrow night we will be going on our

00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:15,199
social event of the conference we will

00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:18,050
be on the Gateway clipper fleet the the

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,919
Duchess liner that's a picture of it

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:24,710
there will be a buffet dinner of course

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:28,639
we'll have we'll have vegan options

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:33,110
available as well as entrees for the the

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:35,240
meat eaters amongst us the this will the

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,189
boarding will take place at 7 p.m.

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,439
over its Station Square which is across

00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:43,249
the river it's about a mile mile and a

00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:45,349
half from here we do we will wrap up

00:07:43,249 --> 00:07:48,259
talks around 6:00 and we're gonna need

00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:50,509
everybody to be over there by 7:00 so to

00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:54,830
begin the boarding process and the the

00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:56,389
boat will launch around 7:30 but I can

00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,550
tell you with absolute certainty that

00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:01,580
once they push off they're not coming

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:06,680
back so you need to be there before 7:30

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:09,620
or you're not getting on the boat if you

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,749
brought somebody with you that is not

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,240
part of the conference and you are

00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:18,889
interested in bringing a plus-one with

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:21,860
you to to the cruise tomorrow we we

00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:24,560
totally welcome that we want everybody

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,409
to have a great time the the only thing

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,199
that we have to be conscious of is the

00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:32,870
number of people getting on the boat and

00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,060
therefore there is a limit to how many

00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,069
people we can put on the boat and so

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,430
what we are going to ask is that if you

00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:41,930
are bringing if you're if you're coming

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,310
you should have already let autumn know

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,769
at the front desk that that's the case

00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,690
if you didn't say yes I'm coming but

00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:49,870
then you decide later on oh yeah I do

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,949
want to come please come let us know

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,720
it's it's not like we're gonna be like

00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:55,550
checking registrations or anything at

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,560
the boat but we really need to have a

00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,810
good sense of how many people are coming

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,029
and part of that is because if you are

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,730
bringing a plus-one we'd also like you

00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:06,589
to come talk to autumn and and let let

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,949
her know if you're bringing a plus-one

00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:12,260
and we will accept those plus ones for

00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:15,650
as long as there is space on the boat

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:19,000
so it's first come first serve if you

00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:22,610
want to bring a plus-one let autumn know

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,240
so getting to Station Square is pretty

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:29,300
simple there is actually a map and

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,740
information in sched on how to get there

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:35,090
we are going to ask that for those

00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,090
people that are that brought their own

00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:40,550
personal personal vehicles to the event

00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:44,710
to please use your own vehicle to drive

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:48,170
over to Station Square there is also a

00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:51,260
subway station right outside the hotel

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:55,540
which we call the T and you can take the

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,950
T from the hotel to Station Square and

00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,680
it costs two dollars and seventy-five

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,690
cents and they don't make change so try

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,720
to have exact change and if you didn't

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,430
bring exact change we will be making

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,530
change for people tomorrow we have a

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,490
cash box and bring some money and we'll

00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:16,010
make change for you so there is also a

00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:18,290
shuttle that the hotel operates a free

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:22,000
shuttle service it'll go five miles in

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:24,320
any direction from this hotel but there

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,180
we expected there to be about a hundred

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,800
and forty people here at this conference

00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:31,400
and it turns out that there's over a

00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,640
hundred and seventy and we're happy

00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,640
about that

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:41,500
but there's no way we're gonna fit a

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:46,010
hundred and seventy people in one van so

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:50,240
what we are asking is that if you are

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:51,920
not mobility limited in any way that you

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,630
please make use of one of the other

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,930
forms of transportation to get to
