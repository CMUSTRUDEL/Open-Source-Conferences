Title: Nicolas R. - "Overriding Perl OPs With XS"
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	This talk will show how it's possible to mock PerlOps using XS and provide a convenient Pure Perl hook for each of the file check -X.

Overload::FileCheck provides a way to mock one or more file checks. It is also possible to mock stat/lstat functions using "mock_all_from_stat" and let Overload::FileCheck mock for you for any other -X checks.
