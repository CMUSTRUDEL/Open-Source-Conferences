Publication date: 2019-06-20

Description: 
	(Retro) This is my attempt to recreate my original lightning talk from YAPC::19100. It shows how to use Quantum::Superpositions to win the office football pool.

hi so I actually did what I think is the

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,519
very first lightening talk ever done at

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,900
a Yap see which may have been not oh no

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,750
the first lightening talk ever which is

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,480
kind of scary so it was way back that it

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,520
was way back in the AFC 119 100 we were

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,670
all obviously a lot younger than like

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,820
Jim I also did mine on an overhead

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,710
projector with with transparencies

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,720
unlike Jim I think overhead

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,699
transparencies are underrated and they

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,040
actually if you spend enough time sort

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,250
of hanging around like academic math

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,660
departments they're still used and

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,950
they're kind of cool like you can write

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,540
on them while you're giving a talk

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,000
that's pretty cool I once saw someone

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,020
like something to some a woman came to

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,280
do a presentation in her her something

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:53,399
was wrong with her laptop and she was

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:55,350
giving a talk on on oh I'm like totally

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,090
blanking with what they are she she

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,739
didn't have her slides and she wrote

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,480
them all out all sorts of math and

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,070
everything just on a whole bunch of

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,220
transparencies it was pretty amazing so

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:09,869
anyway at the app c-119 100 that was the

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:12,390
first time I met damien Conway and at

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,820
the time he gave a talk on on quantum

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,140
superpositions I know we all use any

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,310
when has anyone used quantum

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,530
superpositions

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,030
maybe ish so let me give a quick rundown

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,000
on how quantum what quantum

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:28,820
superpositions does it gives you two new

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,990
keywords one is any and any is it's

00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,520
technically it's the disjunctive

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,040
superposition of states but that really

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,990
made is a variable that can be any one

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,210
of a number of states so if you have any

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,320
one two three that variable could be one

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,320
or two or three

00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:50,250
it also gives another keyword called all

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,659
which that's a conductive super super

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:57,630
position so it's in all of those states

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:59,700
simultaneously so it's 1 n 2 n 3 and you

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,200
know so it's sort of the idea of the

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,969
electrode of yours cat which was both

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,009
dead and not dead this is the same idea

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,270
but with variables and you can do all

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,459
sorts of interesting things this is from

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,640
the man page you can do these cool sort

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,620
of cross products all in one statement

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,630
I know I know these are actually part of

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,280
pearl six now and so you use them but

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,940
all you pearl six people or you're like

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,710
so what but like back in like like 2000

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,870
I was pretty blown away by that but then

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,990
like as with lots of Damien talk I go

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,950
from this state to like what can I do

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,660
with this and so I got to thinking we

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,580
had I was working in a corporate IT

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,970
department at the time and we have this

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,410
weekly football pool you know where you

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,390
know you have a bunch of team got your

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,850
games and there's a points ready just

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,250
pick who what team you want to win so I

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,980
get to thinking so instead of just

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,180
submitting my picks as like whether I'm

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,280
picking say this Seahawks were the 49ers

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,040
what if I submit my picks as a quantum

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,090
superposition of two different teams so

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:06,840
then you could say so if the winner is

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,430
Steelers then if you check it's it's

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,950
gonna say is it when I lose and if you

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,800
run that it's gonna say you win okay so

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,350
what happens if the winner is the Eagles

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,700
well still it says you win this is

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,440
pretty cool either way you win because

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,600
it doesn't check in till after the game

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,130
has already been played but just to

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,200
prove that it doesn't always work if you

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,269
say that it's like the Browns the Browns

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,790
obviously loses right so this is how

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,959
this is how you can make play the

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,549
audience that's what I always say so

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,430
this is how you can make lots of money

00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:37,000
using Damien's davian's modules so thank

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,370
you very much

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,810
