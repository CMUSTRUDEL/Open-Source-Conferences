Title: Joshua Turcotte - "Perl Activism Through Civic Hacking"
Publication date: 2019-06-18
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	Ultimately, this is very meta to perl; but the idea here is to encourage volunteering time and talent and perl's raw capacity for getting interesting things done, done quickly, and done well toward fixing local socio-economic problems. If the local government isn't up to the task, why shouldn't we do it? Benjamin Franklin did a bit of civic hacking when we got the first volunteer fire department going in Philly, or created and gave away, patent-free, many inventions. Civic hackers here in Arlington and Alexandria helped both the National Science Foundation and the Patent and Trademark Office find 800% more connections between grants and patents for 2012 than they'd been able to do on their own. Civic hackers saved Mexico City the equivalent of several millions of dollars by creating open source applications. Franklin didn't have perl, admittedly, and we used python for the NSF and I suspect perl was not much at place in Mexico City. But it could have been, and should have been... and, honestly, there's so much left to do, from building a pothole tracking application to holding congress's feet to the fire on critical issues like climate change or internal socio-economic policies, and all through data and applications and networking the likes of which perl would be wizardly at. So let's talk about it.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,990
this is my talk it's called pearl

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,120
evangelism through civic hacking and I

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,460
borrow pretty heavily from these peoples

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,710
so this this came about

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,429
basically through some formative years

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,949
where local PD CPM group was starting to

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,840
shrink and it made me think about what

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,250
might be going wrong and these people

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,949
also have seen to have thought similar

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,180
things so I borrow heavily from them so

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:31,260
hello this is me we don't really care

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,090
that much so I'm going to give you some

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,579
backstory just because it's pertinent to

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,890
why I care about this in the first place

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,290
I'm largely self-taught I started

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,320
programming when I was six using basic

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,480
and a color computer three that we got

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,670
I was almost published in a magazine

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,309
called PCM which is what I learned basic

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,600
from because I made circles on a screen

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,399
and I think they just thought it was

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,210
neat that a kid had submitted something

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,969
for publishing but I kept going and in

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,280
high school as I was maybe halfway

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,600
through they were just starting to

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,400
figure out that hey maybe computers

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,409
belongs in the school and so we got our

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,700
first computer lab and we got the first

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,430
person willing to try to teach

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:16,619
programming and yeah I think it was

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:20,909
processed Cal and and I think I made a

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:23,189
ASCII chess game had one extra piece and

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,080
then a procedural planet surface

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,220
generator or something like that all of

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,439
which I forgotten how to do because I

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,070
wouldn't recognize Pascal now if I saw

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,020
it but I went off to University

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,400
University of Maine actually and I told

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,630
them I was interested in making games

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,509
and they had no idea what I was talking

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,310
about so they showed me to computer

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,259
science which started out okay but

00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:49,079
financial things got weird

00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:51,000
so I spent way too long there and really

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,740
didn't get out of it what I wanted but

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,049
in the middle of that I started working

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,149
professionally and the first place was

00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:01,670
that interactive marketing group in

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:03,930
Bangor Maine where I probably made 200

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,509
static websites it was all just design

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,280
work at the time but after that I went

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,819
on to a place called numbers USA which

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,430
is down in DC did not move

00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:17,840
originally but shortly after I started

00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,269
they wanted me once they figured out

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,189
that I could program they wanted me to

00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:25,519
learn this framework that they had made

00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:28,579
for them by a third party which was

00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,989
called TCG noosa as basically the name

00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:34,489
of their company plus the name of ours

00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:38,150
and that was all Perl I was Perl 5 8

00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:41,919
this was around 2002 and I think it

00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:44,870
still pretty much is Perl 5 8 today

00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,430
after a while 2007 they wanted they

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,959
didn't want really telecommuters anymore

00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,000
so they asked me to move to a sampling

00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,579
office in New York which well New York

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,379
upstate New York which I did for a

00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:55,849
couple of years but then that didn't

00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:57,889
really work out so they said well could

00:02:55,849 --> 00:03:00,980
you move to Virginia instead which I did

00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:03,230
but I kind of resented because Northern

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,389
Virginia / DC area is kind of a swamp in

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,930
the literal sense it's just the climate

00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:11,629
is horrible I can't stand it so kind of

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,099
wanting to you know take control of my

00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:14,750
future to certain extent I started

00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:17,930
networking which is not something I'm

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:21,379
good at but I found a local group called

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:24,470
DC p.m. and they sort of took me in and

00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:27,049
at first when I first started going we

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,569
might have 20 or 30 attendees which you

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:31,879
know was empowering I think we had

00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:39,229
people from ThinkGeek and other places

00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:40,819
like that but after a while fewer and

00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:43,549
people started showing up and I'm pretty

00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,049
sure I don't smell that bad so I think

00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:47,530
it had more something to do with the

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:50,000
community overall so we had just

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,609
conversations usually at the first

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,109
Tuesday of the month meetup like when

00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:58,310
was the last time so-and-so had come and

00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:01,250
then there was questions like how can we

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,109
get people to come back and pizza

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,569
usually increases the equation briefly

00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:07,519
you know they show up for one meetup

00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:10,310
maybe two but it really wasn't a

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,400
permanent solution

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:15,139
so still concerned about you know what

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,849
was going on I started contributing to

00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:20,120
the local workshop the d.c Baltimore

00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:23,330
Perl workshop and I am not 100% sure if

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,920
I was there for 2013 but I was for 14 15

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:30,000
and 16

00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:33,330
after which in 17 we did the TPC in well

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,640
Alexandria at the Patent Office and then

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,620
after that we took a break because that

00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,300
was quite a lot of work with her or some

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,050
surprises involved with what it took to

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:45,120
actually run a thing like that and one

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,070
of the things that we learned both well

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,410
actually I forgot to mention we came

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:55,530
back just this past April to startup DC

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:57,150
bbw again and at both of those those of

00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,820
us who organized had to submit our own

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,680
talks because we didn't get quite enough

00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,540
to fill out a whole schedule so one of

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,500
the things I'm asking for is that people

00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,060
submit more talks for next year now I'm

00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,170
gonna put a pin in this because of

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:15,300
something that's gonna bout to come up

00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:16,920
in a few minutes here not unrelated not

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,140
too long after I started at DS p.m. I

00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,420
also started attending this thing called

00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,000
Cove or Nova which was an extension of

00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,650
Code for America which is important

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,880
coming up but I'm gonna start

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,190
plagiarizing a whole bunch of people

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:34,710
right now this is Stephen a little he

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:36,060
gave the similar talk 2013 2014 that's

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,020
the tab will be indexed in the

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,630
background I hope I'm saying that

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,640
correctly he said things like pearl is

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,130
not dead but it is a dead end

00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,080
you had complaints about CGI which I'm

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,740
pretty sure at work one of our scripts

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,360
still uses he said can we have threads

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,160
this of course this like I said this is

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,990
dated this is a little bit old but it

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,480
was there during my formative years for

00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:01,890
this sort of thing POA is great back in

00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,270
1999 object-oriented hit 94 java ran

00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,070
with it it took us a while to get around

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,330
to it

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,560
subroutine signatures are quite recent

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,550
in the grand scheme of things but

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,080
Fortran COBOL and Lisp had them forever

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,980
sipan's great but it's no longer the

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,780
only game in town for that sort of thing

00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,340
but these are all pretty for me at least

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,410
low-level things I wasn't as concerned

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,850
about those it was the community stuff

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,010
that I really sort of latched on so he

00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:29,850
said the Perl was sort of an echo

00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:31,260
chamber and that's you know I resemble

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,600
that remark to a certain degree because

00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:37,200
I only he had to point out when he saw

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,370
that slide why not use a postfix

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,230
dereference

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,980
which I had no idea existed until yeah

00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:45,449
he said a few days ago so he said people

00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,240
once they leave the island they don't

00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,889
come back we're proud of our bike

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,510
shedding because backwards-compatibility

00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,910
I didn't even know what that meant I'd

00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,190
to go look it up

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,620
and he wasn't the only one we got I hope

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,900
I say it correct me when I say me revolt

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,530
but I'm gonna say me revolt he said that

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,820
pearls growth has stagnated or declined

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:08,430
sciences and bioinformatics are mostly

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:12,270
in Python I get to do the former

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:14,220
occasionally but I use are it's no

00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,320
longer just a rival we with rivalry with

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,860
Python we've got Ruby and PHP and node

00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,560
and others to contend with Perl mongers

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,240
are just being too busy being productive

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,330
to herald Perl and this is one of the

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,610
things that I really latched onto so put

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,500
a pin that he said no one's even

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,450
teaching this stuff and that's pretty

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,479
much true I went looking at the time

00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,850
Khan Academy didn't have it Udacity code

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,930
Academy didn't have it various schools

00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,310
that were just starting to flirt with

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,940
open-source and some of their coursework

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:47,010
didn't have any mention of Perl there's

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,780
one called lynda.com that I think at the

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,240
time had one and since then I found that

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,280
udemy has three one of them is pretty

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,680
long so it might be pretty good but I

00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:01,710
didn't actually look into it did you

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:04,380
mean petal so if you're looking to get

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,570
help with Perl there's plenty of

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,430
tutorials you can find there are re OCS

00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,979
there are these two you know groups like

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,270
DC PM but unless you already know that

00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,440
you're looking for Perl in the first

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,610
place you're not going to find them

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,190
because you don't you don't know that's

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:22,620
a thing so a person I'm working with at

00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:25,110
code for Nova actually just asked me one

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,910
day like people still use this and you

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,380
know as of today or maybe when I made

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,380
this slide one point something percent

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,880
literally Saturday as I was tinkering

00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,700
with the slides that was mentioned that

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,740
Python has reached a new high

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,270
technically though 8.5% is still not as

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,810
high as Perl was at its peak

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,880
but at the time Perl had fewer

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,360
adversaries I suppose so what's the

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,850
point of all this

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,430
/ was good to me at a time when I needed

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:57,070
it to be it has served me well

00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:00,850
throughout overly long career now I'm

00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:05,019
starting to think our curl our pearl

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:06,490
codebase is no longer alone at work but

00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,380
it is still the most stable piece of

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,560
work we've got and we may have upgraded

00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:15,130
to five ten but it's still really really

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:20,800
venerable and the local group took me in

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:23,950
and that was good but our attendance is

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,110
very low these days in fact in the last

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,940
couple of years probably since TPC it's

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:31,649
not a given that we're going to meet in

00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:35,980
any given month so if we meet at all I

00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:39,130
just covered that so I don't really care

00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,230
about indexes I just care that pearl is

00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,690
still a choice that people can and know

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,910
they can make if they have a project in

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:49,540
mind or a business to start or anything

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,190
like that so let's see and quite

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:56,500
honestly pearl is still quite good at

00:09:51,190 --> 00:10:02,740
what we needed to do so what then it's a

00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:05,279
segue this is Katherine Bracy okay she

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,959
has done quite a few things

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,690
she gave a TED talk or one of these like

00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:13,029
TEDx side talks they do at TEDx City -

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,520
oh why hackers make good citizens this

00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,230
is sort of where I get into maybe

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,930
there's something we can do about this

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,930
she said every day cities are being

00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,310
asked to do more with less and

00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,800
separately by stitching together each

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,720
small act of participation we can we

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,100
think we can reenter joy citizenship and

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,990
restore trust in government so when

00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:36,250
she's talking about civic hacking she

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,660
means fixing local problems so I'm

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,550
pretty sure that is a Volcom proverb

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:43,390
menhir something like the needs of the

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,760
many so as I was literally designing the

00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:48,339
first version of this talk something

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,040
more than a lightning talk she was

00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:53,290
speaking in front of pike on 2015 giving

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,930
this not this talk but something on this

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,699
nature and the people attending seem to

00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,050
like that quite a bit it was really

00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,490
quite accidental ways just sort of

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,660
glanced at Twitter and realized wait a

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,180
minute this is out

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:07,189
so she said hacking has equal power for

00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,829
good as it has for evil and it isn't

00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:12,230
necessarily done on a computer hacking

00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:13,490
is really just any amateur innovation on

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,649
an existing system

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,480
she gives various examples throughout

00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,220
her talk she says Betsy Ross is a hacker

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,410
the Underground Railroad is a hack

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,269
the Wright brothers are hackers in their

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:27,230
way but her favorite was Benjamin

00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:29,779
Franklin who invented bifocals lightning

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,600
rod he created the first volunteer fire

00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,279
brigade for Philadelphia and American

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:39,019
democracy itself could be considered

00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:41,089
kind of a hack and despite that he never

00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:44,060
filed a single patent and out of his

00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:45,800
autobiography he wrote Governor Thomas

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,689
was so pleased with the construction of

00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,879
this stove that he offered to give me a

00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:52,519
patent for the sole vending of it for a

00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:54,709
term of years but I declined it from a

00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,560
principle which has ever waited with me

00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:59,209
on such occasions that as we enjoy great

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,100
advantages advantages from the

00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:03,500
inventions of others we should be glad

00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,899
of an opportunity to serve others by any

00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:11,300
invention of ours and freely and

00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:14,990
generously so I have examples the city

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:18,529
of Honolulu had a site trying to help

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,850
visitors and and and citizens get their

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,620
way around town know what there was to

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,269
do things like that no one that no one

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,000
it was so terrible people didn't use it

00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:27,980
so they asked three volunteers to revamp

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,319
the whole thing and they are like yeah I

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,509
don't think so

00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:34,490
so what they did was they just made

00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:35,959
fairly simple this very little

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,519
programming involved something they

00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:39,889
called Honolulu answers so it's just

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,829
just more approachable and they

00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:44,839
crowdsource the effort in a single

00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:46,970
Saturday afternoon with a whole bunch of

00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,160
volunteers and they just got questions

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,480
and they wrote answers and they put it

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,980
on the website and it was that was all

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,750
there is to it but this was such a huge

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,399
success that Oakland immediately asked

00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,319
for the same treatment and that has

00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,500
worked for them as well

00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:02,089
Mexico City some years ago wanted to

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,069
spend or had gotten into a contract to

00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:06,410
spend their equivalent of 9.8 million

00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:10,819
dollars for an app to help them track

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:13,309
legislation but the local geese knew

00:13:10,819 --> 00:13:14,930
that that was absurd they could do so

00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:16,519
much better for so much less

00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,970
so they issued a challenge that had to

00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,100
be completed in ten days there was a

00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,860
reward involved I think for winners of

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,350
9800 so about one ten thousandth of the

00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,910
fee they got one hundred and seventy

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,769
three submissions five of which were

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,019
considered winners and went on in and

00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:36,230
are still being used by the legislators

00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:37,459
in Mexico City and that really sort of

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,139
inspired a whole bunch of people to try

00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:41,899
the same thing for other problems that

00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:43,279
needed solving this is one I'm

00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:46,189
personally familiar with the National

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,339
Science Foundation trying to remember

00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:51,290
one this is a few years back there was a

00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:54,350
time where budget cuts were being sought

00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,509
and they taken a lot of tax money and

00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,100
they give it away again and in some

00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:59,720
cases it didn't look like that money did

00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,569
much so they were a prime target for

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,730
cuts which they didn't want to be and it

00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:06,619
turns out there was good reason

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:10,100
so we at Code for Nova we took a look at

00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:12,529
this and by hand we just looked at one

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,420
year so by 2012 they gave out money

00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:17,839
usually a few million here a few million

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:20,769
there mostly to universities and then

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,540
what sometimes or often happens is

00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:24,860
somebody from that research invents

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,870
something and they think wait there's a

00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,879
business here and they patent it and if

00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,319
that happens they just want to know was

00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,350
our money well-spent and there's a form

00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:34,939
you fill out but it turns out compliance

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,370
for that was very low even when they

00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:38,929
tried to comply like they put the ID

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,720
number of the grant in the wrong field

00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:43,490
or in the wrong format now this is just

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,249
a simple regex problem which it turned

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:48,170
out to be but they wrote these pattern

00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:51,649
matching things and what they found was

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:54,019
that the number of patents that came

00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:55,490
from their grants issued in 2012 were

00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:57,079
eight times what they thought they were

00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,970
so when you're trying to go to the

00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:03,290
government and say our money is useful

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:04,490
that that really really helped so aside

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:09,110
from those of us who knew more about

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:11,809
what was going on thank you mostly that

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,829
was done by students so any of that

00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:15,679
could have been done in Perl I don't

00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:17,329
think any of it was so what I'm saying

00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,040
is there are a lot of things out there

00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:20,809
that need fixing there are a lot of

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,759
people right here who know how to fix

00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:26,749
things and Perl is a pretty good tool

00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:28,499
for doing that so what if the Perl

00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:30,659
community went out and found real

00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:34,049
problems solve them with pearl and gave

00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:35,999
away the results what if the gift needed

00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:38,249
just a little bit of support that could

00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:40,859
be satisfied by some local youth on as a

00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:43,799
summer job what if that little hack

00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:45,389
spread to the towns nearby and what if

00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:46,829
there was enough of them using it that

00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:48,329
they needed support and you needed to

00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:51,809
start a business to support this thing

00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:54,049
you made what if you hired people into

00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:56,459
this business and trained them in Perl

00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:58,889
it may be a few more people start

00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:00,869
showing up what if this new blood

00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:03,269
started showing up to this conference or

00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:05,249
to our local one what if they just

00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:07,379
showed up to DC p.m. again and we were

00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:08,819
actually meeting every month or I don't

00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:13,889
know what it's like here but I assume it

00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:16,409
might be similar what if you made an app

00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:19,549
that just helped locals report problems

00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:22,079
with their local roads or an app that

00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:23,759
easiest to install to cut the helped

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,479
Townsville organize their own social

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,529
hacks without having to know programming

00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:31,379
what if you made a module bent on

00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:34,279
teaching programming and use Perl to do

00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:37,589
it what if that meant Perl was taught

00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:40,739
alongside Python or instead of Python to

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:42,509
middle scores and high scores what if

00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:44,189
after all that you released a free and

00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:46,769
easy to install application application

00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:48,149
that turned education on its head such

00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:49,979
that teachers were paid more but

00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:53,549
students could also master any and every

00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:56,429
subject H wanted what if you fixed

00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:58,439
online voting or helped people

00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:59,149
understand how to have their carbon

00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:01,799
footprint

00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:05,819
what if Perl became synonymous with

00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:08,189
civic hacking or improving the world Pro

00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:11,189
five and six can do this so we just need

00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:13,470
people to know that what I've observed

00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:15,419
from both groups is that people show up

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,350
when there's something to do I mean a

00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,879
lot of them come because they think

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:20,159
they're going to learn this and get a

00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:21,539
job but also the thing that keeps them

00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:24,029
coming back is there's actually

00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:26,369
something happening there's a project so

00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:30,299
what we need is to give Perl I think a

00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:34,110
project or ten on that note I have a

00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:35,509
project it's called ingredient guru sort

00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,970
of bent on improving public health

00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:40,750
through healthy eating having leverage

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,060
folks competitive spirit I'm being

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,970
Vegh you're on purpose while saving the

00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:48,520
money and part of the impetus behind

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,870
this is the AMA some years ago estimated

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,580
three-quarters of our medical spending

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:55,060
was based on the side effects of poor

00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:58,660
nutrition so right now we're doing it in

00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:00,580
Perl 6 we using Crowe I'm leading the

00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,350
project I'm not doing though much though

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,730
but again high school students are

00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,500
working on this so they're actively

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:09,130
learning Perl now where they wouldn't

00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,590
have port and their teacher who had been

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,110
relying on Python up until now really

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,190
seems to like this language he's only

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:18,850
been looking at it for a few weeks

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:20,620
though but and one of the reasons he

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,320
said I think I do I have a sign for this

00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:27,400
will present this hopefully something at

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,110
the D CPW maybe TPC next year but his

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,280
reason for choosing Python to teach was

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,050
that it was already highly opinionated

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,710
that he didn't want the students to

00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:36,940
worry about the flexibility of something

00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,640
like Perl he wanted them to understand

00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,940
the concepts first and I struck me that

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,460
if we made a module that sort of induced

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,370
some opinionated Mis on Perl as a

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,690
teaching tool kit they can get started

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,970
that way and then you sort of dial it

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,910
back so they get more of the flexibility

00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,470
that pipe Perl offers so that's pretty

00:18:54,910 --> 00:19:01,620
much it

00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:01,620
there's any questions okay okay

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:37,919
gov zero okay yep well it's just at work

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,070
I mean I'm

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,630
sadly sort of overseeing the extrication

00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,520
of our probe framework we're replacing

00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:47,909
it and I wouldn't be doing that

00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,500
voluntarily but I'm a little frustrated

00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:50,789
with how long it's taking my staff to

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,200
get new things done

00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,960
whereas I could just turn to Perot and

00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,880
get it done just like that and I feel

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,830
like something that works that well

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,600
should be made available to people who

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,130
want to do little projects like this or

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,960
things that won't even necessarily stay

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,960
little it wasn't another question

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,520
ingredient guru you won't be able to

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:14,460
find I don't think anywhere outside of

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,260
github yet because it's very young I

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,090
mean like I said high school students

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,380
are starting to poke at this so they've

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,900
got a lot to get their heads around at

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:26,809
this point but we hope to present

00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,809
something next year anything else

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:39,200
[Applause]

00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,200
