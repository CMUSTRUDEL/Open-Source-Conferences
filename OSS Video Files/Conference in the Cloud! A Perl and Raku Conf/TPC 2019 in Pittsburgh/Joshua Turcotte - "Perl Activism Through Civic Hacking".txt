Description: 
	Ultimately, this is very meta to perl; but the idea here is to encourage volunteering time and talent and perl's raw capacity for getting interesting things done, done quickly, and done well toward fixing local socio-economic problems. If the local government isn't up to the task, why shouldn't we do it? Benjamin Franklin did a bit of civic hacking when we got the first volunteer fire department going in Philly, or created and gave away, patent-free, many inventions. Civic hackers here in Arlington and Alexandria helped both the National Science Foundation and the Patent and Trademark Office find 800% more connections between grants and patents for 2012 than they'd been able to do on their own. Civic hackers saved Mexico City the equivalent of several millions of dollars by creating open source applications. Franklin didn't have perl, admittedly, and we used python for the NSF and I suspect perl was not much at place in Mexico City. But it could have been, and should have been... and, honestly, there's so much left to do, from building a pothole tracking application to holding congress's feet to the fire on critical issues like climate change or internal socio-economic policies, and all through data and applications and networking the likes of which perl would be wizardly at. So let's talk about it.
