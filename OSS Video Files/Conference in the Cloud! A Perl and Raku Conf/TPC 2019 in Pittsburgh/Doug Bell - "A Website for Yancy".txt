Publication date: 2019-06-18
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	This talk is about how I created a documentation website for my Yancy CMS project. This talk includes:
How to create a basic, Markdown-based website with Mojolicious and Yancy
How to render Perl module documentation (POD) in a Mojolicious website
How to export a dynamic Mojolicious website to a set of static files using Mojolicious::Command::export
Other tips and tricks for building content-based websites with Mojolicious
No previous experience with Mojolicious is necessary to understand this talk, but some basic familiarity with Perl syntax is recommended.
