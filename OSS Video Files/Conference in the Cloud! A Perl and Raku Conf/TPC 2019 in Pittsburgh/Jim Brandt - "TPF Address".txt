	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,390
good morning everyone how's everybody

00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:08,010
doing all right there is a time when you

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,660
could not get even that kind of energy

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,460
out of a pearl crab this early in the

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,110
morning so I think we're all a little

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,320
bit older now morning is not quite as

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,640
scary as it used to be so probably many

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,770
fewer people who just stayed up all

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,020
night - that used to happen for some

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,750
people so welcome to the pearl

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,609
conference again yeah here in beautiful

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,680
Pittsburgh once again for the fourth

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,439
time as was mentioned earlier I'm Jim

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,730
Brandt president of the pearl foundation

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,489
so we're the charitable organization

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:38,250
that accepts donations to support things

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:42,510
for Pearl like these conferences so

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,770
that's our involvement with this Dan did

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,379
this but you really can't thank people

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,239
enough given that everyone who puts all

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,250
this stuff together our volunteers so I

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,559
want to say thank you again to the list

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,390
that Dan had in - Dan right no one ever

00:00:52,559 --> 00:01:00,660
thanks Dan so thank you Dan for all the

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:03,539
work and all the lists that Dan had up

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,700
here before as he said those folks work

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,320
almost all year round there's a slack

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,810
group that they're on they do meetings

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,790
over Xoom we have great tools now to be

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,110
able to do distributed meetings and

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,939
planning and things like that but they

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,500
really do they work almost it starts

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,390
almost after the conference is over the

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,340
the planning for next year so a lot of

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,259
work goes into this so so thank you to

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,280
them and also the speakers all of the

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,930
talks you're gonna go to in the next

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,520
couple of days keep in mind that your

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,439
speakers have put in hours and hours of

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,329
time getting their slides ready possibly

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,610
right up to the actual given of the

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,490
presentation accent maybe sometimes

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,420
during and all the code and all the

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,250
stuff that they're gonna talk about they

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,720
put a lot of time and so thanks to all

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,380
the speakers who basically provide all

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,299
the content for our presentations and as

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,159
Dan said thank you to all of our

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,439
sponsors we really can't do any of this

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,030
stuff without our sponsors they

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,159
subsidize all this stuff so that we can

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,659
keep the costs low for people to come

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,820
you may notice that compared to other

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,640
conferences the cost to come to a pro

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,540
conference is very low and many all of

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,340
the other initiatives everything I'm

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,580
gonna talk about really is supported by

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,320
all of these companies and

00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:16,760
sponsorship so thank you again to all

00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:18,290
the companies please alright so I go to

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,370
other conferences not just pro

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,600
conferences and one of the ones that

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,820
I've gone to for the last couple of

00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,680
years is an organization called EDUCAUSE

00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,080
and they do IT for some of you who might

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,160
be in education like universities and

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,680
things like that

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,720
they do different talks around education

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,740
and they do security stuff so I've gone

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,850
to the security conference one of the

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,710
fun things that they do is they have a

00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,630
theme for every year so for all the

00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,940
speakers they ask them to kind of try to

00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,800
participate in the theme two years ago

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,300
they were in Baltimore which is right on

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,340
the water so of course they did like a

00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,500
nautical theme so if you can imagine a

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,510
couple of days of Talk Like a Pirate Day

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,670
that's pretty much what that was all

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,990
about so but it was fun everybody kind

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,880
of included that in their talk

00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,900
descriptions and they tried to all have

00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,020
you know sort of that kind of stuff

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,700
going on this year they were in Chicago

00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,990
so they went with the Windy City theme

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,209
right so the weather and things like

00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:07,070
that and one of the talks I was looking

00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:08,870
through the schedule was tornado talks

00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,610
and I thought tornado talks what's that

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,260
about right so I show up and of course

00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,760
they start describing things and they're

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,350
trying to go with the theme but what

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,209
they're really talking about was

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,950
lightning talks right

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,630
and almost every conference I go to

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,250
honestly today and I don't know if this

00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,959
is everyone else's experience but this

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,489
idea of lightning talks it's such a

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,860
great idea it's just become just

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,690
accepted these are just everywhere and

00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,519
it actually started and you think about

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,160
the legacy of pearl it's not just the

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,820
language it's the community this the

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,220
term was coined at the second Yap sea by

00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,320
Mark Jason Dominus so you think about

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,739
the ways that pearl has influenced the

00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,310
IT world open source all the things that

00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,260
we do

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,519
I was actually as I went to the tornado

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,080
talks I was think about this I actually

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,459
looked it up you can look up the

00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,530
Wikipedia page and like there's our

00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,810
history just like it's scattered all

00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,190
over the place it's not even just in

00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,600
people talking about pearl in the

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,670
language and things like that but things

00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,380
like how we do conferences and the

00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,650
really good ideas rise to the top so I

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,330
thought that was kind of cool that the

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:12,440
Pearl still has a connection to all of

00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:15,080
these different things so as Dan said 20

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,530
years absolutely amazing still doing

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,310
conferences after 20 years and of course

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:23,580
that means next year the

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,680
conference will be 21 so it can drink I

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,150
have not talked to Dan about what that's

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,120
going to do to our insurance for next

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:33,540
year but we'll deal with that as we as

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,370
we move forward so before we talk about

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,080
all the awesome stuff about today which

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,120
is what all the talks would be about I'd

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,370
like to take a little trip into what was

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,210
the world like 20 years ago when all

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,250
this started at the first Yap see so

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,050
let's start off baseline what was pearl

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,460
like the pearls that people were running

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,810
as far as I can gather at the time we're

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,310
504 which had been released a couple

00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,530
years earlier so I think was pretty

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,060
widely available I think most folks had

00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,260
stopped with pearl for although I'm sure

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,889
was still out there and sure many people

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,870
were still using it and then 505 had

00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:08,340
just recently been released and when you

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,680
go back and look at the features that

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,120
were added in these early releases we

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,350
don't think about it now so many things

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,080
we just take for granted but it was

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,820
things like all the modules support so

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,590
we could have you know sure did shared

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:25,200
modules so that build things like Sipan

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:26,789
I think in 504 CGI p.m. was added and

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,350
you know sort of spurring like all the

00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:30,720
internet stuff it was gonna happen after

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,240
that and believe it or not Perl 6 would

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,100
be announced just the next year in 2000

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,330
so that's when they would actually start

00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,700
thinking about that it was a while

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,180
several years of gathering documents and

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,789
things like that

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,210
but almost 20 years ago that was already

00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:49,440
being talked about this is what Amazon

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:53,070
looked like 20 years ago so Amazon it

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,080
was five years old in 99 still mostly

00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,090
thought of as a bookseller at that time

00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,530
I don't think anybody I don't care who

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,440
you are would have guessed at that time

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,150
that some huge huge portion of the IT

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,160
infrastructure would be hosted on

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,560
something called AWS that would also be

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,360
Amazon and arguably you know almost

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,660
their bigger influence at least probably

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,990
for most the stuff that people work on

00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:19,110
in this room prime would not come until

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,530
2005 so we still had some time until

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,000
that concept which everyone knows about

00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,949
supposedly a pearl shop yeah yep

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,539
everybody was a pearl shop back then

00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:33,360
right so so that was Amazon you might

00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:37,110
recognize these so this is what Apple

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,139
was doing in 1999 I still have one of

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,930
these it still runs which is pretty cool

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,810
and at that time if you wanted to run

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,150
pro they were Mac's for running OS 9 at

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:51,150
the time so you had Mac pearl and Kris

00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,110
nan doors here the Mac pearl guy so he

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,729
was one of people involved in that

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,240
project that made that possible so that

00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:59,849
people could run Perl on their Mac's the

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,259
OS 10 Mac OS 10 which is what everybody

00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:02,789
knows today which gave you Unix

00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,740
underneath right so then everybody had

00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,990
Perl that wouldn't be released until

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,610
2000 so you had some time to wait so Mac

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,849
Perl was basically the way you're gonna

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:15,900
go the iPhone would not come out until

00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:17,370
June of 2007 so it's almost unimaginable

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,340
now that that just didn't exist

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,750
it just wasn't around until 2007 and

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,539
everybody I think at least I remember

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,030
all the job postings going up for app

00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:28,800
development in you know 2008 saying 5

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,550
years of experience required for iPhone

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,870
development

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,340
all right everybody remembers those and

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,000
you could call HR and be like that's not

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,949
possible

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,389
what do you mean we always require five

00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:41,099
years you know so the ipods were 2001 so

00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:42,840
not too far off from 99

00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:47,250
so the ipods would be would be coming

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,770
out this is what google looked like so

00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:52,110
the actual search was still in beta at

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,099
that time way more links on the home

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,120
page

00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:58,319
they had like some kind of mailing list

00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,759
or something going on of course this is

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,960
before they just had everyone's email

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,120
right so they had to actually ask for it

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,890
now they don't need to ask anymore so

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,480
all those links at the bottom they don't

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,030
they don't need any more but it was

00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,560
barely one year old in 99 so they're

00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,890
really still just getting started again

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,930
amazing to think about the amount of

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:22,480
scope of what Google does today compared

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:25,880
to what was going on then also in 99

00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,190
Aarti request tracker had the first

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,920
official 1.0 release this is what it

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:33,380
looked like back then so RT is also 20

00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,150
years old I work at best practical so I

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,979
was curious about this but yeah also the

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,450
20th anniversary of the official first

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,840
release there were releases before this

00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,940
but this was the first official one I

00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,570
have in my professional capacity at best

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,550
practical I did visit a client within

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,640
the past two years who was still running

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,680
RT one on a server so believe it or not

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,180
and it was and they was still fine I

00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,350
basically went there to do a train

00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,150
they're like well we added a few

00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,190
features so if you've added those

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,050
features to RT since then we might

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:06,890
upgrade okay so they were literally

00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:08,060
running twenty-year-old software so so

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,340
everyone who's getting into this

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:14,000
internet thing and some of you might

00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,860
remember this website the there were

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,750
like a top five scripts how many people

00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,150
remember Matt's script archive at least

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,660
heard of it right yeah so yeah for good

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:25,910
and for bad right so some of the scripts

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,550
though from this site were some of the

00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:30,890
most widely run code literally on the

00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,870
entire of the early internet into the

00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,000
early 2000s this stuff people were

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,530
grabbing it and running it and it was

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,850
Pirozhki it was the top five scripts for

00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,310
Perl scripts where people were grabbing

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:43,250
it was email scripts to send email so

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,360
the early days of spam sadly and then of

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,090
course scripts when people were trying

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,950
to come up with dynamic websites so

00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,390
again this is one of the first ways that

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,160
a lot of people got exposed to Perl

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,410
again for good and bad there was a lot

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,500
of bad examples there people came along

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,450
in the subsequent years though and

00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,190
provided all sorts of better examples so

00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,780
different groups got together the early

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,560
versions of London p.m. and and other

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,060
groups got together and basically

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,440
rewrote all the scripts here and said no

00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,380
no here's here's how to do it so they

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,870
did sort of follow up but this was it a

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,890
lot of people got Excel

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,870
- pearl right here so pro-people then

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,550
also we're starting to get together and

00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,430
this is actually what the early versions

00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:24,790
of the bell pearl conference were so pro

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:27,490
conference 3 was getting planned in in

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,140
99 so they'd had to before this was the

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,029
first year that they were started

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,250
thinking about it being asked on so they

00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:35,230
linux was gonna be included and a bunch

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,339
of the other open source languages so it

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,560
went from being the first to pearl

00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:40,300
conferences to pro conference 3 plus I

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,770
think it was like Linux con Wan they

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,180
kind of did it as like sub conferences

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,010
I'm looking for people who I know are

00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,720
there to nod or be like you know know if

00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:48,940
you're making this up so so far I

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,440
haven't made anything up anything so you

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,940
can see the list is pretty interesting

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,450
it's very close to the list of speakers

00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,339
who were also presenting at another

00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,710
conference that also got going around

00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:02,080
that time which was the first Yap City

00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:04,000
so this is the the 20-year ago yep see

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,150
this website is still available by the

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,040
way so one of the big benefits of the

00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:11,020
old-school HTML is those files just need

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,810
to sit somewhere it's really easy to

00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,580
keep these websites around so this is

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,410
what it looked like as Dan said right

00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,900
here in Pittsburgh for the first two

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:22,300
years and of course the the yet another

00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,430
came from obviously pearl people love to

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,680
pun and there were a bunch of other sort

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,330
of things around at the time there's the

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,920
yet another pearl or just another pearl

00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,839
hacker the lines that people would

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,870
include there was the yet another

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,150
compiler compiler so this idea of yet

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,890
another was was kind of a funny thing

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,810
for them to do for the Pearl conference

00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,910
and it also turned into this is a

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:44,650
question we get all the time the other

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,200
name for the Pearl Foundation yet

00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,520
another Society which is unfortunate at

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,290
times when people are looking for us and

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,760
they typed in pearl foundation and it's

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,959
not there but that's where the name

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,480
comes from and that's why one of the

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,850
official first when pearl foundation

00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,050
became a thing it was it was yet another

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,459
Society which it kind of sounds kind of

00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,540
clandestine actually when you think

00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:04,770
about it almost sounds like we were

00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,000
doing something kind of sneaky but

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:10,330
anyway and maybe we were right in the

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,890
cell I can't talk about that or I will

00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,570
be I'll be kicked out you'll never hear

00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,610
from me again

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:17,850
so again yeah the the websites are still

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,100
there and I've got some other links so

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,660
grace of archive.org fantastic site you

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,920
should donate to them a lot of this

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,430
stuff that's the only place that it's

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,950
preserved

00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,570
of those previous screenshots but this

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,270
website is still live you can actually

00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:33,010
just go to it and check it out one of

00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,630
the interesting things actually on the

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,270
site - if you go there the site that's

00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:40,000
still there is early actually kept a

00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,810
diary for the conference which is kind

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,850
of interesting so I guess it was like

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,020
kind of pre blog where everyone would

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,460
have their blogs everywhere so they just

00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,810
linked it right off of the site and the

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,140
nice thing being that it's it's still

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,990
there

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,520
it's findable which which is kind of

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,200
cool

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,060
so because it's fine - both the the

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,560
schedule is still there so it's able to

00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,140
go through and look at some of the talks

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,490
so I will do the the David Letterman

00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,900
style for people who know who David

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,760
Letterman is I guess we're getting to a

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,460
time when you have to explain these

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,200
things but top top five talk titles

00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,490
again I don't know what the content what

00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,340
of what all these were I wasn't at the

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,950
very first one pearl economics the

00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,570
dismal arts this is way before economics

00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,670
was cool for economics and all that kind

00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,560
of stuff so again someone was thinking

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:24,130
ahead saw the economics would be a cool

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,490
thing in effective programming or

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,870
idiotic Perl so we talked about the code

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,610
of conduct things were a little looser

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,620
back then so people called people idiots

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,240
and things like that and then presumably

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,310
made slides of their Perl code and then

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,700
called them idiots in public so maybe

00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,450
Matz

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,210
Script archivist was included in there

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:45,490
so rebuilding a post-apocalyptic

00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:47,080
civilization with Perl so this one's

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,760
kind of I mean it's you know there's

00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,230
been in Apocalypse which is a little bit

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,230
negative but we're rebuilding right so

00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:55,600
that's a positive so kind of you know

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:58,930
back and forth the future begins

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,060
tomorrow that's kind of exciting so I

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,710
don't know I'm kind of curious that did

00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,270
it happen you know I guess you know we

00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,100
now know how it's going to turn out but

00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,810
I don't know if it went along with

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,910
whatever it was in the presentation and

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,710
then finally repent ye sinners

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,710
avoid sin tax hell yes people were

00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:16,420
pushing XML even in 99 they're still

00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:19,570
pushing it they still really want us to

00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:21,130
use XML but yeah the the JSON folks

00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,980
hadn't come along yet to say no no

00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:27,220
that's less markup less markup so and

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:29,620
then for the bonus talk that I actually

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,810
would love to actually see today

00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,860
reducing business risk using Perl I

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,120
would love to see that talk today so

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:39,010
that's still I think if

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:40,420
fantastic thing to talk about so as we

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:43,540
know looking back because we were here

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,710
20 years later things continued so the

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,220
first two years we're in Pittsburgh and

00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,480
then the third year actually moved not

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,690
only to a different city but a different

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:55,900
country so we were at McGill University

00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,610
in Canada in Montreal which is very cool

00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:00,130
this is the first Yap see I went to how

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,550
many people were at Montreal a few

00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:06,880
people so yeah you missed that Larry

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:08,740
missed that one so yeah really a great

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,860
conference you'll start to see a theme

00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,660
with that logo in just a minute and I

00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,130
remember again first one that I went to

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,100
and the first one where I kind of caught

00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:20,010
the bug of not only Perl in the language

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:23,200
but the community and being involved

00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:25,540
when I just saw everything the talks the

00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:29,529
people was just fantastic this is also

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:31,330
my first damien exposure which for all

00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:33,339
of you have had the pleasure was just

00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,570
absolutely mind-blowing I think this is

00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:36,580
the first one so there's a handful of

00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:39,430
people who were there I think he did

00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,930
Conway's Game of Life talk which was

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,750
just absolutely amazing and all this

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,250
live code running during you know during

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,730
his presentation which is always a scary

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,750
thing and just like my mind was blown I

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,380
think it was weeks before I thought

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:55,480
straight again after this one so as I

00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,760
mentioned I kind of caught the bug there

00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,350
the gestation period apparently for the

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,480
get involved with the Perl community bug

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:04,870
is about three years because in 2004 I

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,600
ran a yep see so that's about when when

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,430
things set in so that was in Buffalo

00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,170
which again as you can see we did not

00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,910
have graphics help back then because the

00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,320
logo is pretty much the same I can't

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,330
even tell what the difference between

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,010
the sites are but yeah so that was a

00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,110
buffalo

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,670
they've been posting photos we don't

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,529
follow they there's a Twitter account

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,970
that they do for the conference and they

00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:27,160
do all sorts of interesting stuff and

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,500
they did a post like about Buffalo and

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,779
share your memories and Anne Ricardo our

00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,720
GPS shared something that I've actually

00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:38,380
forgotten I was very sleep-deprived that

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,170
week did not sleep at all we did an off

00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,089
site off conference event we got tickets

00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,040
for everybody to go to an IMAX

00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,880
presentation of one of the Harry Potter

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,430
movies I think it was

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,930
prisoner of azkaban we reserved the

00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,790
whole theatre because I knew this crowd

00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,500
and I'm like we can't just all just go

00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,030
because everyone's gonna heckle and

00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,950
things like that so we got there is I

00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,450
think it was a midnight showing so

00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,790
everybody again we were much more

00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:03,370
tolerant of not sleeping back then so

00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,720
everyone went off you know to this IMAX

00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,819
theatre way away from the conference

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,620
midnight showing we had the whole

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:09,910
theater reserved but there were two

00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,319
people who showed there's a couple that

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,640
showed up and they insisted on being

00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,810
allowed to see the movie like they

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,130
really wanted to see what that showing I

00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,900
mean we tried to explain to them you're

00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,990
not gonna enjoy this like they're not

00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,610
gonna just let you it's not gonna go the

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,319
way you think and they insisted insisted

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:26,470
so they got in and I think they might

00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,840
have made it about 20 minutes in before

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,920
they left and and I think they gave him

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,240
their money because they were like we

00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,670
told you but they did get their money

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,160
back so anyway that was the one of the

00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:40,060
fun things that we got from from Buffalo

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,790
so more searching and I found my post on

00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:45,100
slash dot also still live weird call for

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:48,340
participation and the reason I throw

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,930
this one up is slash dot also for all of

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,180
you who remember slash dot one of the

00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:56,230
biggest news sites for many many years

00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:58,270
also written in Perl slash code was the

00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,970
engine that drove this and that was all

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:03,760
Perl code so I'll still up there and

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:07,600
running we had our own sort of Perl

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,100
slash type site used Perl org and Chris

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,560
and I were talking this morning we're

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,440
trying to remember and we think it was

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:17,260
around 2000 that used up coral org went

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:20,020
up as the the Perl version so I think

00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:22,630
Chris used that as a test bed for new

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:24,970
features as a kind of a lower volume

00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,320
version of the slash code because I

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,810
think once I went up I'm the actual it's

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,220
going to get it got pounded for people

00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:32,190
who don't remember there was a slide

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,530
just so you get an idea of the volume of

00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:37,900
requests that Slashdot used to use to

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,310
routinely see every day there was a

00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,560
thing called slash dating back then if

00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:43,300
everybody remembers so a story would go

00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:46,270
live on slash dot and immediately

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,860
crashed the site that it linked to and

00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,560
this was not just like one time this

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,660
happened this was a frequent thing and

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,280
and I think actually I don't know if if

00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,390
Chris can can nod back there if they

00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,390
started they actually give people a

00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,770
little warning

00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,480
for they would post stuff just so that

00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,300
because it would happen so many times so

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:06,140
the slashed out of fact exactly yes yes

00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:09,320
so there yes so Larry site was taken

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:11,810
down by the slash that effect so again

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,880
the the legacy of Perl that the site was

00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:16,100
written Perl we had her own and again if

00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:20,720
one of the highest volume websites at

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:23,120
the time it was up there running so the

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,290
special offer we apologized that we

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,310
didn't think of this earlier but I just

00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,110
thought it as I was putting my slides

00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:30,020
together and I've talked to a few people

00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:32,660
we had a slot in the schedule for

00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,400
tomorrow I think it 154 people kind of

00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,570
do to your Yap see memories and things

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,820
like that but we thought was put a

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,200
different spin on it of the people here

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,000
there's many people here who are at the

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,300
first Yap see and then also just at the

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,470
first five so if people remember we can

00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,120
get in and again this the sites you're

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,440
live you can go look at the topics of

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,850
your talks if people want to give a

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,240
five-minute like a lightning talk

00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:55,610
version of the talk you gave back at one

00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,830
of those we have a slot at 150 on

00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:00,200
Tuesday if you can pull slides or

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,400
whatever you had that would be fantastic

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,330
I would love to see materials from there

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,620
I don't know if people can do that

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,090
either I'm sure notice or if they even

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,360
exist anymore

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,830
but Tuesday at Oh at 140 so we have a

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,480
slot in the schedule for that so if

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,560
anybody who is presented at those

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,840
conferences can go find

00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,400
even just from maybe from you talk title

00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,410
you can remember what it was that you

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,690
did we'd like to do lightening versions

00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,690
of that I think that would be fun yes

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,200
how would they express interest I don't

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,100
know maybe Jeff could help me he's good

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,930
at putting this stuff together there you

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,790
go perfect thank you so Jeff said use

00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:37,280
the use the lightning talk submission

00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,960
form so this is like retro lightning

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,220
talk kind of so the app will we'll call

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,350
it a modified thing but it's got to be a

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,350
talk that you gave back then so

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,420
there we go yeah in the comments section

00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:54,980
say that yeah you're doing the the retro

00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:58,340
so alright let's jump ahead fast-forward

00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:16,670
20 years now that we've got oh there we

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:18,800
go there you go nice nice so huh yeah

00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,880
right is there is there a missing was

00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:29,990
there one missing or no you got them all

00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:32,000
there's several missing so were you you

00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,050
Montreal so you're a good person did

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,740
they have a t-shirt that year

00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:38,600
do you remember I can't find mine oh I

00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,710
see I don't think they did I don't know

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,080
okay

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,790
fast forward 20 years so where where are

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,900
we at now with pearl obviously that's

00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,540
we're going to talk about all of the

00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,820
current stuff is this conference but

00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:54,820
just from from a high level from a pearl

00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:57,110
level this is the releases the steady a

00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,040
constant set of new releases that have

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,410
come out I think this is absolutely

00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,750
fantastic and amazing I think there are

00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,520
a few commercial products that have had

00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,320
this kind of regularity because this is

00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,050
just the regular releases of pearl over

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,390
the last ten to ten to fifteen years

00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:14,600
it's just a steady predictable schedule

00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:17,660
of releases with any fixes for security

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,060
things updates new features Unicode

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:22,850
support just it's still one of the most

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,830
stable and and well maintained languages

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,380
that are out there so I just think that

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:30,800
this is a fantastic legacy after all

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:33,500
this time I'd love to show the Sipan

00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,910
mirrors that if you look at a lot of the

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,170
other popular systems was the open

00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,180
source languages have something like

00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,830
Sipan where they share things but there

00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:43,520
was an issue a couple of years ago with

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:45,050
NPM super popular repository where most

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,030
people I think all people there was this

00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,860
one central repository and that went

00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:51,230
down and people were like we can't build

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,430
our website and things like that so some

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,680
of the things that pearl folks have

00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:57,290
learned over the years you know that you

00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,860
shouldn't have just one of something one

00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,850
thing though

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,250
we thought was interesting when I was

00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,649
looking at this what's going on in

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,700
Iceland why don't we have one there does

00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:06,320
anybody there's got to be some

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,590
universities or something in Iceland

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,029
right

00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:14,090
does anybody have any contacts in

00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:18,409
Iceland can we get a Sipan mirror yeah

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,789
okay right yeah that's true that's true

00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:23,830
but they have computers right

00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:23,830
they must have computers now so

00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:28,730
I don't think hosting a Sipan mirror and

00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,139
Iceland probably takes a lot of

00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,760
resources it could probably just run off

00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:36,710
to the side of the Bitcoin mining so

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:38,120
yeah anyway Sipan activity still like

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,470
you so you'd think after 20 years one

00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,639
thing that at least it occurred to me is

00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,010
like can't we have like written

00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:44,899
everything by now but you look at the

00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,250
activity and yeah you might say well

00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:47,870
there's a little bit of it like if you

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,630
did a trend line maybe a little bit down

00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:52,820
but again it's just new stuff going up

00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,860
so there's literally thousands of module

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,429
updates still going on every year and

00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:01,279
hundreds of new distributions new stuff

00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:03,230
getting set up so I think that level of

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,880
activity is just absolutely amazing it

00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,340
this is all I get new code new things

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,570
getting updated new people getting

00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,669
involved and I just talked to somebody

00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:13,220
actually at dinner last night just set

00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:15,080
up there they're there pause ID first

00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,820
time within like the last two years so

00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,100
there's still people getting involved

00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:23,980
there's still a lot of signs of health

00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,980
and activity so I think that's fantastic

00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:29,090
again all the legacy of the 20 years

00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:32,179
also it's just all kinds of events it's

00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:34,490
not just code so prou mongers and tech

00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:36,139
meet meetups everywhere there's been

00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,460
Perl mongers groups I think on every

00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:39,409
continent I know there was one in

00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,419
Antarctica for a while there was a Perl

00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:44,809
guy down there so that covered probably

00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:46,100
one of the hardest to get continents you

00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:48,260
know hundreds and hundreds of Perl

00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,409
conferences and and workshops and all

00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,880
sorts of different events hackathons and

00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:54,350
we've been doing these even more

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,149
regularly I think over the last couple

00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,710
of years where the core people get

00:24:56,149 --> 00:25:01,309
together just to work on one particular

00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:03,919
topic so the QA folks the the testers

00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:05,120
who tests all of Sipan and that's again

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,950
all of the talks that people have given

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,960
about all the infrastructure around

00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,250
Japan

00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,680
and all sorts of different contributors

00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,750
getting together for these hackathons

00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,880
and just an extensive catalog and this

00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,410
is where I think foz and JT and all the

00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,570
people that have done video for the last

00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:22,510
several years we've got video almost

00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,680
every pro conference talked at least for

00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,570
the North America ones and they're all

00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,520
up on YouTube so for those of you who

00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,690
maybe are a little bit new to the

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,610
community and you think oh wow we're

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,990
there were there great talks there are

00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:34,120
great talks and go check them out

00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,530
they're all up on YouTube and we're

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,240
gonna continue to do that you'll see

00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:39,910
that there will be recording talks here

00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:44,140
at the conference all up free for

00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:46,720
everyone to to check out so in summary

00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,730
still kickin after 20 years and

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,140
literally the fastest moving industry

00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,020
that the world has ever known and that's

00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:56,290
not hyperbole we all know that IT right

00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:59,170
now things come and go very very quickly

00:25:56,290 --> 00:26:01,000
there are all sorts of fads with things

00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,770
and and I think that the staying power

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,720
has been absolutely amazing it's a very

00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,760
difficult industry to have that and

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,650
still a hun percent free and open for

00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:15,660
everyone at every platform so I think

00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:18,220
that's fantastic next for all of you

00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,510
alright so I was just told I got five

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,620
minutes left and this is actually what

00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:25,360
I'm supposed to talk about it's a

00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:27,100
profiling stuff so anyway so so what do

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,750
we do with the Pearl Foundation so as I

00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,150
mentioned we take in all the different

00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,020
donations so that we can support various

00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,580
things and there's a whole bunch of

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,900
other activities that we do when you've

00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,370
been around for twenty years and this is

00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,510
true probably all of you at the

00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,650
companies that you work at there's

00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,970
things that you have to replace after a

00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,140
while so one of the big things that

00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,820
we've been doing over the last couple of

00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,440
years is just revamping infrastructure a

00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,360
lot of this stuff as you can imagine

00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,920
that we set up when we first set up we

00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,910
just it was just coated people just

00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,309
coated up new things because there

00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:52,510
weren't things it's hard to imagine now

00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,650
with all the resources that are out

00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,970
there but there are a lot of things that

00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:57,250
just didn't exist so people made them

00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,770
and we've been replacing a lot of those

00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:02,770
things so TPF actually started in

00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:04,720
September of 2000 and one of the reasons

00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:06,730
actually the TPF got started was because

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,920
of the early AB C's to have an event

00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,080
like this one of the first criteria that

00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,420
the the hosting organization is going to

00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:16,210
have is do you have insurance and that

00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:18,070
was a big lift to ask an organizer who

00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,520
is like yeah I'll volunteer my time like

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,990
Oh cuz you like you know on your

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,700
Motors policy just you know right that

00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:24,860
it add that on would that be too much of

00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:28,430
a problem it turns out people balked at

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:31,820
that for some reason so an entity was

00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:33,290
created to be able to hold that

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,700
insurance and then obviously meant many

00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:38,600
other things were added after that so

00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,070
some of the documentation other

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,960
resources that we have we've had them in

00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:43,460
various things over the years we've

00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,860
started to move those to github so we

00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,480
have like a github organization and

00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,800
people can jump in and help out with

00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,270
that so we've been moving a lot of stuff

00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,190
there we had some some wiki's and things

00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:54,260
like that that were on previous Perl

00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,780
based stuff we move those over pearl

00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,340
calm we talked about this last year

00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,840
completely revamped so if you've not

00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,030
checked it out in a while it's all

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,140
completely redone new articles all the

00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:07,010
time

00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:09,320
really fantastic redo we redid the Perl

00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,550
Foundation org site again this was kind

00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,080
of driven by an older system where

00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,300
there's kind of a wiki and you would put

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,520
in content and it would get posted and

00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,890
now we're on a new new platform that's

00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,480
much easier for us to give out accounts

00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:24,170
and for people to update so we move that

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,270
stuff over and neon is a platform that

00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:28,760
Dan actually found in his other role as

00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:31,310
treasurer which is this other day job or

00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,110
other night job I guess compared to the

00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,940
other day job and that just helps us

00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,380
with managing all the donations so the

00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,300
very first incarnation of our donation

00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,070
management was homegrown written pro

00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,960
scripts then we went to another system I

00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:44,420
think donor comm for a couple of years

00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,490
and now now we've moved on to neon and

00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,290
again the resources now there's so many

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,640
other organizations doing kind of what

00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,840
we do now there's so much better than

00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,980
the things that we had back when we

00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,300
built them so it's just a matter of

00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,800
moving some of these things around a lot

00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,270
of the stuff is not glamorous but it has

00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,100
to be done and it's the things that sort

00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:02,090
of help the pro foundation keep moving

00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:05,060
forward the stuff we're working on right

00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:07,190
now for this year is a blog site update

00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,530
so that when I say the blog site this is

00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,660
the site at news dot Pro Foundation org

00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,950
so hopefully people go to that and check

00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,630
it out this is where we announce all the

00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,860
stuff that we do and typically a lot of

00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,690
posts about what are we doing with the

00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,640
money which is pretty much what people

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,600
want to know but other things do we just

00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:26,090
is where we communicate everything so

00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,040
it's on movable type which is Pro based

00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,320
and it's been on sort of the same sort

00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,179
of older version of movable type

00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:36,850
a long time and I'm not gonna make it

00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:38,740
but this is something we've been looking

00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,570
at you know possible upgrades I possibly

00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,480
upgrading movable-type but then a couple

00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:45,850
of years ago we had somebody do a

00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,259
presentation on something called rappy

00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,299
blog I thought that would be cool so

00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:50,830
Henry van Statten right here gave that

00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:52,450
presentation and somebody pointed me to

00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,500
it and I actually missed it I was at

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,779
Washington but I wouldn't watch the

00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,889
video because we have videos and I

00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:58,179
thought this would be great so we've

00:29:56,889 --> 00:29:59,889
actually working on we got a demo site

00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:01,840
right now Henry's already got that set

00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:03,460
up we're testing it out so that's

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,679
hopefully going to be the next version

00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,450
of the of the blog site and it'll be

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,000
again 100% pearl which is always

00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,929
fantastic to be able to use Pro Tools

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,879
one of the big things we're working on

00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:15,970
right now and one of the last things the

00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:17,830
current site gets absolutely bombed with

00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,600
comments spam you would not believe like

00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,769
literally hundreds and hundreds of

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,240
comment spam all the time like people

00:30:20,769 --> 00:30:23,500
that's like there's people that just go

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,870
in and just clean that stuff out so

00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,159
adding things like CAPTCHAs and things

00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,330
like that is something that we're

00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,190
working on just because it's just for

00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:33,879
our own preservation so apologize in

00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:35,320
advance he's going to do the CAPTCHA and

00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:36,970
I apologize in advance yes there will be

00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,259
a CAPTCHA of some sort but again we just

00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,450
get absolutely hammered with the

00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:41,980
comments spam and that's time that

00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,289
somebody can't do something else okay

00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,450
other activities again this is other

00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:48,519
stuff that we support conferences

00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,929
workshops general project grants and

00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:52,750
that's the project one so this is where

00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:53,980
any of you can submit an idea and maybe

00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,019
you just need a little bit of funding to

00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,429
either encourage you to do it or maybe

00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:59,049
there's you know it's just some cost or

00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:00,070
for your time so these are the things

00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:01,720
that people do you can see all those

00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,740
updates on the new site there's a grants

00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,230
group they look at all your stuff that

00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,340
comes in if it gets approved then once

00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,870
you complete your grant you can get paid

00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,250
for it for your time so that's pretty

00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:11,019
cool if you did not know about that so

00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,759
that's something that we fund there's

00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:14,980
also grants long-running grants for

00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:16,299
pro/5 in pro six development now all of

00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,639
this is still open-source there's still

00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:21,370
whole groups that contribute and work on

00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:23,950
all of these these projects Pro 5 and

00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:26,350
Pro 6 but there are a few folks that we

00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,730
have fun some of their time for like the

00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,200
really hard bugs the things that people

00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:31,299
prioritize maybe if there's a security

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,789
issue things like that so we fund some

00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:35,110
of that less exciting things like

00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:36,309
trademark renewal and you might say well

00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:39,580
your open source why do you need a

00:31:36,309 --> 00:31:41,289
trademark and really its defensive if we

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,580
have a trademark if we didn't have a

00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:42,940
trademark on pearl someone else can go

00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,280
claim

00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,930
and then claim to be pearl so we've gone

00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,690
out as pearl foundation and defensively

00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:52,270
acquired the trademark in I think four

00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,180
different the major areas where it's

00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:57,580
enforced so US Canada EU and Japan

00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,170
I think Dan's nodding so those are the

00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,580
four that we've gone out and sort of

00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:02,860
gotten and then those renewals come up

00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,480
so we take care of stuff like that

00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,140
we support the the Unicode Unicode

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,850
consortia so we're part of that and

00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,020
again watch news dot Pro Foundation out

00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,670
or if you just want to see like all the

00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,890
different stuff that we do there's tons

00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,960
more than I can go through right here so

00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:18,790
again all of that stuff that we do we're

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,920
pretty much the money part of that and

00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,210
it's thanks to the corporate donors

00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,740
individual donors we still get

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:26,440
individual donations which is fantastic

00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:28,720
this is all of you sending us some money

00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,370
and a really really easy way that every

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,750
single person in this room can donate

00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:36,640
and not cost you anything is smile

00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:39,790
amazon.com so if you use Amazon at all

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,170
the smile site is a portion of Amazon

00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,640
where they'll take part of everything

00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:45,370
that you buy and they give it to some

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,380
charity so we are registered in there as

00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:49,120
I mentioned is yet another Society so if

00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,680
you go set up your Amazon account set up

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,900
yet another Society and then remember go

00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,160
to smile whenever you go to Amazon we'll

00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,960
get a little bit at the end of the year

00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,880
so that's an easy way that literally

00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:02,010
everybody could go and and donate a

00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:04,540
little bit okay last topic I promise

00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:06,040
succession planning so I don't know if

00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,020
everyone knows exactly what this term

00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,370
means but basically it's a common idea

00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,840
you can see it in government's right

00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,280
let's we have a democratic government

00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,420
someone's leaving someone's coming you

00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,530
do some planning to make sure there's

00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,050
some handoffs in there and make sure

00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:19,330
things go smoothly happens at companies

00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:20,800
everyone knows of people that oh if that

00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,150
person left things would be really rough

00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,860
so companies try to make sure that

00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,710
there's backups and and things like that

00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:29,170
so this is a common idea and government

00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:31,570
common idea in companies and it's also

00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:33,460
becoming a much more common idea in

00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,560
open-source there's all sorts of

00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,210
projects out there again 20 years is

00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,630
also about the timeframe at least when

00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:41,980
the term open source' was coined by Tim

00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,780
O'Reilly at some of the O'Reilly

00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,430
conferences obviously free software was

00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,960
around for a while before that but

00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,670
really you saw all the people getting in

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,450
20 years is a long time for individuals

00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:54,960
to maintain code projects modules things

00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,960
on Sipan

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,440
so this is people are starting to think

00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,870
about succession planning in terms of

00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,549
those projects as well now there's a lot

00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:08,569
of different reasons why someone might

00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:10,609
need to step down from a project it's

00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:12,530
not always voluntary right so you could

00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:14,450
have something like this can happen

00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,099
which can be unfortunate but sometimes

00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:17,629
people are just tired right and it's

00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:20,329
just time like maybe you know it's time

00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:21,800
for me to step aside because I've done a

00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:22,819
lot of work and I just need some time

00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,760
off

00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:28,069
there's happier scenarios like winning

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,629
the lottery right so you know maybe once

00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:31,190
you won the lottery you know some people

00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:32,389
say oh I just I would do more open sores

00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,030
but you know maybe some people would

00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:36,710
want to take a break and then there's

00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,169
just getting distracted right there

00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,429
might be something else that might be of

00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:44,210
interest to you and you want to go work

00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:45,829
on that so you'd rather go work on that

00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:48,169
you need to pass on whatever it is that

00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:50,060
you're doing to someone else so right

00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:54,829
squirrel get it the dog the squirrel

00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:56,629
yeah what squirrel thank you okay so we

00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:57,770
think about this with TPF because it's

00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:59,630
just like an open-source project you

00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,530
need to have some continuity as you pass

00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,790
things through so one of the things

00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,920
we've been doing over the past couple of

00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,839
years is continuing to add people to the

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,700
board Dave Ross key I think was the most

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:13,130
recent for this last year so thank you

00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:15,680
David some of the other longtime board

00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,690
members have expressed interest in one

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,030
of those options above maybe not the bus

00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,380
thing but maybe some of the others you

00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,609
know being tired or moving on I don't

00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,050
know that any of them any of them have

00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:26,420
won the lottery at least that the not

00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:27,859
that they told me but so we've continued

00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,480
to add more board members so that people

00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:31,099
can kind of smoothly move off but we

00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,130
still have continuity right and that's

00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:36,619
the the key part of it so some other key

00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:39,349
roles that this year we will also be

00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:41,119
transitioning me is one of the ones it's

00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:42,470
gonna be transitioning out so we have

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,260
been working for quite a while many

00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:47,089
months on finding candidates for

00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,740
president there are special requirements

00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:50,540
for this role that are a little bit

00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,040
different from the board but we think we

00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:54,410
have a really good candidate and I

00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:57,410
should be posting details later today or

00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:59,060
tomorrow about who that candidate is and

00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,619
as we've done with if people haven't

00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:03,530
seen on the news Crow foundation Network

00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:05,349
site we do a period of public comment

00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,609
now - a lot of people we're not like a

00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:08,500
voting organization so it's not like we

00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:09,790
put it out for a

00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,970
but we do allow people to sort of

00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:13,960
comment on people before the board just

00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,490
goes and votes because I think

00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,320
previously it felt very much like we

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,730
were excited that secret society and we

00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,930
would just post like hey this new person

00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:22,210
came up and people were kind of

00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:25,750
surprised by it so I'll be posting that

00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:27,310
later and we are also looking for new

00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,890
treasure as I mentioned that's dams

00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,330
other not day job and he's also been in

00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:32,470
that role for a long time

00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:34,840
and so we've been talking about that

00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,400
also for a couple of months as the how

00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,980
to transition that these are probably

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,380
the two most active roles in TPF so

00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,450
they're important ones and so to the

00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:45,280
point of succession planning dan and I

00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,540
have both committed to help out the new

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,580
person we're not going to disappear

00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:51,250
we're gonna sort of shadow these people

00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,510
probably for a year that may sound a

00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,710
little bit crazy but there's certain

00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,810
things that only happen on a yearly

00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:57,040
cycle so we kind of want to be around so

00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,300
that whatever those things are when they

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,109
come up we can kind of be like oh this

00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:04,840
is how we've done it in the past so yeah

00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:05,680
and then the most important how can you

00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,240
help because what you're all thinking

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,310
right like oh wow that's all great you

00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,260
guys are doing all the stuff but me how

00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:15,280
can I get involved how can I help right

00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:17,500
well I'm glad that you asked pro

00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,060
foundation site webmaster as I mentioned

00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,770
we moved it over to a like a WYSIWYG

00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,750
platform it's super easy you do not need

00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:24,760
to be a coder and this would just be

00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,380
somebody to just help clean up stuff on

00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,970
the site we did move it all over but it

00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,470
still needs lots of cleanup plus we want

00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,910
to help people different editors there's

00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,200
people who get in and they only edit

00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,690
like once in a while so if there was

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,460
like a resource they could go to and get

00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:39,730
help on that stuff that would be a huge

00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,080
help once we get the blog up I'm

00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:42,820
assuming like it'd be helpful to have an

00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,070
admin to do things like accounts and

00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,900
stuff like that so maybe it could be the

00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:49,210
same role or maybe not conference

00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,530
organizer Lena mentioned this is that

00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:53,080
there's a group that really works all

00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:56,170
year round on this that's a great way if

00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,670
you have fun at this conference and you

00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,109
see kind of people running around or you

00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,070
just think these Swank t-shirts or

00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:02,560
something that you would like to add to

00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:04,420
your collection then think about being

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,910
conference organizer it starts off

00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,080
slowly as far as after this year before

00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,270
next year sort of ramps up there's a

00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,160
slack group so you can just get involved

00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:15,010
there's discussion there so it's a

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,119
pretty easy ramp up as far as something

00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,260
you might want to participate in and

00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:19,000
then obviously as the conference comes

00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,599
closer there's calls zoom calls and

00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,670
things like that

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,259
and activity increases but that's a

00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,219
great way many people have gotten

00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:27,119
involved this way that's how I got

00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:29,739
started was working through conferences

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,759
grants committee as I mentioned there's

00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:32,769
two roles in the grants committee

00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:34,239
there's the the grants committee members

00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,949
and they just vote on all of the all of

00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:37,900
your submissions and then there's also

00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:39,729
grant manager and they're the people who

00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,140
watch the grants and then basically

00:38:39,729 --> 00:38:42,459
decide when they've been completed so

00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,349
that we should we should pay it out so

00:38:42,459 --> 00:38:46,390
super important roles so there's

00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:47,829
openings right now they also have some

00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,690
people who are stepping down so if

00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:51,509
you're interested in the Grants Program

00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,680
you can step forward and do that

00:38:51,509 --> 00:38:56,140
simplest thing you could possibly do

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,449
write an article for Perl calm it's all

00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,099
a really cool automated system through

00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:02,140
github where you just do like a pull

00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:03,489
request and send it in so if there's a

00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,869
really cool talk that you go to while

00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:06,249
you're here or if you're giving a talk

00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:08,469
and after you kind of recover from all

00:39:06,249 --> 00:39:10,660
the time doing your slides write up an

00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:12,609
article sort of short version of your

00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,640
talk everybody in this room could

00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:16,779
contribute an article for procom so kind

00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,699
of help you something that you can point

00:39:16,779 --> 00:39:20,619
out you know from your resume that you

00:39:18,699 --> 00:39:22,569
did this and also it helps prolong

00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:23,920
because we'd like to see new faces on

00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:25,150
there there's a lot of the contributors

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,910
or folks that contribute a lot so

00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:29,199
everybody can do that

00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:30,459
TPF marketing this is another role this

00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:32,319
is like the social media stuff helping

00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:34,239
us out with Twitter and Facebook and all

00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:36,670
that kind of stuff so if anybody sort of

00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,279
has those talents or is interested and

00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,809
the other thing this is the lowest bar

00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:43,329
of everything that something that

00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:45,130
everyone here can do is just do some

00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:47,680
social media about your experience here

00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,880
at the conference right so tweet we

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,009
probably the lowest bar the very

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,359
simplest thing that you could do but if

00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:54,130
you do Facebook whatever the social

00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:55,869
media is that you do as Dan mentioned

00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:59,380
the hashtag it's a little bit

00:39:55,869 --> 00:40:02,019
challenging it's not tcp/ip I've made

00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,089
that mistake several times already but

00:40:02,019 --> 00:40:06,219
it's close to that but please please do

00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:08,019
this take some time to do this because

00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:10,059
this is just a huge way that it helps

00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:12,719
just get more positive sort of pearl

00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:16,630
information out there in the community I

00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:18,759
promise I'm almost done so just a few

00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:20,890
suggestions before you go off and start

00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:22,809
to enjoy the the formal conference learn

00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,459
something new I always do when I come

00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:25,660
here I've come to many many many of

00:40:24,459 --> 00:40:27,190
these conferences and you think you know

00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,380
what could possibly be knew about pearl

00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:31,630
and every time I come there's something

00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,650
new and also something completely

00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:35,110
relevant for somebody I'm work

00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:37,990
so this year I started to play around

00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:39,640
with some WebSockets and I wanted to do

00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:41,890
it with Perl obviously so I go look at

00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:45,310
the the schedule and there's a talk on

00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:47,470
WebSockets in Perl so it's always TBC is

00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,970
always right there when I need it so I

00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,750
encourage everybody hopefully learned

00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,910
something new

00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,850
meet some new people one of the people

00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:56,920
at the alt dinner last night I think one

00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:59,530
at least provisionally the Award for

00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,090
Best socializing he walked around the

00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,650
table introduced himself to every single

00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:05,350
person I thought that was absolutely

00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:07,330
fantastic so meet some new people Dan

00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:09,190
said there's a mixer later so we try to

00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:11,470
help facilitate this the badges and that

00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:13,330
whole thing so meet some new people have

00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,530
fun so hopefully this one is super easy

00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:16,950
and you don't actually have to try at it

00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:19,780
and the last one is just be inspired

00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:22,030
I've walked out of these with new energy

00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,230
every year I'm always inspired by the

00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:26,020
different projects the different things

00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:28,000
that people work on and you know the

00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:30,160
reality distortion field is not always a

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,290
force for evil a lot of things a lot of

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,930
projects have been launched from within

00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,820
the reality distortion field and that's

00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:38,410
basically the people get crazy when

00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,910
conferences and start talk about things

00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,960
that you know they would never do when

00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:42,670
they were in their right state of mind

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,250
but some great things have been inspired

00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,890
by that so don't don't let that let that

00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,060
be a force for good

00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:51,900
have a great conference that's all for

00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,900
me thanks

00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,499
