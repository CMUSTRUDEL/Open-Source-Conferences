Title: James E. Keenan - "Multisection: When Bisection Isn't Enough to Debug a Problem"

Description: 
	Bisection is a developer's tool customarily used to identify the single point in a series of change sets for a given codebase where the code's behavior changed on a given platform. Typically, we perform bisection when a test has begun to fail and we want to identify the change set where that failure first appeared.

There are, however, circumstances in which, over the course of many change sets, a given test might fail in multiple, different ways. In that case, *how* something failed becomes more important than simply *that* something failed. We may need to capture the output of the testing process at multiple transition points for later human examination. In that case we need a tool for "multiple bisection" -- or, for short, "multisection."

I developed CPAN distribution Devel-Git-MultiBisect to provide such a tool and have used it in debugging both build failures and test failures in the Perl 5 core distribution. In this presentation, however, I will not focus on the details of that library but will rather try to have attendees develop an understanding of the kind of problems for which multisectioning is appropriate.
