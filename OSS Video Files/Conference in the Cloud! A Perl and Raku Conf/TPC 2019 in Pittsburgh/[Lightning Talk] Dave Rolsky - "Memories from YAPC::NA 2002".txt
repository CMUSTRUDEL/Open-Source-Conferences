all right I dug deep for this one so

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,889
this is a talk I gave at Yap see 2002 it

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,710
was like a 50-minute session I will not

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:16,650
subject you to the full thing obviously

00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:18,960
so how many of you have used DivX class

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,500
probably many people it's pretty good

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,289
right

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,090
so before demux class there was this

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,740
thing called class TBI of it depicts

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,970
class kind of replaced but what many

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,250
people don't know because they never

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,560
used it but they should have is that

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,040
right when class TBI was released I also

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,430
released an ORM called al Szabo which is

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,500
I believe arabic for hyena or the hyena

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,090
and comes from a book by gene wolfe

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,850
who's one of my favorite authors rest in

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,579
peace gene wolfe so anyway I gave a talk

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,969
about this I do not use this ORM for

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,250
God's sakes but you know it's kind of

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,930
you know I didn't even know what in orem

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,690
was when I wrote this I was just like I

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,239
need this thing because writing all this

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,410
equals tedious so yeah I called it a

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,539
data modeling tool with the web

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,159
interface because you could also use it

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,950
to write your you'll create your schema

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,659
and all that it even had some cool

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,250
features like you could create multiple

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,530
like you create a schema and then save

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,080
it to disk you realize it then update

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,460
the schema and code and then read the

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,110
serialize scheme I'll give you a diff

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,600
and essentially apply the changes which

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,110
hey that was clever yeah over a

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,460
relational object mapper I don't know I

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,500
didn't know what this is called so

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:34,530
anyway it looks kind of like this oh

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,729
okay yeah no I'll get to the other parts

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,650
so it looks pretty straightforward right

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,119
you're gonna get the movie table and

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,380
insert something and update and delete

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,880
it and then this is like a really boring

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,100
talk because there's just like three or

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,530
four pages of just code examples I hope

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,549
I've gotten better since then don't tell

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,899
me if I have it but just lie please so

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,430
you could do all sorts of stuff and you

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,560
could iterate over it you know you could

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,100
get a cursor and you could do joins and

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,990
you know it was pretty decent and so you

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,350
know here's some features and by the way

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,209
so these features are still apparently

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,830
revolutionary because okay so first

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:11,660
feature can do almost any sort of query

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,580
enjoyed including

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,680
joints well I've been trying to find

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,350
over or M for go and I'm the best one I

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,420
found doesn't even do outer joins it's

00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,640
like come on guys I mean this is basic

00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,960
database stuff and I thought it was bad

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,910
because it was missing intersection

00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,490
Union a difference which ironically I

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,860
don't think of ever I've used Union a

00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,480
few times I in my career since 2002 I

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,110
don't think I've ever used intersection

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,070
or difference

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:39,080
I had lazy loading all sorts of clever

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,610
caching which was a complete waste of

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,410
time I wrote this cache that would like

00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,060
serialize data to the database and read

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,650
it back later and then eventually I got

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,450
around to like timing all the caching

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,340
and because it was like pluggable you

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,290
could catch a file or berkeley DB here

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,730
the database itself a time to all of

00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,500
them the only one that was worth

00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,240
anything was just cashing in memory all

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,430
the other much more complicated ones

00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,870
took so long to operate that you were

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,980
better off just fetching the data again

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:06,230
but hey it was fun to write what else

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,540
did it do yeah I knew about your schema

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,100
it would have this whole method audio

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,860
generation system where you could

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:15,050
generate classes that would use the like

00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,840
table objects and give you additional

00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,000
methods it was like kind of crazy I

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,620
don't know what I was thinking I did use

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,930
it for a few of my projects but don't

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,820
think many other people ever used it

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,230
maybe nobody here

00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,170
somebody here used it but doesn't even

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,280
want to admit it I don't know yeah I did

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,410
all sorts of stuff so you can make

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,660
potential rows and then make them live

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,500
by inserting them it would generate

00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,120
documentation for you oh and by the way

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,520
like do you guys like the sick logo in

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,510
the upper left I can't remember but I

00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,160
think I made it myself I just assumed I

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:58,760
made it myself because it's pretty you

00:03:49,160 --> 00:04:00,140
know rough yeah rad rad sick beast so

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,850
yeah if you want to find out more about

00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,920
it you could try to go to this domain

00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,720
which I have not renewed for over ten

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,670
years but who knows what's there

00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,400
actually no I shouldn't say this cuz

00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,080
like who knows what's there and like I'm

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,640
on the standards of contact committee do

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,600
not go to just some random to a meme you

00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:22,190
see on the slide

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:23,419
stay away oh really oh sweet I can own

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,479
it again

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,949
I have enough domains and apparently

00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:29,509
okay so somebody else was using it

00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:32,479
because this guy wrote an article about

00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:34,340
it Reuben Lerner so that was cool

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,889
are there any questions about the ORM

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,599
apparently that's oh okay so one last

00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:40,159
thing so that was the presentation but

00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:42,379
here's the really interesting thing

00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:45,650
about this presentation that I'm showing

00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:48,409
you now I don't know what tool I use to

00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,779
make this these slides maybe it was

00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:53,120
OpenOffice I don't know all I know is I

00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:54,529
went and found I have this projects

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,930
folder with all my projects and I have

00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:59,029
an old junk folder and there and I have

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,620
the al-sabah website folder and there

00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:01,969
and I looked in htdocs' and there was a

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,050
presentations folder and I was like

00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,090
great I have the presentation and

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:09,439
apparently the way it was exported is

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:11,629
there's like these HTML pages each of

00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,990
which just has an image and like the

00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:16,939
slides alike like this is a page and all

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,009
the rest of is an image and here's the

00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:20,330
really cool thing that I did the images

00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:22,339
were really small when it pulled it up

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:26,689
and I read some Perl to go in and hack

00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:28,939
in this CSS that you see here to make it

00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:31,320
readable so hey Perl still useful for

00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:31,410
ancient presentations thank you

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,949
