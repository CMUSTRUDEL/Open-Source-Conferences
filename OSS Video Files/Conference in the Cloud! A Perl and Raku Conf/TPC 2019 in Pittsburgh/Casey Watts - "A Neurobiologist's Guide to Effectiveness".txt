alright looks like everybody is sort of

00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,240
coming back and coming and going but

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:14,280
we've got to keep on schedule so I want

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:17,670
to introduce casey watts he gave he gave

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,609
a very well-received keynote talk at the

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:24,029
DC baltimore pearl workshop which we put

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:27,750
on earlier this year and I felt that his

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,260
message was so important that I invited

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,779
him

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,920
well I nominate I nominated him to come

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,420
here and he was accepted to come here to

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,550
expand on that topic so if you were at

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,050
DC baltimore pearl workshop you may have

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,360
seen part of this talk but you certainly

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,270
haven't seen it all he's got a lot in

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:55,350
store for us so without further ado

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:58,320

good to see you well I'm gonna tell

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,850
start by telling you a little bit more

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,070
about me one of my favorite things is it

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,070
bubbles in the summer I host bubble

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,200
parties in Dupont Circle in DC I have

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,549
this much bubble equipment a crate I

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,250
have to take it crate I have one of

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,500
those shopping carts that I take it's a

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,420
lot of fun I love music I play several

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,400
instruments in DC Square marching band

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,369
we do every pride parade in the area

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,740
yeah I like it when my instruments match

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,479
my hair in the bottom that's me playing

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,400
a bass drum dressed as a pirate at a

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,259
Halloween swing dance which I also

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,909
danced at it's like a lot of me in one

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:47,250
picture there at some point I was a

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,899
teacher at Yale University through the

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,189
IT department a tech boot camp that they

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,829
did in the summer so if you see some

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,880
teacher isms in this talk you will you

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,680
know where that comes from I'm giving

00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,750
you homework no joke I was a software

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,460
developer for 10 years the most recent

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,799
few were at Heroku which he may have

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,030
deployed some apps on now recently I've

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,580
switched to being a product manager for

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,629
the US government working on immigration

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,830
for refugee and asylum seekers I grew up

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,510
in Baltimore lived

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,150
New Haven for eight years and now I'm

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:22,530
back in DC I love DC I did some

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,450
neurobiology research while I was at

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,970
Yale and there are three papers I'm a

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,830
co-author on second author they're very

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,620
technical you can see slices like rat

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,940
brain slice images there that's the kind

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,960
of work I was doing it's not relevant to

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,430
this talk but if you wanna look it up

00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,840
later it's um PubMed you can find it a

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,490
little more about me and do you think

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,660
I'm anxious or excited I'm up here on

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:48,780
stage both yeah I hear I hear both in

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,850
the air let's talk about that real quick

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,459
they're very similar phenomenon in the

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,290
body if you're studying it in psychology

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,270
setting you might say physiologically

00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,770
aroused my heartbeat is probably a

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,750
little fast right now my pupils are

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,630
dilated I bet I'm not looking but it

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,070
it's what happens I say the difference

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,990
between anxious and excited is what

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,150
outcome do I expect it's going to have

00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,620
so if I expect a bad outcome I'm gonna

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,190
be anxious if I expect a good one I'm

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,350
gonna be excited but what if I'm not

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,490
sure well most people if you're not sure

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,900
you're gonna think on the bad parts

00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,540
we're gonna focus on that so most people

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,190
up here on stage especially the first

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,180
few times would be very anxious I bet

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,519
because you're not sure how it's gonna

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,230
turn out and let's be real that's not

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:33,360
the amount of uncertainty it's like it

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:34,709
this much one of the tricks that I'm

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,970
going to talk through a few times in

00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:40,620
this talk is called reframing that large

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,959
black bar in the middle was me thinking

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,190
what could go wrong but instead I could

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,110
think what could go right I could

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,610
actually improve someone's life through

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,769
my talk if there's even one person here

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,970
whose life changes thanks to this that's

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,709
pretty good I love it so I am excited

00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,300
I'm pretty excited I'm confident it's

00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,890
gonna go well for at least enough of you

00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,970
to make it worth my time being here and

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,730
thank you all for paying attention

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,010
listening all that let's talk about you

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,180
now I bet you're a little tired of

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,860
sitting I'm glad you took a stretch

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,880
break just now if you did you're

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,640
probably thinking about lunch

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,080
I am lunch is after this talk you might

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,630
even be hungry if you're like a little

00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,700
grumpy that's a word it's a portmanteau

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,660
hungry and angry you put it together

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:24,990
that's hangry so I want to reframe that

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,850
those thoughts let's how about you're

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,639
curious about brains your hears about

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,590
this talk York

00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,030
about me and what about to tell you and

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,289
maybe you describe the coffee and you

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,509
can feel the caffeine coursing through

00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,860
your veins that's a little bit more

00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:38,620
useful right now for paying attention to

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,270
me better thanks I uh

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,159
now the meet at the talk there's two

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,990
halves of the talk this is a double

00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:45,129
whammy the description says the first

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,990
part is called the bucking your brain

00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:48,520
and I'm actually turning that into a

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,050
book right now it's halfway it's all the

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,210
way written halfway edited which means

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,340
I'm halfway done the work editing is so

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,990
much of it the second half the talk is

00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,460
going to be not about inside your brain

00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,749
but about your team's you work with

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,400
psychological safety how to make your

00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:05,379
team's effective based on psychology

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,150
research I do have a lot of notes and

00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:08,620
articles I linked to and homework

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,939
that I assign you and I'm going to point

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,529
to that through the talk a few times and

00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:12,639
if you want to see a recording this will

00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:14,349
have a recording which is probably the

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,189
best one as soon as that's up in the

00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:17,949
meantime you gonna share it with

00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,629
co-workers friends family the Embera do

00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:25,259
I did two years ago was a pretty good

00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:28,089
one alright Part A debugging your brain

00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,729
I'm gonna go through like this I'm gonna

00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:31,719
start at one opportunities we're gonna

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:32,889
talk about all the opportunities where

00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:34,240
this might be useful and then I'm gonna

00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:35,979
talk about how the brain works like

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,150
starting for another point and then

00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:39,279
they're gonna feed together into

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,680
cognitive behavioral therapy which I'll

00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,979
define once we get there so the

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,430
opportunities part is now I drew that

00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:49,719
with an Apple pencil a downward spiral

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,800
is when you were having negative

00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:52,750
thoughts and negative feelings about a

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,979
situation and they make you have more

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,360
negative thoughts and feelings and you

00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,800
just feel worse and worse and worse the

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,669
more you think about it you've probably

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,229
experienced this some examples once

00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:03,279
maybe you had an argument at work they

00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,479
got out of control and made you feel

00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,020
awful and you thought about it for a

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,639
long time if you have kids you might

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,990
snap at them sometimes you might feel

00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,120
bad about it then feel guilty as a

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,469
parent oh no like that happens that

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,439
happened my mom once I have a story

00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:18,819
coming up once I was on my way to a

00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,339
meet-up to give I think this

00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:23,289
presentation probably and I was hangry I

00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:24,550
didn't eat yet and I was wet it was

00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:27,610
raining and I was running late and I

00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:30,009
stepped in the puddle I was focused on

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,460
what happened the rumination okay let me

00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:34,659
define this word rumination is focusing

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,039
on the bad parts instead of the good

00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,879
parts and you think about it and it

00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,550
makes you have a downward spiral

00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,410
thinking about the negative causes that

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,030
got you into this bad situation and

00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,850
the negative outcomes of it and it makes

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,920
you feel worse instead I tried to think

00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,270
of the solutions the ways to get myself

00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,980
into a better state or ways of

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,480
preventing it in the future might make

00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,590
me feel better too in this case there

00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,390
was pizza at the Meetup

00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,770
I was looking for it eating that pizza

00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,080
and I told myself you can take your

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,550
shoes off if they're soaking wet nobody

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,510
will mind really it's fine and in fact

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,410
someone else might do it and they'll

00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,410
love that you started it

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:11,080
cool that's enough for opportunities you

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,670
see this the stuff I'm telling might be

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:17,770
useful to your life if you have if any

00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:19,720
of that was relatable so I'm gonna give

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,980
you two neurobiology ideas now the

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,540
universe is outer brain and then we're

00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:26,410
gonna system model the brain in our

00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:32,050
versus outer brain I'm gonna illustrate

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:34,120
with this jiff oh that poor kitty don't

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,430
do this to your cat that cat is really

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,040
afraid so two things are happening right

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,870
in this gift the cat sees the cucumber

00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,720
gets scared that's a very quick

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,160
immediate remotion emotion fear and then

00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,540
I imagine right after the fact the cat

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,190
looks at it goes up smells it and like

00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,900
says okay just cucumber it's fine like

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:53,080
that's the slower thinking part of the

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,880
brain Thinking Fast and Slow are the two

00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,170
different parts of the brain and I think

00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,640
this dichotomy is a lot more useful than

00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:00,910
left-hemisphere right-hemisphere is in

00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,220
our versus outer so the feelings the

00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,230
quick part the fast part is in the

00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,700
inside of the brain I drew I drew that

00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:10,540
with my Apple pencil - I'm getting it to

00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,310
be an artist lately it's nicknamed the

00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,680
low road and it's really fast on the

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,470
scale of milliseconds it's that's the

00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,090
the quick jump response thoughts have to

00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,680
go a lot farther they have to go all the

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,240
way around this brain loop on the

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,740
outside it's slower that's on the scale

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,470
of seconds they can't had to think about

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,520
it and those that's the to think that

00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,360
feelings happened very quickly and

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,360
thoughts happened a little slower

00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:39,810
alright next let's model the brain as a

00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:41,729
system you might have seen this diagram

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,620
before I'm lucky I had an eighth-grade

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,689
engineering class I don't know that's

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,670
really cool I'm glad they did this is

00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:49,949
the engineer system as my teacher called

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,079
it or the IPO model input process output

00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:54,059
and the feedback loop is pretty

00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:55,769
important the eighth grade example I had

00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:57,870
was a thermostat so the room temperature

00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,339
is the input to the thermostat then the

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,649
thermostat compares it to the value

00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,269
you've set and if it's higher than it

00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:04,259
puts the a/c on if it's lower the heat

00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:05,910
or whatever it does that that's the

00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:07,680
output and then it spits the hot or cold

00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,480
air into the room and that's the

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,740
feedback loop the air becomes that

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,189
temperature which turns into the input

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:16,019
all right so that's the IPO model let's

00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:17,850
model an animal using this we might

00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,399
simplify and say that they just respond

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,079
to their environment Pavlov's dog in the

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,129
traditional psychology experiment you

00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:24,809
rang a bell and the dog would salivate

00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,759
because the dog knew food was coming

00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:28,949
that would be input/output very

00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,839
simplified model we like to think we

00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:32,899
humans have conscious thought which

00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:37,230
makes us very different from animals

00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:38,399
except when we're on autopilot when

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,959
we're on autopilot we're not really

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,309
processing we're not thinking thoughts

00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,509
so deliberately we're just kind of

00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:44,639
responding to our environment it happens

00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:47,600
to us too just like you might imagine it

00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:50,189
would to animals and you're thinking

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,959
actively I would use the term mind photo

00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,100
to describe that and if you ever hear

00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,180
the word mindful you think that's a

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,680
weird word I don't know what I mean I

00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,180
think it just means being consciously

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:04,649
aware and influencing your thoughts

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:06,300
that's my use of the word mindful so

00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:07,589
thoughts and feelings we just talked

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,149
about those and now we have this model

00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:11,430
I'm gonna put them together so you have

00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:13,019
as inputs automatic feelings like if you

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:16,290
saw a cucumber you might jump that's an

00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:18,720
automatic feeling of fear automatic

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,399
thoughts like that's so scary yeah I

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,230
don't you might like your words words

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,259
and thoughts are kind of relate they're

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,519
like the same thing for this talk those

00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:28,170
are automatic and I would consider those

00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,029
inputs that you did not decide to be

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,639
afraid of that thing you did not decide

00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:34,170
to think that it's scary but you can

00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,050
think deliberate thoughts right after

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,879
the fact and say wait a minute and I

00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,189
like anything that you influence control

00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,809
your brain that's a deliberate thought

00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:45,059
can you have a deliberate feeling not

00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,740
quite you can influence them using your

00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:47,060
thoughts so I want to put that as part

00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,920
of the

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,150
process part two so anytime you have

00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,070
deliberate thoughts that's your

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,500
influencing that's the process the

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,880
consciousness so the consciousness is

00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,740
this middle column the process and

00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,120
you're responsible for that part and

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,860
you're not really responsible for the

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,210
inputs that are on the left

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:11,300
you're just responsible for taking note

00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:12,860
of them and so with that all applies

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,290
when you're on a downward spiral you

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,870
want to influence the situation there

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:21,320
how do you do it we're gonna optimize

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,880
this system together that came together

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,480
neater than it ever has in these talks

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,480
Wow

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,380
so that's the trick the way they

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:34,310
optimize the system in my book is

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:36,230
cognitive behavioral therapy it's used

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:39,080
to treat most mental illnesses when I

00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,060
was in psych undergrad 101 and I had to

00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,590
do a test and this was an answer is

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,360
always the answer it was like circling

00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,360
see on a math test it was just always it

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:53,060
CBT is as effective as antidepressant

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,130
drugs for treating depression in some

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,930
studies it's like equivalent

00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:01,610
although the combined is more effective

00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:03,170
often you're probably thinking maybe I

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,420
think half the room might be thinking I

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,270
don't want therapy though I'm a healthy

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,580
individual I don't need therapy oh well

00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,810
let's call it training then cognitive

00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:17,360
behavioral training this can apply to

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:21,560
all of you I'm sure all right how do you

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:26,330
do cognitive behavioral training I just

00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,410
installed it it's run it it's so I have

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,880
to admit I'm not actually a pearl

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:33,080
developer I had someone help me with

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,180
this I did more Ruby and JavaScript so

00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,800
perpetual introspection like always be

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,480
monitoring yourself always be mindful

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,760
and thinking about the process using the

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,140
techniques we're about to cover so this

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,250
cause this parts called debugging your

00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,620
brain we're gonna have you hit a

00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,840
debugger breakpoint and inspect the

00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,130
context all of the local variables you

00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,980
have access to and the functions you

00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:57,170
might be able to call from where you are

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,280
reading code like just try to figure out

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,620
what the system is it's kind of a black

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,180
box you have to test it see what things

00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,440
they are going on and then there's a

00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,100
whole section on code smells and

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,180
refactoring that's my favorite part

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,550
all right how do you hit the debugger

00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,750
breakpoint in your brain I have a

00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:15,980
technique I came up with my mother

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:18,080
called the woop technique allow me to

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,570
illustrate here is my mom she just

00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,130
snapped at my brother cuz he left the

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,920
door open and then she felt bad about it

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:29,110
like she didn't mean to yell but you

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:33,530
know a little stress so she does this

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:35,180
what this like pauses her hits the

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,950
debugger breakpoint she's gonna take a

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,600
moment and think why am I upset hold on

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,000
hold on and stop everyone I don't know

00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,620
think we were quick that enters her into

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,810
the whoop state where she inspects

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,350
what's going on all of her inputs and

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,350
works with it

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,040
I'm proud that she'd stop she literally

00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,930
she didn't in that first moment that

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,180
exact story didn't say whoop yet but

00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,410
we've worked with her since then and now

00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,570
the whole family whoops her whenever we

00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:04,230
feel it she doesn't mind she's opted in

00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:06,029
to being whooped anytime she does take a

00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,310
moment to think about it that's that's a

00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:11,010
huge huge awesome thing that like is

00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:13,589
worth encouraging even if you don't know

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,060
what to do next you have to know how to

00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:17,100
hit the debugger before you know what to

00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,960
do while you're in the debugger so

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,160
hitting it is a great milestone all

00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,480
right cool let's say now we're experts

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,190
at hitting the debugger we always catch

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,240
it in the moment or after the fact and

00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:29,070
you can after the fact counts do let's

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,660
look at the context what what's going on

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,820
what's our local variables that we can

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,290
access we already talked about two of

00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,820
them the automatic thoughts and

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,170
automatic feelings those are inputs to

00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,410
your system so you have to take stock of

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:42,120
those and hopefully you can treat them

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,320
as input as data and you don't judge

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,060
them and be upset about them because

00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,490
that's helping you downward spiral if

00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,980
you do that instead there's two more I

00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,410
want to point out one is external

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,600
stimuli like events that happen to you

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,130
stuff that have it like phone call or

00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,040
meeting or something someone says or

00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:02,640
anything external to you is its own

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,650
category and then bodily state I taught

00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,020
you the portmanteau hangry just now

00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:09,300
there's a whole any bodily state you can

00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:12,240
have tired sleepy energized on caffeine

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,770
like me and it effects how your system

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,670
is going and that that counts to in my

00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:19,740
mom's case she was hangry that's why she

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,060
snapped and as soon as she realized that

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,610
she had some food and apologized and

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,810
everything was awesome great it happens

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,430
when you're a busy mom trying to take

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,850
care of kids like you can forget to eat

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,850
very easily

00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:36,540
all right next section reading code my

00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:38,360
metaphor is a little weaker here so a6

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,680
processing technique six techniques for

00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,320
figuring out what's going on in the code

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,910
base I'm going to go through one at a

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:51,089
time number one expanding your emotional

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,980
vocabulary if you have words to describe

00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:54,510
your feelings you're more able to think

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,589
of them notice them convey them to

00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,209
others coming them to yourself

00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:58,950
manipulate them in your head and work

00:15:57,209 --> 00:16:01,110
with them like if you have to name your

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,560
variable something better than X you're

00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,560
gonna work with it

00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,949
talking with close friends is my

00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:11,310
favorite technique because when I talk

00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:12,389
with a friend I get feedback from them I

00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:13,500
have to put it into words

00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:16,050
for them to understand and they

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,449
sometimes suggest ways of thinking and

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,910
describing my situation that helps me

00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:22,230
refine how I think of it it also helps

00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,209
like validate me and make a closer

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:27,899
friendship relationship and that's all

00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:30,060
really good too if I don't have a friend

00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,500
handy I could talk to a rubber duck it

00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,759
counts pretty well too if you had to put

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:37,699
into words for this entity on your desk

00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:39,630
putting into words is very powerful yeah

00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:41,459
another way of putting into words is

00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,630
journaling and I don't mean you have to

00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,060
have a daily journal by your bedside

00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:47,399
table that has a little lock on it but

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,529
just writing in any form to yourself or

00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,970
to to journal or to whatever you're

00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:52,649
imagining just writing it down writing

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,600
your thoughts down is a great way of

00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:55,019
processing and sometimes when I rubber

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,730
duck

00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,560
really--it's texting a slack message to

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,819
a co-worker which I delete because I

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,819
figured help the answer to the problem

00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:07,620
alright this next one might be

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:11,699
surprising to you reading fiction helps

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:13,110
you deal with processing your own

00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,569
thoughts and feelings because it helps

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,909
it's the only time you get a clear

00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:20,130
window into someone else's mind usually

00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:22,589
the narrator this is the first person

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,610
they're saying it and he felt scared and

00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:25,230
people don't know and they put all of

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,549
this into words and that can help you

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,689
put your own thoughts and feelings into

00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:29,490
words when it's relatable character

00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:31,200
there are studies that show the people

00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,659
who read more fiction have higher most

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,159
intelligence in some ways but this is

00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:38,929
great if anyone ever told you reading

00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:38,929
fiction is useless they're wrong sorry

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:45,960
alright my last one for this set is

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:47,789
meditation it's um the goal of

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,260
meditation is usually to not think and

00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:51,539
process the things but it can help you

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,350
identify what the inputs are any inputs

00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:54,539
you might have missed

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,580
so you just view the emotions and

00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,840
thoughts as inputs to your system in the

00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,850
state not don't judge them don't focus

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:06,600
on them just let them come by yeah so

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:08,100
that's those six maybe next time it'll

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:13,169
be even prettier diagrams but that's

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:14,340
what I got for now well I'm giving you a

00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:15,570
lot of information you see while I'm

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,789
giving you homework

00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,109
there's a lot in here all right next up

00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:21,239
code smells and refactoring techniques

00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:22,950
if you do cognitive behavioral therapy

00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:25,229
or read a book on it or anything like

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,789
that you will cover this these are the

00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:29,340
ten most common maladaptive thought

00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:31,440
patterns if you want more code smells

00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,940
Wikipedia has a list of more than 50 and

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,799
I think some of those are really useful

00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,929
too but here's the top 10 we're going to

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,049
talk about a few and I'd like you to

00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:41,369
print this we literally print it have a

00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:43,289
piece of paper out because if you can

00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:44,190
study these and get these ten down I've

00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,759
got to change the way you think about

00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:52,169
stuff I'm gonna give you some examples

00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:53,220
and apply these terms to that so that I

00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:54,830
told you when I was running late to the

00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,599
Meetup and I was wet and hungry I

00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,889
thought to myself automatic thought I

00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,859
didn't really come up with this but I

00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:03,359
said wet shoes are the worst I like and

00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:04,559
I was like hang on KC that's not like

00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,539
you you don't usually think this kind of

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,489
thought what's going on here I said I

00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:11,779
see I'm magnifying the situation I'm

00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:15,419
catastrophizing the worst I'm like I'm

00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:17,789
implicit is I thought to myself

00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,639
automatically again if I'm late I just

00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:22,739
shouldn't go nope uh-huh that's an

00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:24,269
example of all-or-nothing thinking it's

00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:25,769
like black and white thinking that

00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:27,749
either I'm going on time or I'm not

00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:29,159
going going late it but the point late

00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:32,460
is really fine it's fine

00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:36,259
it was fine I also thought this this is

00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:38,940
huge today sucks this gets three of them

00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:40,710
this is over generalizing the entire day

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,789
just qualifying all the positive stuff

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,559
that happened earlier in the day and

00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:46,830
it's jumping to conclusions that later

00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:49,349
in the day will also suck and when I

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,369
could I dreamt I noticed and I didn't

00:19:49,349 --> 00:19:51,599
even come up with all three of these at

00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:53,190
the time but I got one I was like yep

00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,259
this is a code smell I don't want to

00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:58,320
think this thought of today sucks let's

00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:59,519
try some more adaptive thought so

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,609
instead of those three I thought to

00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:05,309
myself I am feeling frustrated I didn't

00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:07,679
have quite the ring but it kind of

00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:09,419
diffused me which was the point the hang

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,399
greenness will go away when I eat I was

00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,840
trying to like solution trying to have

00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:14,340
that solution arrow not ruminate and

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,749
then I'll feel great after I dry off I

00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:21,479
told you it's gonna take my shoes off

00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:22,919
well that's those three you learned the

00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:24,539
loop technique for hitting your debugger

00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,159
breakpoint you can do it out loud if you

00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:28,369
want or you could do it quietly it's up

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,369
to you

00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:33,400
the context is automatic thoughts and

00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:35,170
feelings external stuff and bodily State

00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,310
that's how I would lay those out if you

00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,940
have others you can think of that's

00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:41,170
great add those to your list too for

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,760
reading code you got those six of motion

00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:45,310
processing techniques with those icons I

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,930
drew and code smells and refactoring is

00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,720
the ten maladaptive thought patterns

00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:52,090
that I want you to print out later if

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,950
you are into this there are even more

00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:56,350
tools that you have at your disposal

00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,780
want to seeing a therapist if you have

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,490
if being in public talking to strangers

00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,650
are stressful at all that could be a

00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:04,300
low-level social anxiety or hi I don't

00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,070
know and if you talk to a therapist they

00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,110
can help with this a lot it's like a

00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:10,590
personal trainer for your brain do you

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:13,540
want a brain trainer it sounds so good

00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,250
alright if therapist isn't your thing

00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,690
or if it is you might be a lot of

00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,420
therapists recommend the second one the

00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:22,480
CBT book feeling good but David Burns is

00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:24,040
the most prescribed book homework by

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,580
therapists by according to some studies

00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:29,260
that I've seen the book is pretty good

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,940
there's also a workbook version version

00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,980
which cost more that has like fill in

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,800
the blanks and I've had friends do that

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,510
and they love it it's awesome headspace

00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,100
is an app for meditation that helped me

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:42,430
get into meditation a little bit help me

00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:45,220
view inputs as data that kind of thing

00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:47,680
and enjoyable is a web app for social

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,270
anxiety specifically there is no web app

00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,890
for non social anxiety as far as I know

00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:56,020
and I wish there would be one startup

00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:57,790
idea you'll be really helpful you might

00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,160
be thinking why doesn't everyone I know

00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:03,940
already do CBT if it's so amazing I

00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:05,590
think I know why it does take time and

00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,180
energy and effort but mostly people just

00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,280
don't know about it and you all are

00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,350
privileged to know about this phenomenon

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:17,230
now congratulations I hope you use this

00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:21,880
not wisely some of you are thinking I

00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:23,410
have a co-worker who needs this how can

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,170
I get them to do it so the answer is you

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,910
can't but you can influence them

00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,530
slightly to do it you can model the

00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,420
behavior you can do it yourself and

00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:32,800
share how it's affecting you that kind

00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,750
of thing but you can't make someone else

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,950
do this that is probably just gonna make

00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,950
them frustrated with you don't do that

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,830
oh I just gave you a summary I'm very

00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,750
proud I made this image - yep we talked

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:50,289
about this

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:53,520
Bam Bam Bam that's part a I'm gonna take

00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:53,520
some water one second

00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:13,479
good timing I just got the halfway mark

00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:15,009
Oh psychological safety um if you've

00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:17,619
heard this term raise your hand for me I

00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:20,859
want to get a gauge cool this looks like

00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:23,499
a third of the room it's not safe space

00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:25,179
but I'll define that real quick a safe

00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:26,379
space is one where any home to feel safe

00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:28,690
in the group with respect to their

00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:29,830
identity like I'm a queer man and if I'm

00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,570
in a space where they don't accept queer

00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:35,190
people that would not be a safe space in

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:37,450
general specifically for me a

00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,219
psychologically safe group is any group

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,559
where the current members feel safe so

00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:43,509
if it's a group of 5 bigots who would

00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,279
hate me but they get along really well

00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:48,099
together they might be a very productive

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,869
group in some way so it's a lower bar

00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:50,919
psychological safety is a lower bar I

00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:52,539
think we could shoot shoot for the

00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:55,929
higher one but I'm gonna just talk about

00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:59,579
this lower one today so psychological

00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:05,109
safety says that the group is safe for

00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:06,399
interpersonal risk-taking Amy had been

00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:08,409
since one of the original researchers on

00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:09,700
this this was her quote she has a lot of

00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:11,729
content on this if you want to look her

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,729
up

00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,419
I discovered this through an article

00:24:13,779 --> 00:24:17,469
written by some people at Google Google

00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:22,029
did research into what makes teams

00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:24,129
effective it is not personality types or

00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:25,359
skills or background or the management

00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,529
style it's none of those things that

00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,729
they thought might have been it and they

00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:29,169
proved that pretty quickly and when they

00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:30,070
were studying this they were they were

00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:32,950
just trying to see what's the secret

00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,389
sauce that makes the team good it wasn't

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,619
until later when they found a madman

00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:38,549
syns research and tried to see if that

00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:42,309
applied that it did psychological safety

00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:44,589
they noticed that its group norms did do

00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:46,389
the thing a group norm as a set of

00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:48,070
implicit or explicit rules that the

00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:49,299
group follows that defines how you

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,909
interact with other people and all that

00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:53,679
and group norms that follow us like

00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:56,829
safety guidelines guidelines or it just

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,239
happen to be psych safe are really the

00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:01,329
ones that have this like safety that are

00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:03,219
more effective in Google in Amy

00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:04,839
Edmondson s research there were these

00:25:03,219 --> 00:25:06,009
two measures you know you're doing

00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:07,479
research with the measure things on

00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:10,089
scales and all that get data and get

00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:12,099
hard evidence one was conversational

00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:13,389
turn-taking which was how often each

00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:14,979
member in the group got to speak if one

00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:17,950
person was quiet the entire time that

00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:19,780
was a lower point on this scale

00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,460
the other one is average social

00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,740
sensitivity which I think in the study

00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,050
they did with a reading the mine through

00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,880
the eyes test they showed a series of

00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:30,160
photos of people's eyes and you just say

00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,300
or develop angry excited happy and if

00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,860
you're good at that you are more

00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,970
emotionally sensitive to those kinds of

00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,170
cues and if you're not as good you're

00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,260
not as emotionally sensitive and if you

00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:40,720
rather hire your group was probably more

00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,550
successful I want to simplify these two

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,940
measures into broader categories as less

00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:47,620
scientific but more memorable it's

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,940
communication on empathy so team that

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,790
has high communication at high empathy

00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:54,100
is gonna have higher psyche safety if

00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:55,630
the group has higher psyche safety it's

00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,520
safer interpersonal risk-taking you

00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:02,230
could say that the group has a higher

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:04,210
collective IQ said another way if all

00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,890
six members of the team get their voices

00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,180
heard all the time that's smarter than

00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,770
if there's only five people on the team

00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,030
getting their voices heard if one person

00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,200
shut down they're not contributing as

00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:13,630
much so we want to have everybody

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,590
contribute their thoughts to the

00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:20,370
situation all right so we're on the same

00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:24,190
page we want psych safety on the team

00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,640
I'm gonna give you ten techniques in ten

00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:30,040
minutes

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:35,260
Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam you ready yes good

00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:37,750
here are the ten communication first my

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,160
favorite term is my favorite like thing

00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,560
to define for you today the Earned

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,760
dogmatism effect I bet you work with

00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,830
someone who has this this is when

00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,050
somebody has a lot of experience and

00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,880
they are so sure that their way of doing

00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,110
the thing is the right way the best way

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,200
that they don't even wanna hear the

00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:55,300
other ways nope kind of close-minded in

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,210
some cases dogmatism like that is useful

00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,740
i'm dogmatic about basic math 2+2 don't

00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:01,690
tell me it's not four I know it's four

00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,950
you can't change my mind nope but when

00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:06,520
it comes to complex things like a

00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,840
codebase that's very complex it's

00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,190
important to have a more open mind and

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,620
see other perspectives cuz you might be

00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:13,060
missing information so the antidote to

00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,770
the aren't dogmatism effect if there is

00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,990
one it's not a complete one it's to

00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,490
remind the person who's doing this they

00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:20,410
don't have all the information they're

00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:23,320
missing some information would you like

00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,550
that information and often they would if

00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,620
they if they believe they're missing it

00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:30,300
they will open their mind maybe that's

00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,300
the best I've had for that situation

00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:37,830
number two declare unknowns I see teams

00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,660
do this often during a planning meeting

00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,950
where you say okay what are the risks

00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,110
for this project what things do we not

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,970
know yet and I see teams often not do it

00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,260
after the planning meeting so if you

00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,970
model this if you do this more often you

00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,280
declare things you don't know all the

00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,750
time you're gonna be on the same page

00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,220
and you might have to investigate those

00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,990
to reduce risk and that would be great

00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,360
so doing this more often increases

00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,820
communication if you don't declare

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,110
unknowns in general when you realize you

00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,200
don't know something you might be

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,220
hesitant to share that with the team and

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,230
that's an example of where it's like

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:12,330
safety is you don't have it and it's

00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:13,470
hurting your team performance framing we

00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,330
talked about framing a little bit before

00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:17,910
when I told you that I like to be

00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:19,260
excited when I'm uncertain when

00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:23,100
something goes wrong at work like maybe

00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:25,560
you did a deploy and it broke the server

00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,600
and everything went down for users

00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,220
that's awful you could frame it as bad

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,920
wrong about I should feel bad I feel

00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,450
awful I'm awful and I don't know like

00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,230
ruminate you could feel awful or you

00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,760
could try to frame it as a learning

00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,620
experience and say oh our deployment

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,330
infrastructure is brittle why didn't see

00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,460
I run before I deployed let's fix that

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,420
like that kind of thing and as a team if

00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,860
you frame things as learning

00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,150
opportunities more often people are more

00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,640
likely to bring up mistakes they made

00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:54,360
and everyone can learn from them that's

00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:56,040
awesome we all make mistakes and if you

00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,600
acknowledge it publicly more often that

00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:00,600
makes more people able to communicate

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,730
this kind of thing more often so I like

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,890
to tell people I make mistakes I don't

00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,210
know things and I know so please tell me

00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,280
if you find out something I don't know I

00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,590
really am interested in knowing what I

00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,780
don't know knowing what mistakes I make

00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:14,340
for new people you will benefit from

00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,650
doing this on a team if you're a more

00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,060
junior developer I think junior people

00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,380
do this a little more than senior people

00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:24,680
if you do this that's that's a good

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,680
model for the whole team that's powerful

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:30,510
you can also model curiosity anything

00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,280
another team members working on and you

00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,390
don't understand it completely if you

00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,970
ask questions and you want to know a

00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,440
little more about it that might spark

00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:39,450
some ideas that they didn't think of on

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,680
their own and then you know bus factor

00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,680
reduction that's useful to all that

00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,250
modeling curiosity yourself can

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,380
influence the team to also model your

00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:51,000
doom or curiosity question questioning

00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,110
all the time the more you do it the more

00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,220
it affects the team so all of these

00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,020
things if you want your teammates to do

00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:59,300
it you can start by you doing it more

00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,300
more publicly more actively more purpose

00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:05,840
those were five about communication next

00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,320
up we're talking empathy

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,720
propinquity is my other favorite term

00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,160
propinquity is a social science term for

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,050
closeness social closeness it's

00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,450
different than physical closeness so for

00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,890
example I have a neighbor at the

00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,870
apartment next to mine and I've never

00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,100
seen them at another face I see stuff

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,690
outside their door they have like water

00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,490
drugs maybe it's a home office I don't

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:29,010
know what's going on I have do not have

00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,720
hyper penguiny this person technically

00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:34,260
we're physically close but socially

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,550
we're not close at all but the person I

00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,050
lunch with at work all the time we have

00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,790
very high propinquity we're always

00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:40,740
interacting naturally like cross paths

00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,360
we see each other

00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,410
it's important to have propinquity with

00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,300
your teammates so if you're a remote

00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,860
distributed team you probably have

00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,480
generally lower for bring woody than if

00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:51,570
you're in the office that's why I like

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,160
channels like hashtag fluffy chat that's

00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,530
where we post fluffy animals at my last

00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,000
company so stuff like that to just like

00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:01,110
have more natural interaction with

00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,640
teammates that's powerful like regular

00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,890
one-on-ones video chat online can also

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,420
help with that that's more like you see

00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:10,740
them in the hallway but you schedule it

00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:12,090
but it's fine that's fine accounts all

00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,080
right this is such a good word I wanna

00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,090
give you a mnemonic to remember it

00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,090
remember that TV show with the two rats

00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:20,310
that tried to take over the world

00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:24,330
propinquity and the brain fro pink woody

00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:27,590
and the brain now it's gonna stuck in

00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:27,590
your head sorry but you learned a word

00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:31,560
next topic

00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,300
every time you communicate to someone

00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,980
else you communicate on two channels

00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,990
there's a task channel and a

00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,580
relationship channel if you think you're

00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,820
only communicating on the task channel

00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,600
saying fact fact fact fact fact I mean

00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,400
that's all you're explicitly

00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,600
communicating on true but there's an

00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,530
implicit relationship channel that's

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:52,260
also going if it's implicit the other

00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:54,660
person might have to infer what the

00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,040
content of that channel is and we know

00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,940
people are generally it's going to be

00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,620
negative

00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,050
it's uncertain so I would encourage you

00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,820
to explicitly communicate on the

00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,080
relationship channel as well whenever

00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,460
there is uncertainty if you have high

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,050
trust with someone maybe you don't need

00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,460
to do it you're on the same page your

00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,720
close friend you don't got a cushion

00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,430
everything you say with them probably

00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,780
but a teammate or in a high-risk

00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,870
situation you probably want to

00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,640
communicate explicitly so here's an

00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:19,170
acronym pearls you can see I grayed out

00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,240
a lot I'm gonna give you one example the

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:24,360
rest is homework the first one P

00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,860
partnership if you set a statement like

00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,100
I really want to work on this with you

00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,870
I'm excited to do this with you that's

00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:33,120
saying explicitly that the relationship

00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:36,330
between us is good positive I want it

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,620
like the ambiguity on the relation of

00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,090
channel is gone if you say something

00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,120
like that and there's a lot of other

00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:47,550
categories empathy acknowledgement

00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:50,400
respect legitimation and support you can

00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:51,990
find this bullet point in an article

00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:58,370
that I linked to in the notes more

00:32:51,990 --> 00:33:00,930
homework next concept is validation I

00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:03,240
bet half of you I think you know what

00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,010
this means but it's a little bit off at

00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,740
this definition here with the bold word

00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:10,740
understandable this is pretty important

00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:16,500
you can validate someone even if you

00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:17,970
completely disagree with them it's the

00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,380
recognition that another person's

00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:21,360
thoughts feelings behaviors are

00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,710
understandable given their context given

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,390
what they know given their background

00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,400
and experience given given given given

00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:28,770
given of course you would think that and

00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,690
if you can validate someone that helps

00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:33,450
put down their defenses they can open up

00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:34,620
they'll talk more they it's it's

00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:37,620
powerful to do with like friends and

00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,600
co-workers if you want to do a good job

00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:42,600
of it there's a whole framework for it

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,240
by Marsha Linehan who made DBT which is

00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,230
like CBT + validation with concrete

00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,090
validation techniques

00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,620
here's her scale of six layers of

00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,600
validation that therapists do their

00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,310
clients and I do with my friends anyway

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,200
this happens you already do all these

00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:56,790
whether you have the scale on the words

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,940
for it but knowing the scale is pretty

00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:01,260
useful because sometimes I'm sometimes

00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,700
I'll forget to validate and I don't be

00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,740
like overwrite which one could I do oh

00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,910
yeah that one got it or sometimes I'll

00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,070
do a low level one but I could do a

00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,510
little higher I'm not gonna teach you

00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,110
all six of these although I wish I could

00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:13,200
does not

00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:16,920
but I'll tell you maybe the difference

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,810
between four and five four is your

00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,220
friend is afraid of a dog because they

00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,450
were bit as a child so you're walking

00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,190
down the street my dog goes by and they

00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,630
get afraid you're like oh I know why

00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,010
you're afraid I get it it's okay that

00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:28,050
makes sense that you would be afraid of

00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:30,210
a dog because of your back yeah like

00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:34,770
saying that acknowledging it even

00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:36,090
implicitly that's validating number five

00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:38,130
might be if your friend is afraid of a

00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,510
spider because humans in general are

00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:41,250
biologically hardwired to be afraid of

00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,570
spiders and saying that is more powerful

00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,470
than saying yeah you were bit by a

00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:45,990
spider when you were little

00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:47,340
no anyone would be afraid of a spider or

00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:51,030
snake if you want to choose the snake

00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:52,770
that's more generally scary so that's

00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,910
that's two that I was surprised that the

00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:55,890
general was more powerful than the

00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:57,480
specific and maybe own context it would

00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,830
be the other way maybe but just knowing

00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,280
that these are options I think is

00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:04,320
powerful the very lowest level is just

00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,810
being present with someone so if your

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,890
grandfather just passed away your your

00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,970
friend's grandfather and you just sit

00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,890
with them while they're sad that's

00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:12,540
that's validating your presence is

00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:14,310
validating already but if your

00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,990
grandfather passed away recently - and

00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,950
you can really deeply relate to it and

00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,450
you know and you can connect in that

00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,130
level that would be 6 radical

00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,440
genuineness the strong this validation

00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,880
you can do I want to give you more

00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,370
examples for all these this is I could

00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,460
do a whole talk on this but we have to

00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:32,700
keep moving

00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:35,760
next up this one's a little divisive I

00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,320
like to deep personalize ideas if I have

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,490
an idea and it's good and it ends up

00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,780
turning out very well I don't mind

00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,510
having a credit that's all very good I

00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,830
like it but if I'm not sure how it's

00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,450
gonna turn out and I offer an idea to

00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,290
the table I don't really want my name

00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,060
attached to this thing I'm just

00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:50,370
brainstorming I'd rather say idea a

00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,630
don't put my name on it and people

00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,310
usually give me some resistance because

00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,390
it's the easiest it's so quick you know

00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:57,360
Casey said it so you're gonna say

00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:58,740
Casey's idea but I getting my name off

00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,290
of it can make an easier conversation

00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,610
I'm more or less biased toward like

00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,590
choosing based on the person who said

00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:07,500
all that I like to do personalized ideas

00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:13,350
when I can and then after the fact if it

00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:15,540
turns out well you can give credit my

00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:17,580
last one here is vulnerability if you

00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,040
can be vulnerable with your friends

00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:23,040
family coworkers that builds more deep

00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,940
trust if you can share things that are

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,710
sensitive and they give

00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,330
validated you could know you can trust

00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,650
them more and you don't have to be so

00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,960
explicit in the relationship channel and

00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:33,240
all that this is powerful and deep there

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,610
are some talks by brené Brown you might

00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,510
have seen on YouTube I link to those

00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:38,820
there's a really good if she has a book

00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:42,270
or two so totally recommend it I'm not

00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:45,270
gonna go any deeper today so you just

00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:46,860
learned these ten things you might want

00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,240
to revisit this eventually which is why

00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,040
I made the article online for you

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,900
because you're only gonna be able to

00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,980
apply one or two of these at a time I

00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:59,880
bet that's how people generally are a

00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:01,740
lot to work on all right outro this is

00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,000
what that website looks like that I keep

00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,110
telling you about it's a Google Doc that

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,550
I published online where I just put

00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:07,770
links is the easiest thing for me to

00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:10,850
edit I'm a web developer short but I

00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,850
like easy

00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,070
I'd like you to bookmark that that I

00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,570
just showed you

00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,550
I'd like you to print there's a few in

00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,170
purple no how do I go back back back

00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:20,340
back

00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,900
says print save this print save this

00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,790
those I think are the most useful if you

00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,960
want to print it physically or save it

00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,950
your desktop something have it handy

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,810
that's highest recommended otherwise I

00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,190
think you would benefit a lot if you

00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,660
strategize how and when you're gonna go

00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:36,270
through the articles so for me it might

00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,440
be like every Monday at 9:30 after my

00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,060
stand-up I'm gonna go read one article

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,110
short something or maybe I put them in

00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,970
pocket and I'll read on the Metro

00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,600
something but if you think this is

00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,730
valuable

00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:48,270
you should strategize how you're gonna

00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:49,800
get it done I told you about the video

00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,450
if you want your company to learn this

00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,040
I've given this talk this is number 18 I

00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,240
think it's very polished I can do a

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,920
lunch and learn at your company

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,470
especially if you're in the DC area

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,030
because that's where I live if you pay

00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:04,050
for me to fly out maybe a little talk

00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:05,250
sure I can also do a half-day workshop

00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,450
with the team where we can brainstorm

00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,820
and go through and do validation

00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:11,190
exercises and all that it's really

00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:14,220
powerful I've done that at Heroku a

00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:16,290
couple times I'm also working on the

00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:18,150
book format for debugging your brain and

00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,530
half the book is both written and edited

00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:22,050
like I told you and that's on my website

00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,280
you can already read it for free it's

00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,340
when it's done I'm gonna self publish on

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,320
Amazon maybe maybe eventually a real

00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:30,240
publisher too but I don't see that much

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,250
value in it if it gets spread anyway

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,020
Amazon self-publishing is easy if it

00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,020
hits such a small cut I'm excited for it

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:57,329
yeah any questions sorry can you say it

00:38:50,040 --> 00:39:00,480
louder deep personally I D personalizing

00:38:57,329 --> 00:39:03,690
ideas can conflict with validation I can

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,630
imagine it could I can't think of an

00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:08,460
example I think you're right you can't

00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,480
what if you got good at both of these

00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,160
you would know when to use which

00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,829
technique you can't always but I don't

00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,970
think you need to invalidate 2d

00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:16,770
personalize an idea either

00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,869
you can say that's an idea great idea

00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:21,890
but let's reduce our biases but it like

00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:26,930
that's validating while D personalizing

00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:26,930
yeah questions yeah

00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:38,589
I'm so glad you asked the validation

00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:40,390
part is so tricky all those labels are

00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:42,250
they kind of suck they're inaccurate but

00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:44,400
there's no short thing that's accurate

00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,690
then validation mind-reading means if

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,700
they can't already tell you what they're

00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:51,460
thinking and feeling accurately you can

00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,140
suggest are you thinking X or Y or Z and

00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,150
like brainstorm it's really

00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,559
brainstorming like trying to make a good

00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:59,170
guess at what it is but you have to let

00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,640
them and they have to be comfortable to

00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:02,410
tell you whether you're accurately

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,970
guessing or not and if they're not it's

00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:06,849
not it's not working or invalidating at

00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:07,900
that point if you mind read inaccurately

00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:08,950
and they don't feel comfortable

00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,140
correcting you

00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:14,440
that is invalidating that's the opposite

00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,970
in the 10 maladaptive thought patterns

00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,910
if you think you can mind read other

00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:20,349
people like oh they they hate me that

00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,240
person hates me but you have no like

00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:23,710
evidence they never said it that's when

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,059
that's maladaptive because you are

00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,279
believing something strongly that you

00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:28,720
have no evidence for so really it's

00:40:27,279 --> 00:40:30,760
brainstorming is will be the other one

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:35,410
good question no one's asked that of

00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:41,380
ever I think I can do one more question

00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:45,670
I bet it with my time yeah hi oh good

00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:48,960
I'm ahead of schedule a couple more

00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,960
questions yeah thank you thank you

00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,560
yeah I think you're right

00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:28,460
absolutely I'm so glad you you hit that

00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:31,250
how do i summarize yeah sure I think um

00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,870
if your intent is there that's what

00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:34,400
truly counts if you intend to be

00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:36,380
sensitive and if someone calls you out

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,320
you are receptive and work with it

00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,540
that's the thing you don't have to be

00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:46,340
good at like socializing you just have

00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:48,830
to value it that's how I see it I've

00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:51,020
known some people who don't value it and

00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:51,890
that is trouble hunt some teams I don't

00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:58,840
know how to help those people if they

00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:58,840
don't care probably two more questions

00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,190
yeah

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:13,530
I don't know but that would be

00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:17,540
fascinating I really hope it's in

00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:17,540
progress or that it'll happen soon

00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:36,070
good question so if somebody on the team

00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:39,470
is not contributing they're not

00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:42,530
communicating as much how can you help

00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:45,650
them communicate more I think by helping

00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:47,690
them feel more safe that's that's like

00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,680
the answer okay now how do we do that

00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,480
how do we do that

00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,369
smaller groups are generally safer

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,720
actually I have a whole bonus section

00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,950
it's very related to this I'm excited

00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,910
I'm gonna give you the bonus section

00:42:54,950 --> 00:43:00,260
today yeah so the smaller group might be

00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,089
good so one-on-one with the person to

00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,380
talk to them some that'll help if they

00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:04,970
can build confidence and that what small

00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:08,630
one-on-one group maybe a third person

00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:11,990
fourth person like sometimes giving

00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:13,940
pause so that someone who contributes

00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:16,130
things more slowly that takes more time

00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,570
to collect their words so they can

00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:19,430
contribute it like if you've been to an

00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,630
unconference unconferences tend to do

00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,910
this pretty well the ones I've been to

00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,800
they like make a room for people who

00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:28,550
communicate slower to communicate still

00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,140
I think there's there's a lot more ideas

00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,650
but I think that's that's enough for now

00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,369
properly

00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,369
thanks Don

00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:58,980
yeah sometimes a person just doesn't

00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,910
feel comfortable doing it and it's hard

00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,190
because we're pushing them out of their

00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,810
normal boundaries that they catch it

00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:16,010
right

00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:16,010
no I hold the opposite yeah

00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:32,150
yeah pushing some people yeah

00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,349
pushing some people to do that to

00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:35,089
contribute as much as everyone else

00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:36,740
might be very stressful for them and bad

00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,060
for them as a person as their experience

00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,640
of the team and not even help make them

00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:42,349
contribute actively I think that's true

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,650
in the conversational turn taking

00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:46,820
measure it it's a little bit inaccurate

00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:48,589
of a term again because we're like

00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:50,329
generalizing high-level here but it

00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:51,920
counts over the course of the day I

00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:53,810
think if it's in one-on-one meetings

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,119
that's fine it doesn't have to be in

00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:57,200
every active All Hands a lot of people

00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:58,579
meeting that you everybody contributes

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,410
that's not the measure the measure is

00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:02,869
that you do it at some point eventually

00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:05,030
and I think a team member in this case

00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:06,530
would of in some smaller or safer

00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:09,380
situation be able to do it now would be

00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:15,530
great that's working with them - thank

00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:22,329
you all right you ready for my bonus

00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:25,310
slides yeah we're done oh but we're not

00:45:22,329 --> 00:45:29,359
this is a hypothesis I'm working on if I

00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:32,240
went to study a ph.d program I would

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,490
study the social battery phenomenon this

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,140
is totally I'm making this up here if

00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:37,010
it's metaphor seems relevant to you and

00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:40,250
you can apply it to yourself and it

00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:44,329
helps great if not fine short there's no

00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:48,290
study behind this yet yeah thank you

00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:51,680
uh-huh yet I may yet do it a downward

00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:52,790
spiral event probably really drains your

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,290
social battery you don't feel like

00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:56,930
peopling after you're in such a bad

00:45:54,290 --> 00:46:00,069
state so that's one way you can feel

00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:02,089
your social battery charge depleted I

00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:03,410
should reorder these slides but they're

00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:04,970
bonus you see they're not very polished

00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:06,500
as much as the others okay the goal is

00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:08,089
here when talking about social batteries

00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,160
to understand yourself so you can manage

00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:11,780
your own social battery resource and

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,550
understand other people so you can

00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:19,910
understand like validate work with your

00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:21,800
friends co-workers etc so here's a

00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:23,150
dichotomy that's very common extrovert

00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,190
or introvert people like to say an

00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,410
extrovert gains energy from being around

00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,490
people and an introvert loses energy by

00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:33,380
being around people that's a social

00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:35,000
battery this isn't the most accurate

00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,770
definition

00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,270
to me because if you have someone

00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:40,250
isolated forever an introvert who's

00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:42,080
isolated for years they won't be happy

00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:45,230
either they need some social interaction

00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:47,810
and and even an extrovert if they people

00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:48,620
all the time they're gonna get people

00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:50,630
out eventually

00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,970
probably or if they're in a book a bad

00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:55,400
situation peopling something something

00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:57,710
could drain their battery so the battery

00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,540
I think is slightly different than just

00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:01,430
extrovert introvert all right let's talk

00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,830
about what can drain people's batteries

00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:05,960
in both both categories if there's a lot

00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:08,090
of people around I think your battery is

00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,140
more likely to drink faster if there are

00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:10,880
less familiar people through all

00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:13,280
strangers you're more likely to drain

00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,500
and if it's a high-risk interaction like

00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,060
if you're being interviewed and they

00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:21,110
already seem like they don't like you

00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:23,000
that's pretty draining I think most

00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:25,130
people charge slowly by being alone

00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,080
introverts focus on this more introverts

00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:29,480
need downtime Shore yup extroverts I

00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,370
think also is charged slowly by being

00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:37,340
alone some amount just not as fast as

00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:39,080
the ideal X or situation I think both

00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,430
types of people charge faster when

00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,390
there's fewer people around like an

00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:45,230
extrovert with their best friend

00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:46,940
probably is still charging an introvert

00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:49,040
around a few people is maybe more

00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,750
charging yeah this is like the opposite

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,430
so if there's um if you're in a

00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:54,230
one-on-one with your best friend and

00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:56,660
it's low-risk just hanging out that

00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:58,370
might charge you the most interesting

00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,360
thing I discovered when talking to

00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:06,950
friends about this like interviewing

00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:08,210
doing what's the word not data anecdotal

00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,830
research thank you yeah I was doing

00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:11,810
anecdotal research on friends a lot and

00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:13,670
there's a whole category of people who

00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:16,490
have never felt their social battery

00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:18,500
charged by any other human except maybe

00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:19,760
I got a few of these little edge case

00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,200
stories when they were had their

00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,610
childhood best friend they charged them

00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,840
but since now they're an adult they

00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,610
don't have anyone to charge them and I

00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,870
just think that's fascinating so maybe

00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:29,570
they didn't have such a close intimate

00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:31,070
safe psychologically safe relationship

00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,540
with anyone in this adult life now and

00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:33,590
that would make them more introverted of

00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:35,660
course they want more alone time to

00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:39,020
charge they can't charge from the other

00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:40,370
people all right so there are two ideas

00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,840
at play here the battery which I think

00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:43,520
we've covered pretty well you got it and

00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,320
then the other one is social

00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,420
satisfaction is what I would label it if

00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,530
I did this research so your battery can

00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,930
charge or deplete based on all these

00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:50,549
fact

00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:51,720
but you need a certain amount of social

00:48:50,549 --> 00:48:54,779
satisfaction to be happy if you're

00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:58,499
isolated you won't be introverts need

00:48:54,779 --> 00:49:00,660
some people time - all right so battery

00:48:58,499 --> 00:49:02,309
I like that the analogy of a battery

00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,720
because it can like charge and drain and

00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:07,349
it's powering something what's it

00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:09,329
powering I think it's probably powering

00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:15,839
a mental simulation you have the people

00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:18,329
around you so if that's true then like

00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,499
that's what we drain it is modeling more

00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:21,539
people who are you're you're less

00:49:19,499 --> 00:49:21,749
familiar with it kind of makes sense to

00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:24,269
me

00:49:21,749 --> 00:49:28,200
I would love to research and see if this

00:49:24,269 --> 00:49:34,380
is true that's it for my bonus material

00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:36,509
any question on that part all right

00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:38,690
I bet you were ready for lunch after

00:49:36,509 --> 00:49:40,890
someone else speaks up here I bet I

00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,620
can't wait to eat you thanks for having

00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:48,880
me

00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:48,880
