Title: Chad Granum - "Better Testing with Test2-Suite"
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	Test2 rewrote the internals of Test::Builder effecting nearly every testing tool on CPAN. The Test2 ecosystem and internals are significantly improved over what used to be available. This talk provides an introduction to the new internals, a new suite of tools built on top of those internals, and also gives an overview on how to convert existing tests. This talk changes a little bit every year as things further improve, and also based on feedback from previous years. This talk is a great opportunity for people to stay informed about modern testing in perl.
