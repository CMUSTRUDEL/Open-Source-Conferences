Title: Emily Shea - "Perl Out Loud"
Publication date: 2019-06-18
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	As a Senior Software Engineer at Fastly, I use voice dictation as my main form of interacting with the computer. I will talk about my experience with Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) and how this led me to discover voice dictation and subsequently change my perception of the viability of using voice dictation for software development. I will cover some unique challenges to using voice dictation, from homophones and defining custom vocabulary, to designing and building my own voice commands to write Perl. This talk is relevant to anyone who might find themselves unable to use a keyboard or mouse, anyone curious about exploring new ways of interacting with a computer, anyone writing software for people using different input methods, and anyone interested in learning what it's like writing Perl by voice in 2019. It's important to make known that voice dictation is a viable option for those who can benefit from it, and as more people are using voice assistants to interact with their phones and computers, we should be thinking about using voice for software development.

good morning this is my first time at

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,460
the pearl conference and this is also my

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:17,190
first ever public conference talk so on

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:19,650
the side of the year I'm excited to

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,949
share with you all my adventures of

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:27,539
talking to computers and talking pearl

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:29,310
out loud so next slide Who am I so my

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,830
name is Emily you can find me on github

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,329
as touche or on twitter as you O'Malley

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,850
I write code for fastly next slide

00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:40,649
fastly at fastly we help developers make

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,260
fast secure and reliable digital

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,239
experiences happen by processing and

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,039
serving customers applications at the

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,640
edge and as close to end-users as

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,770
possible

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,570
we built an edge cloud platform designed

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,879
to be programmable and support agile

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,920
software development we have 60 points

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,579
of presence around the world as of March

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,129
31st 2019 and I work on the platform for

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,330
delivering the core CDN configurations

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:09,570
at fastly and next slide I write Perl by

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,840
voice next slide your first question

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,729
might be but why why why why would you

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,170
want to do that that sounds kind of

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:22,020
insane and it sort of is next slide

00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:25,590
because I am an unfortunate soul who

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,720
ended up with RSI symptoms in the fall

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,090
of 2017 I started having problems in

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,159
both of my arms if you're not familiar

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,869
with RSI its pain felt and your muscles

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,509
nerves and tendons caused by repetitive

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:38,100
motion and overuse so in our industry it

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,770
often comes from using a keyboard mouse

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,450
these things too much so it

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,320
significantly impaired my ability to

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,820
type in both of my arms next slide

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,560
before getting to voice I tried taking

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,020
breaks I tried wearing the wrist braces

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,579
at night I tried anti-inflammatories I

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,009
went through rounds of occupational and

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,860
physical therapies I did tried massage

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:01,530
next slide next slide

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,049
I tried acupuncture chiropractor pain

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,729
creams yoga stretching all kinds of

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,119
stuff if you can think of it I probably

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,190
tried it next slide I tried

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,400
juergen ah mcc's so I got an Ergo

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,220
evaluation I switched to

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,720
standing desk only I got a left hand

00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,790
Mouse so so I could split the load

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,790
between my right and my left hand I got

00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:27,319
specialty keyboards next slide next

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:29,950
slide I tried a split keyboard I tried

00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:32,689
even more specialty keyboards I ended up

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,340
ultimately with the top left keyboard

00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:36,319
there with the white keys the mitosis to

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,569
help offload work for my pinkies to my

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,120
thumbs and with all these modifications

00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:44,120
it did get me quite far but it was still

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,139
feeling very limited even with taking 4

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,940
leave a day it's a lot right and then

00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:52,190
move to prescription anti-inflammatories

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,200
and doing all kinds of stretching at a

00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,180
very disciplined way and taking breaks

00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,150
all the time when I'm working I could

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,420
only get about maybe 30 to 45 minutes of

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:05,000
typing in in a given window and over a

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,769
course of a day probably maybe 3 hours

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,689
of typing but it's very broken up and

00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,849
the quality of life well as I'm working

00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:12,079
was pretty poor it was constantly being

00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:13,549
interrupted by your body

00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:15,139
I think everyone's had some annoying

00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:16,790
alert from something that's just pain

00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:18,709
you or someone coming over to your desk

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,090
and hey hey hey right like that's pretty

00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:21,919
annoying imagine your body doing that

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:26,930
while you're working pretty

00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:29,659
uncomfortable next slide so sad face I

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,639
said because I was feeling so limited I

00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:33,739
started looking into alternative ways

00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,159
that would not involve my hands next

00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:37,280
slide

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,930
can I use my voice can I use my voice

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,000
instead and remove the keyboard mouse

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,359
entirely Birnam I don't care figure out

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,970
you know can I just like get rid of it

00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:48,680
and even at that point in time even if

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,379
what I found with voice was super clunky

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,150
and difficult to use it was still better

00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:55,310
than what I was doing

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,040
probably so let's try it out why not

00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,470
next slide when I first started I was

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,489
expecting writing pearl by voice to go

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:10,040
something like this

00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:14,299

00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:31,460
day oh man that would be rough but but

00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,560
actually when I started looking at voice

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,500
solutions what I found was was much much

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,870
different and so I'm gonna do a short

00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,220
demo for you writing the same code that

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,690
this gentleman was trying to write but

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,550

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,220
case in point this is me working around

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,200
there are not being an accessible like

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,010
video thing that I can use in my talk so

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:28,750
we'll get to that but um yeah so let me

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:28,750
just do this anyway so next slide reload

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:56,020
on okay so let's take a little bit into

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,940
the tech that I'm using to make make all

00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,710
that work so obviously I need a good

00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,589
microphone I'm using a microphone now

00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,150
that hopefully is picking up noise only

00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:06,580
from one direction so it's not picking

00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,260
up a lot of ambient noise I am also

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,490
running dragon dictation so this is a

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,230
software some of you might have heard of

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,600
before it's used across a lot of

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,010
industries you use it to dictate

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,630
documents email as that sort of thing

00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:19,540
but it hasn't been widely used to write

00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:22,060
code or write even you know especially

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,589
Perl the technology that I'm really

00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:28,650
excited to tell you all about today is

00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:32,410
Talon so Talon next slide Talon is a

00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:34,390
software for hands-free input where you

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,520
can use voice commands noise

00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,110
it also has ight racking support so you

00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,930
can get off your keyboard but still

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,760
control your your computer it uses the

00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,920
dragon dictation API so it sort of runs

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,240
on top of dragon and uses dragons voice

00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,670
engine although it does have its own

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,050
free built-in voice engine but it's not

00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:53,740
quite at parity yet so I still use

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:55,390
dragon you can the the exciting part is

00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,150
that you can programmatically configure

00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:00,070
all your toolset using Python so all the

00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:04,140
things I'm going to demo for you today

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:06,580
are built in Python files on my laptop

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,370
they're not telling itself so I can

00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:12,040
customize this thing like crazy the

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,750
software talent is free and there is

00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,060
patreon support if you are a kind soul

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:21,010
that wants to help forward the you know

00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:21,640
voice for coding cause so check that out

00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,770
if you're interested

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,630
next slide so let's start at the ABCs

00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,910
when you start learning a new keyboard

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,680
or working by voice you want to start

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,140
with the basic keys so how do I get

00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,660
letters how do I hit the you know letter

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,029
keys you would think that oh I can just

00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,500
say a and I'll get a I'll say B and I'll

00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:44,290
get B but there's a problem with that

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,060
next slide with the way we pronounce the

00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,160
alphabet there are a lot of letters that

00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,089
sound very similar I'm sure everyone in

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,129
here has been on the phone

00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:53,410
when you have to be like Amazon Mike and

00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:55,300
isn't Nancy you know because you don't

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,199
know if the other person's gonna get the

00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:01,480
right letter or not

00:11:56,199 --> 00:12:03,309
so a hjk could all be confused BCDE GP d

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,629
VZ right like that's a lot of letters

00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:06,999
that could really be confused so for

00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:09,870
accuracy purposes we want a different

00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:12,370
way to represent the alphabet next slide

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:14,019
so the phonetic alphabet there's a

00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,079
system already to help differentiate

00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:20,519
between the letters you use a word and

00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:24,189
said so alpha Bravo Bravo Charlie Delta

00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,600
this would give us accuracy but I don't

00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:28,889
think anyone wants to say November over

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,559
and over so we're gonna design our own

00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:35,379
word set for the alphabet next slide

00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:36,939
next slide so this is the alphabet I use

00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,860
and this is all customizable if you

00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:40,360
wanted something you know different you

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,720
could you know make it whatever you want

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,920
but all of these or how I get all the

00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,769
letter keys so I'm going to do a quick

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,579
live demo for you spelling some words so

00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:53,860
you can see how this works

00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:56,790
talent demo pit each red lip space sits

00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:00,459

00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:09,550
delete delete mad on each delete delete

00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:11,050
each next slide okay so what about all

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,600
those symbols and pearl right like I

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:16,059
don't know is that gonna be a problem so

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,589
actually it's not it's these are pretty

00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:19,240
easy this is something I didn't have to

00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,769
spend a whole lot of time solving all

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,839
the symbols are what you think they

00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:25,360
would be so dollar dollar you know

00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,679
outside outside you can customize it to

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,519
be whatever you want so if you want to

00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:31,269
make it hard for yourself you can you

00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:35,499
have the power

00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:39,699
oh right huh but so you know I'll demo

00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:44,730
for you oops sorry oh gosh what is going

00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:44,730
on here sorry that was a mistake okay

00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:53,550
sorry we're back my I'll demo for you

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,709
here are some of the symbols talent demo

00:13:53,550 --> 00:14:01,710
dollar slash equals quote ampersand

00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:05,190
quote pipe quote at sign quote semicolon

00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:07,050
Talon sleep next slide that's actually

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:10,230
some valid pearl that I pulled from a

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:15,210
pearl camel did I generated because the

00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:16,740
a pearl next slide okay so once you know

00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,990
you basic keys your alphabet your

00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,120
modifiers you know control is control

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:23,430
shift is shift or ship if you have

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,899
trouble and print you know you're not

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:27,660
seeing the F T which is kind of a hard

00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,980
sound if you know keyboard shortcuts for

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,450
whatever you using this will get you

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:38,940
quite far talent demo phrase pearl is

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:42,140
awesome command air command cat command

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,270
right enter command best talent sleep

00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,550
next slide

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:50,430
Homa phones okay so this is unique to

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,050
working by voice homophone czar words

00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:55,470
that sound the same but they are spelled

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:57,779
differently so like bite bite or bite

00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,790
there's three different you know which

00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,800
one do i which one am i saying you don't

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,910
know the voice you know system doesn't

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,620
either so we have to have a way to

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,209
disambiguate homophone it's on the fly

00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:11,580
as i'm working so i can get the right

00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:15,150
words so talent demo phrase bite select

00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:18,200
word mmm command air

00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:25,170
yeah command right delete command air

00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:30,839
phones phones bite mmm oh I did a thing

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:32,190
we're on phones bite phones bite showed

00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,520
up here because I changed the focus

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:37,380
sorry alright so talent sleep so you can

00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,550
see like I have a webview that pops up

00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:44,910
and I can pick which version I want

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:47,450
talent demo pic 3 except now I'm not

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,450
focused in there

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:54,220
delete word phones bite pick two there

00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:59,670
you go

00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:06,370
delete word phrase Colonel select word

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:08,080
select commander fonts talent sleep so

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,340
there's like two Houma phones then I can

00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,020
get like an immediate switch which is

00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:16,480
cool so next slide

00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:18,190
Oh last slide last slide so if you want

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,780
to learn more about home phones I have a

00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,240
really great resource for you with a lot

00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:25,600
of good content next slide is a book

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,370
called llama phones and I bought one for

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,550
my nephew and then I thought it was so

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,930
good I bought one for myself so I highly

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,170
recommend you check it out if you really

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:37,600
interested this topic next slide okay so

00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:43,480
repetition if you remember from the

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,440
video at the beginning talent sleep if

00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,830
you remember from the video in the

00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:51,880
beginning the gentleman sank backspace

00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:53,140
backspace backspace right that doesn't

00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,680
take long to get really frustrating

00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:58,630
right we need a better way to repeat

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,520
commands efficiently so that we don't

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:04,810
get frustrated and you know tableflip

00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:06,880
and whatever so I so a lot of people

00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:09,430
who've done voice coding before might

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,230
use like twice thrice just say like

00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:13,540
repeat this so many times but what comes

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,250
after thrice I don't know and I don't

00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,230
want to make up a bunch of words or like

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,120
figure out what comes next I don't know

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,500
maybe there's English words they that

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,709
represent that but I don't know what

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,670
they are so I did a thing that's a

00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,520
little bit happy with the English

00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,690
language where you can get a

00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,270
representation of numbers in a different

00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,370
form that I don't use as much so there's

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,960
ordinals right that I'm not going to use

00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,810
that much so I'm going to use ordinals

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,820
to represent repetition so if I say go

00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:42,670
down fourth it's going to go down four

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,850
times why can't I just use regular

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:48,520
numbers why can't I say delete four

00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:52,180
because there's no way to tell whether

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,690
you want the number four and then or

00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,460
sorry

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,900
delete four so delete and then the

00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,320
number four or if you want to delete

00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:09,840
four times it's hard to disambiguate so

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:16,540
yeah telling demo talent demo reload

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,450
okay formatting so what if I want to

00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,280
format my text I don't want just like

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:36,880
you know I need to like uppercase any

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,890
camelcase and you whatever so I have a

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,290
bunch of tools written in Python that

00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:43,360
will format the text as I want I can

00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,740
give it commands ahead of the text and

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,750
it'll sort of do what I want so I'll

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,510
done that right now

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:53,680

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,400
okay so custom vocabulary what if I run

00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,650
into a word that my voice engine doesn't

00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,820
know about already I need you know but

00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,750
maybe it's all over my codebase and I

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,080
don't want to spell it out every time

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,370
because I get annoying if so there's

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,520
actually support for me to add custom

00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:29,800
vocabulary if I if the engine can guess

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,870
well enough the pronunciation of it I

00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,970
can just add it to the vocabulary and

00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,080
it'll just sort of work so I'll demo for

00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,670
you a few words I've added to my

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,300

00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:43,530

00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,730

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:34,480
do I work in the browser the browser I

00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:36,909
use a plugin called Vimeo which allows

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,240
me to navigate browsers just like sort

00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:43,270
of like you would with them so if I hit

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,640
the F key or far in my setup then I get

00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,529
all these like hints as to where all the

00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,850
links are and then from there I can just

00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:51,880
tell it you know if I want to click on

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:53,620
my handle far-far it'll hit touche there

00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,830
or you know so that's how i navigate

00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:59,110
around using using the browser github is

00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,760
very good about being accessible by the

00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:03,480

slide okay

00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,279
so now that you get a sense of the flow

00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,019
I'm going to talk a little bit about the

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:38,350
challenges that I've encountered using

00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:40,700
voice next slide next slide one is the

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,620
learning curve so the learning curve can

00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,909
be a bit steep if you think about if you

00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,320
get a new keyboard you try one of these

00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:47,659
like crazy customized keyboards the

00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,610
learning curve is pretty steep so take

00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:51,289
that but imagine now you're using a

00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:52,820
different part of your body you're now

00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:55,429
hearing sounds you weren't you're used

00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,409
to hearing so you might not be able to

00:27:55,429 --> 00:28:01,220
as quickly think while you're working

00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:02,690
because now you're hearing stuff and so

00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,129
I can be difficult also if you're trying

00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,450
to learn this while you have an injury

00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:07,250
that can be a bit difficult because

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,570
you're trying to learn a thing so you

00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,950
don't have to type but you have to type

00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:11,809
to be able to learn the thing it's kind

00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:15,350
of a chicken and egg difficult

00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:17,600
bootstrapping issue it's still pretty

00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:21,470
new I think in the you know using voice

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,450
to code space and there are some

00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,370
conventions but in general like a lot of

00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,960
people have to build their own tool sets

00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,159
and sort of grab pieces from here and

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,700
there and you have your own bespoke

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:35,139
thing so that can be a little bit more

00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:39,740
of a you know difficult next slide

00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:41,299
okay so tools of poor accessibility so

00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,039
most of the time when I run to a

00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:45,679
roadblock or have a frustration it's not

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,629
talent it's not dragon it's not you know

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,519
something with my tool set it's often I

00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:51,830
encounter in an app that is not built

00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,990
that with accessibility in mind it's a

00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,490
website where there's a button and I

00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,740
can't click it because it's not the

00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,659
actual HTML button and it's not a link

00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,950
and so I can't get to it and that's

00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:02,450
really frustrating makes me really sad

00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,490
because then I have to spend a lot of

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,019
extra time working around the thing or

00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:08,870
finding a new tool and learning how to

00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:10,549
new use a new tool so this is my call

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,870
for all for all of us developers out

00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:14,000
there to find there's a lot of great

00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:15,950
talks about accessibility you know keep

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,340
yourself you know up in the

00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:20,720
accessibility space and and find some

00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,840
great talks and help build tools that

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,720
you someday might appreciate having

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,000
access to so this is not what this talk

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,960
is about but you know go go find go

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:37,340
forth and find the talks next slide

00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:38,630
nextslide voice strain so what happens

00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,860
if you're talking to your computer now

00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,750
for eight hours a day instead of typing

00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,850
on a keyboard eight hours a day you can

00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,520
put strain on your vocal cords so now

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:47,870
you need to take extra care about taking

00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,430
care of your vocal cords maybe I'm not

00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,220
gonna go screaming all weekend at a rock

00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:54,080
concert or something but I'm you know

00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,720
gonna make sure I'm talking at an even

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,880
tone turns out whispering and talking

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,090
very loudly or more strain on your vocal

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,410
cords I also at home have a humidifier

00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:06,200
and I keep the temperature at a good

00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:09,350
space so I try to you know keep keep a

00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:14,420
good health of my vocal vocal cords next

00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:16,010
slide next slide open offices so I know

00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:19,580
in tech everyone loves to complain about

00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:20,810
open offices I do not have opinions

00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,330
about whether they are good or bad but

00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:27,500
when you add a microphone there are some

00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:28,700
challenges with that so if I am in the

00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,040
middle of an open office and I have a

00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,570
microphone there I might be generating

00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,930
noise that's bizarre to some people to

00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:37,250
hear and also I'm gonna get noise into

00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:39,200
my microphone that might get in the way

00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:44,090
of me working so there's a few solutions

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:46,430
to this next slide next slide one of

00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:51,830
them is this curious contraption called

00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:53,570
a steno mask so yes so they so you put

00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,640
them like around your mouth and it's

00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:58,100
meant to contain you're speaking into

00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,710
the device and then also block any

00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,760
background noise so you if you use one

00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,900
of these hopefully you're not bothering

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,410
your neighbor and they're also not

00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:09,500
bothering your voice engine so yeah yeah

00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:12,500
yeah I mean they do look a little odd

00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,910
you know but um when I was on the plane

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,080
here I was like no I'd be gratified a

00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,550
steno mask right now because then I

00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,140
could like work on my slides and not

00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:20,660
bother like you know these people

00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,770
sitting next to me so they do have a

00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:25,450
purpose and a lot of people find them

00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:28,970
very useful next slide next slide

00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:31,910
acoustic pods so this is a slightly more

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,410
expensive option I did talk to one

00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:35,360
gentleman who does work by voice and his

00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:37,280
company bought him an acoustic pod he

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,050
goes to sit in it you know near his team

00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,490
is a little like glass thing that sort

00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:45,000
of contains the noise which is kind of

00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:46,740
cool next slide or remote work so

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,720
I am lucky to work at a company that's

00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,669
very remote friendly and I get to you

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,919
know be in my house with my humidifier

00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:54,390
and temperature as I as I like and I can

00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,530
like lay on the couch you know because I

00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,390
don't need keyboard and I can lay on the

00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:59,309
couch and talk to my computer or lay on

00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,230
the floor you know or you know deploy

00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:05,850
software from warrior 3 or whatever so

00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:07,049
it's great next slide that's a big

00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,429
challenges so things I thought were

00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:10,590
gonna be challenging but actually

00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:12,120
weren't supporting specific programming

00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,460
languages so there's actually not that

00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,620
much that you need to do like just with

00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,510
the basic keys you can I can go start

00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,039
writing go if I want I can go pick up

00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:23,490
Python you know write Python if I want

00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:24,690
if I want to optimize the experience of

00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,580
writing for that language I can add

00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,350
things that make it easier but in

00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,970
general like there's nothing blocking me

00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:32,190
I don't have to go like write a library

00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,590
just so I can then work and go it'll

00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:36,659
just sort of work I can do some fancy

00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,159
things where if I have voice commands

00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:40,559
for a specific language they're only

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,000
active in when I'm working in a file

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,990
with this file extension or something

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,030
like that so I can have the same

00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,770
commands for Perl but do different

00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,289
things you know and Python and Perl and

00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:53,549
things like that which is cool

00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:56,850
next slide next slide okay voice

00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:58,650
dictation friendly code itself so there

00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,159
wasn't that many things I ran into here

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,929
my voice

00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,090
toolset is pretty flexible and powerful

00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:04,530
so in general like there weren't that

00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,090
many things but there are a few things I

00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,770
thought were worth mentioning and I

00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,120
think are good practice anyway hopefully

00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:12,059
there's nothing too controversial here

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,970
but using abbreviations and acronyms

00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:17,880
thoughtfully so if you don't need to use

00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:20,190
it maybe think twice about it

00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,140
some acronyms and abbreviations great

00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,400
they're they're perfectly fine to use if

00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,360
they're well well-known and you know

00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,150
things like that might make more sense

00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,010
but if you abbreviate things or make an

00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:31,080
acronym when you don't need to not only

00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,669
are you making it harder for future

00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,980
readers of your code they may not know

00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:36,570
what the acronym means and also I have

00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,330
to spell them out every time with the

00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:41,159
letters so that makes me sad so if you

00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:43,650
use the word I can just say phrase the

00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,270
word and that's great this also has a

00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:47,340
benefit to people who use screen readers

00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:50,610
when they hear the code if it's a word

00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,590
it also benefits them so don't try to

00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,030
save on vowels so if you want you're

00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,530
trying to like I'll just remove a few

00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,310
like letters because it's making me like

00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:59,050
slightly more efficient you know

00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:01,270
this would be one size maybe like you

00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:03,580
don't need that optimization because

00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:05,800
it's clearer I can say freeze backspace

00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,250
instead of saying bat crunch son pit cap

00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,899
every time right

00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:13,179
shorter files in general make things

00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:14,950
easier for me so if it's a super long

00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:16,510
file a lot of times I navigate around

00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,100
using the file number so I have a

00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,139
command that's like spring five and

00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,909
it'll jump me to line five and if the

00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:24,399
line number is fifteen thousand one

00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:27,700
hundred and fifty three that gets really

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,990
annoying so shorter files I think are

00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,610
better for me and hopefully just you

00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,470
know good practice anyway to try not to

00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:36,129
make fifteen thousand line files next

00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:38,620
slide okay so the why I want to revisit

00:34:36,129 --> 00:34:40,720
the why of why am I giving this

00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,669
presentation why am I talking to my

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,210
computer why am I here talking to you

00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:47,649
about talking to computers and I would

00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:50,230
be doing a disservice if I didn't

00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:52,990
reiterate the impact that this kind of

00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,810
technology has for people who can

00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:59,200
otherwise not use a keyboard or mouse

00:34:54,810 --> 00:35:01,420
for people like me who I was facing some

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,210
pretty career limiting or potentially

00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:08,460
career-ending injuries I feel you know

00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:10,630
feeling like doors closing and and and

00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:14,200
you know and then town comes along and

00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:19,840
then it really helped save my career I

00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:22,510
think it helped me get quality of life

00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,700
back so if I don't need to type on the

00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,450
keyboard I get I reduce my pain levels I

00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,340
don't need to take any of those

00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:31,570
anti-inflammatories anymore because

00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:34,810
that's an unsustainable situation I no

00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:38,800
longer need to I know I'm no longer

00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:40,840
interrupted as I'm working so I can work

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,030
and I can think about my work I can stop

00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,950
what I want oh my gosh the first day

00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:46,870
when I got to just stop working because

00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:49,060
I wanted to stop working and not because

00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:51,010
it's time for a stretch break or chima

00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:55,360
hands really bothering me like that was

00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:57,390
like a huge relief so I just want to you

00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:02,620
know oh how did we get there last slide

00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:06,220
last slide last slide last slide last

00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:08,530
slide last slide so I just want to

00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:10,920
reiterate the importance of this kind of

00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:16,060
technology next slide

00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:18,790
next slide so the takeaways take care of

00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,619
your body and appreciate what it can do

00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:22,089
for you now it's actually quite an

00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:23,530
amazing instrument and I think we don't

00:36:22,089 --> 00:36:26,500
all spend enough time appreciating what

00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:28,630
it can do people are using speech to

00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,589
code in real life today so there are

00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,790
people out there this is one of the

00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:32,920
things I was surprised about when I

00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,800
started is it people are actually doing

00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,030
this today right now so it's not like

00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,430
this is a thing that may happen in the

00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,930
future it's happening right now remember

00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:43,119
your non keyboard users when you're

00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:45,730
building things because maybe someday

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,500
you will be that user anyway and you

00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,970
don't want to cut off access to someone

00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,119
for using your thing you want people to

00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:54,579
use your things I hope right also so

00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:57,130
this is the most thought leader thing I

00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:59,079
will say to you today the future might

00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,640
actually be more diverse than the

00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:04,329
keyboard mouse model we've been relying

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,250
a lot on touch to control our computers

00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:08,319
and I think we might be right on the

00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:10,270
cusp of some changes to that so you're

00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:12,609
seeing things like voice assistance

00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:14,200
becoming more popular Siri Alexa you're

00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:16,540
seeing things like Apple announcing that

00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,920
they're expanding support for voice

00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,670
control on all their devices

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,810
there's even companies that are using

00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,880
neural signals so there has like a

00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:26,560
wearable device that will interpret your

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,560
neural signals and allow you to and to

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,810
control your computer so even for people

00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,640
without injuries we might be looking at

00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:35,170
a future where we have a more diverse

00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,220
model you're not just relying on

00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:41,190
keyboard and mouse all the time so I

00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,990
think it's very interesting next slide

00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:48,660
thank you for coming to my talk next

00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:53,460
slide next slide next slide

00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:57,310
by the way fastly is hiring next slide

00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:59,920
next slide here's some useful links for

00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:02,920
you so the Tallinn website my Tallinn

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,630
all my tools on Tallinn are on github in

00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,089
public so there's also a tile and

00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:08,290
community repo where you can if you want

00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:10,180
to get started that's generally where we

00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:11,440
point people at and then the talent

00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,500
patreon again if you want to support

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,819
technology like this next slide if you

00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:20,040
have questions I'm here for questions

00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:27,210
yes

00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:34,890
I haven't yet made it to the opera

00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:36,950
singer forums yeah I've been digging

00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:40,020
down deep to my like high school choir

00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:42,540
experience um see if maybe some of those

00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,710
exercise would be good another I don't

00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,260
know this is like tangentially related

00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:48,360
but I have some of us have started

00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:51,090
watching like beatboxing videos because

00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,920
some of the sounds we can actually build

00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,870
into the voice thing and have them

00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,240
recognized so so the people who use I

00:38:54,870 --> 00:39:03,150
trackers for the clicking they'll use

00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:05,280
like a pop noise and so yeah yeah yeah

00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,870
yeah and a lot of the noises are

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,300
actually easier to make and less strain

00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:11,730
on your vocal chords than words so

00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,920
there's a there's also a some research

00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:18,560
going on with the Talon author to

00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:26,250
support more noises yeah more questions

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:30,090
I you know that was that was a a threat

00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:37,670
model I considered no one has done that

00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:37,670
yet please don't but yeah

00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:53,960
I have not tried on purl 6 yet yeah but

00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,130
I imagine it wouldn't be like because I

00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:07,130
don't find that much difference between

00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:08,420
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I wouldn't

00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,880
expect it to to be that much different

00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:13,060
in terms of like having to produce it

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,060
yeah

00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:38,340
right I just realized I'm not repeating

00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,750
the question so I repeat this one it was

00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,280
a question about the community whether

00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,760
we're sharing standards communicating

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,350
with each other

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,780
and how it was that look like right now

00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:48,270
and the answer is yes so there's

00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:50,340
different there's sort of different

00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:53,070
tribes right now of like people using

00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:55,290
different things so Talan isn't like the

00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:56,790
first of these voice systems right

00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:58,980
there's the voice code and there's

00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:00,840
another system that's like caster

00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,000
dragonfly and there's different people

00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,220
using different things right now Alan's

00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,870
Mac only so the Mac only folks tend to

00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,360
go with talent I don't need to set up

00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:10,950
any like extra VM or or do any other

00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,580
crazy stuff with this I literally just

00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:17,160
install it which is nice there are some

00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:19,320
email groups for the Dragonfly caster

00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,200
folks they have an email group and then

00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,580
the Talon group we've got a slack

00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,760
community which is actually pretty

00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:28,170
helpful it's been like so nice to be

00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,240
able to just pop in there and ask

00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,830
questions and like get help with things

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,120
and people posting their scripts or like

00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:43,980
how do you do this and like it's really

00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:46,380
nice it's really cool with your eyes

00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:48,750
yeah so Talon has support for eye

00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,430
trackers I have an eye tracker it's like

00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,780
a device looks like this it's got two

00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:53,070
cameras the sort of falls where your

00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:56,070
eyes are and then the mouse cursor

00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:58,500
follows where your eyes are moving the

00:41:56,070 --> 00:42:01,050
for me like I haven't made use a lot of

00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:03,000
people make use of it I'm maybe one of

00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:04,170
the oddballs that doesn't and part of

00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,150
that is because I kind of like to be

00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:09,360
able to like be in warrior 3 and like

00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:11,760
deployed like just not be standing in

00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,680
front of my computer but they are pretty

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,320
neat one interesting tidbit about them

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,660
is when you first set it up it sometimes

00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,800
feels a bit jittery and like the you

00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,960
know cursor is bouncing around and I

00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,580
found out that it's not actually the

00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,110
technology or the camera or anything

00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,940
that's making a jittery it's your eyes

00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:30,270
it's your eyeballs that are that jittery

00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:32,130
yeah and your brain like just like makes

00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:35,580
it Tunes it out and makes it all seem

00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:39,110
seem sane so huh I thought that was

00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:39,110
interesting yeah

00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,430
right so the question is whether in real

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,440
life I've started just you know spelling

00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:03,809
the alphabet like in my alphabet and the

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,339
answer is yes all the time you know I'll

00:43:03,809 --> 00:43:06,960
be looking at something and instead of

00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:10,369
spelling it I'm like saying the talents

00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,369
stuff we're in it's kind of funny yeah

00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:13,369
yeah

00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:30,000
yeah for sure you can drop in like I do

00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,620
some of this stuff as I'm working I'll

00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,180
iterate I'll you know open my talent

00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:35,550
file and then I want to command that

00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,350
does this and some people have done

00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:39,120
things where you know you hit this key

00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:40,680
and this key and then you you know go

00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,630
right this many times and then you know

00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,930
enter and it'll do the thing for you

00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:47,760
generally like I don't have that many

00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:49,230
for Perl just cuz I haven't like bother

00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,290
to build them but you could you could go

00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:56,450
crazy like you can there's you know

00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:56,450
there's a lot you can do so yeah

00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:26,950
yeah so the question was about I this

00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:29,200
talk was a lot about me adapting but

00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:30,730
what has my team done to adapt while I'm

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,550
dealing with this situation on my team

00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:35,890
so my team has been really supportive a

00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:37,600
lot of the things that I really

00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:39,850
appreciated were like having the

00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,820
flexibility to do to work when I want to

00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:45,400
where I want to so sort of flexible

00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:47,050
schedule they were always very insistent

00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,660
you know that I take care of myself

00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:51,100
so not a culture of like but you know

00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:54,090
you didn't work five hours say or

00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:57,580
whatever also there were some

00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:59,620
communication things we changed as I was

00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:03,280
going through as I was learning that

00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:04,960
were helpful so asynchronous

00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,060
communication where possible is super

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,590
helpful if there's a conversation in

00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:10,990
slack and it's going on and it's about

00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:12,670
my code and I'm at a point where like I

00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:14,200
got to stop typing and I don't feel like

00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:16,780
I can keep up yet with the voice thing

00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,970
you know it puts me in a position where

00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,640
I have to choose whether I am able to

00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:25,120
participate or like do I risk my health

00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:27,010
right so shifting if it's communication

00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,630
about the PR happens in the PR if it's

00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:32,080
about it's not JIRA ticket have an image

00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:33,640
your ticket if or do we need a how quick

00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,500
zoom meeting zooms are great you know

00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,270
I've been trying to you know I think

00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,650
people shy about just getting on a video

00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,760
but sometimes like those are super

00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:45,150
helpful and give people a break from the

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,150
keyboard so things like that yeah

00:45:52,609 --> 00:45:57,929
yeah so there are definitely times with

00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:01,799
the iPhone where I wish I had talent on

00:45:57,929 --> 00:46:03,989
there by default so the question is what

00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:05,849
do I see a time where this might be the

00:46:03,989 --> 00:46:09,539
default way to interact with the iPhone

00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:11,910
or maybe a computer I think it could be

00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:14,729
I'm not sure everyone right now is so

00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:16,949
used to keyboard and mice but with

00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:19,019
technology getting good enough to where

00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:20,849
people might use it because it's good

00:46:19,019 --> 00:46:22,380
and not because it's your last resort

00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:27,390
then things might be a little more

00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:29,160
interesting there's a like the the Apple

00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:30,569
is now supporting voice control for

00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,849
iPhone which I'm really excited about

00:46:30,569 --> 00:46:34,079
and curious to see how that's going to

00:46:32,849 --> 00:46:35,609
work and I think it's starting to become

00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,140
a little more normalized that like hey

00:46:35,609 --> 00:46:38,519
guess what there are other ways to

00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,679
interact with computers or just aren't

00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:52,529
your keyboard and mouse so yeah we'll

00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:54,659
see I don't know the question is about

00:46:52,529 --> 00:46:58,049
how's my experience with slack and its

00:46:54,659 --> 00:47:00,839
accessibility so there's one problem

00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:03,839
with slack which is not necessarily how

00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:05,279
it's built but just that things are

00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,900
happening in real time and if you have

00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:08,939
someone who's dealing with an injury or

00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:11,219
something they might be in a position

00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:12,900
where hey I'm up on my 30 minutes I got

00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:15,749
a I got to cut this or I'm you know

00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,069
risking like aggravating my symptoms and

00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,849
I'm gonna be out for a week or something

00:47:17,069 --> 00:47:19,559
you know

00:47:17,849 --> 00:47:23,009
that can be a little bit of a challenge

00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:25,289
so I think slack is a great tool but

00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:28,469
using it for the times where it really

00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:30,390
is necessary to have sort of like a real

00:47:28,469 --> 00:47:33,179
time conversation is good in terms of

00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:34,890
the application itself they did build a

00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:37,919
lot of keyboard shortcuts into so it's

00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:40,829
not completely you know unusable for me

00:47:37,919 --> 00:47:43,049
I can use it but it's sort of using the

00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:45,659
model of tabbing through applications to

00:47:43,049 --> 00:47:47,759
access everything which if you have to

00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:49,289
know how many tabs it takes to get

00:47:47,759 --> 00:47:51,900
places it sort of adds an extra layer of

00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:54,659
like frustration when you use a tool so

00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,679
I much prefer like the new stuff on Mac

00:47:54,659 --> 00:47:57,569
they're starting to do a thing where you

00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:58,420
can get the I think it's show numbers or

00:47:57,569 --> 00:48:00,460
something and then you

00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,809
and it's sort of like how the Vivian

00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,150
stuff works and then you can jump to the

00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:10,210
thing you need so I'm hoping things move

00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:12,250
toward more towards that model yeah the

00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:22,690
one in chrome is Vimy um yeah mmm it's

00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:23,829
like vim free browser I guess yeah sure

00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:25,420
so the question is whether I have

00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:27,280
microphone recommendations and whether I

00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:30,130
had to sort hunt through some to find

00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,780
one that work well so the talent

00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,920
community already has a lot of opinions

00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,180
which is great so you can pop in there

00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,510
and be like yo what microphone should I

00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:39,280
get and people will help you out I did

00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:42,730
go through a few cycles I didn't jump

00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,260
right to the you know XLR mics I started

00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,640
with just like a gaming headset to like

00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,619
is this even gonna work I don't know

00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,760
let's you know see ya see how this works

00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:52,950
and that that actually worked quite well

00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:55,690
I have been told to steer clear from

00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:57,640
wireless mics because the latency can

00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:59,680
create a little bit more headache so

00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:03,010
I've stuck with cords this one's an

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,589
audio technica I think cardioid mic and

00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:08,950
this one so far has been been my

00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:11,109
favorite in terms of picking up only my

00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:12,549
sound and sometimes it it's a little

00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:13,900
sensitive so I have to talk louder so

00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:15,880
you see through the talk on the next

00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,440
next slide next slide so I think some of

00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,390
that like it's still need a two week but

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,099
keep in mind like I've only been doing

00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:22,359
this for like nine months so I'm

00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:26,980
scratching the surface of what all this

00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:28,750
can do and you know I'm sort of like

00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:30,460
peachy ferdi with a keyboard but now

00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:32,290
it's like well what's next is care other

00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:35,069
things I can do better than a keyboard

00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,069
could ever could right

00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:52,240
yeah so the question is when I'm on zoom

00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:53,650
whether my voice system will serve take

00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,080
over and try to do stuff while I'm

00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:59,110
talking and it could if I don't put it

00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:01,660
to sleep if I forget so yeah that's a

00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:03,280
thing I can say talents sleep it's gonna

00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:07,090
hear me so if I say the other one it'll

00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:09,250
wake up but it it would but I just

00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:11,170
usually put it to sleep the one that's

00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:13,570
really annoying is dragon sometimes

00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:17,380
we'll just like spontaneously like wake

00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:19,150
up and and then you get all kinds of

00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,650
like you know random stuff where it's

00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,120
you know who knows what's gonna do is

00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,890
talent good one is dragging one win who

00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:27,900
knows so then I gotta make sure I'm

00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:27,900
draggin back to bed you know but anyway

00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:34,810
yeah I think that's the end of my

00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:36,250
questions but I will be here I'll be

00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:39,310
like out there to answer more questions

00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:55,330
if you have or I'm also on Twitter so

00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:56,980
yeah thank you all for coming so I have
