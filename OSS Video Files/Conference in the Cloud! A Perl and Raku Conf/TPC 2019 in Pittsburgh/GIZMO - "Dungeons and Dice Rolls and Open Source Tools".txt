Title: GIZMO - "Dungeons and Dice Rolls and Open Source Tools"
Publication date: 2019-06-18
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	While pencil, paper, and dice will always be important parts of running a D&D campaign, with modern times come modern tools for the Dungeon Master.

In this talk I'll share the software that I use in my D&D campaigns and how you can use them to make your campaigns be both less work and more fun.

You'll learn how software like Freeplane, Inkscape, Roland, Vim, Git, and Mojo can help bring your games to life for both you and your players

hello everybody welcome to dungeons and

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:10,110
dice rolls with open-source tools like

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,570
thank Gary for creating the game that

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,219
many of us still enjoy and play today

00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:18,960
and here's to celebrating a life well

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:21,449
played role playing games consists of

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,699
players doing some role in some

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,460
fictional settings these players then

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,880
interact with that setting their choices

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,399
change and affect that sitting there's

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,790
one person that creates and manage that

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,320
settings for the players it's called the

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,420
dungeon master it's what was in the

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,030
original RPG oath Gary or the DM

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:46,230
sometimes referred to generically as the

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:49,250
game master or GM this talk is focusing

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:52,559
primarily on tabletop role-playing games

00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,180
these traditionally and primarily are

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,859
played with pencil and paper and a

00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,000
variety of polyhedral dice there are

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,489
different genres of role-playing games

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,460
mostly you know having the differences

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,200
really being like the setting which

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:13,350
influences the roles that the the

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:17,060
players themselves are doing for example

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:22,979
there's cyberpunk this is shadow run a

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:25,860
long-running RPG sometimes it's in the

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,960
far future science fiction setting like

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,299
Star frontiers where he can be the some

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,860
alien race or some just Rando human

00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:37,560
there's even a post nuclear war

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,090
post-apocalyptic games like Gamma world

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,460
I mean who doesn't want to be a mutant

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,860
you know causing having two brains and

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,990
interact with a sentient people sized

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:51,600
rabbits however what I'm going to

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,020
primarily talk about in this talk is my

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,530
experience with the foundational

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,920
role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:05,790
specifically the advanced edition it's

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,520
also called the first edition or 1e so

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,760
the players choose of roles like center

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,819
classes and broadly speaking within

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,190
DMV you could be a fighter hacking

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,920
slashing killing things uh you could be

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,830
a cleric of priests build cast bells

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,990
given to you from your deity

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,670
you could play magic-user bending the

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,540
rules of reality

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,920
and blowing stuff up or you could be a

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:37,260
thief willing to bug folks for their

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:40,140
their stuff now the way the players

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,800
interact with a setting is through

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,730
encounters typically these encounters

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:51,959
involve combat sometimes it's solving a

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:56,489
puzzle to get some form a treasure and

00:02:51,959 --> 00:03:01,019
then those encounters will take place in

00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:02,430
a dungeon that's under a hundred feet or

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,610
it could be an old and despotic city

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,650
ruled by cabal of wizards so that's my

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,610
quick little introduction to what RPGs

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:13,620
are since I haven't got back in the

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:20,400
gaming about it just over a decade ago

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:24,930
I've been a DM and and so I have to

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:29,610
create a whole bunch of ideas to keep

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:32,519
the players happy and I have to have

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:35,640
lots and lots and lots of ideas because

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,989
you never know what players do even

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,959
after you've been gaming with them for a

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,970
long long time they will come up ways

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,500
that will surprise you and interact with

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,500
your ideas that you don't expect

00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:53,220
so by also having the eggs ideas you

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:56,670
give the players options and so they're

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,530
not kind of railroaded down whatever ID

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,459
or path you give them it gives them a

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:05,280
sense of agency and control and so the

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,560
software for my idea current creation

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:14,450
retention is using mind map software and

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:17,090
email for mind mapping software

00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,430
I like to use free playing mind mapping

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,550
software lets you write down kind of

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,650
ideas and no real order and then you

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,090
kind of branch off on those ideas you

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,030
know it's kind of like a brainstorming

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,390
session and this could also be used to

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:35,030
keep track of events that happened in

00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:40,250
your game and specifically like about

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:42,140
those ideas you had and the reactions of

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:45,400
the setting that the players did to

00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:48,770
interact with that encounter whatever

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:52,070
here's an example this is a top level of

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,730
a mind map from Earth really early in my

00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,150
campaign

00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,550
just a couple ideas you know the setting

00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:03,890
specific where they are who's a big bad

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:09,290
currently some more settings some crazy

00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:12,970
thing in the setting and then quickly

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:15,230
you branch out from those ideas like

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,960
these dwarves have all these things

00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:21,620
going on you got these giants and these

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:26,300
this place so it quickly becomes

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,860
complicated and here's this is like five

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,410
levels deep in the mind map in terms of

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:34,520
my ideas and what happened so this is

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,960
mostly a historical document for me and

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,919
it's nice to have the history because

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,080
then I know what the players did in a

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,340
specific spot they might have interacted

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,979
with what's called a non-player

00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:51,440
character a a person in the setting that

00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:53,600
is kind of significant at least I try

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,760
and make them significant they may not

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,700
be in terms of how the players use it so

00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,430
then I know what that NPC might know

00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:06,650
based upon their interactions with the

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:08,180
characters a buddy told me he when he

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,340
thinks of ideas he's typically not

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,830
anywhere near someplace to easily jot

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:16,039
some down so he uses email he sends

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:18,430
himself emails about any random ideas

00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,720
and I've started doing that in terms of

00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,640
what I have ideas you know I might be

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,530
walking around I'm gonna be just sitting

00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,080
on the bench

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,300
wait for you know kids to get done

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,010
running at the cross country and for my

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,870
email client I typically am using

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:37,270
Thunderbird on my phone I'm using canine

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:41,080
and also when you have these ideas it's

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:43,480
it's good to not just have a what your

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,350
ideas or if you're reading Twitter and

00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:49,870
you someone makes this comment about you

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:53,890
know this weird rule they see to include

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:56,800
how you might use that idea and how your

00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:59,470
players might see it I'm still trying to

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,870
figure out how to work this one in so in

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,090
addition to all these ideas you got to

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,670
think about where are these encounters

00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:11,950
and ideas and the players interact and

00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:15,460
that typically means Maps this is a

00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:19,360
section of the world setting of the

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:22,000
system I use and maps are really part

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,380
and parcel of being a DM for making Maps

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,010
I like to use a tool called Inkscape

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:31,990
it's a scale scalar vector graphics so I

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,270
so when I make them I don't have to

00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:38,650
worry about pixelization or the

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:41,919
resolution of the map until I have to

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:44,080
you know export into a JPEG or PNG file

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:48,400
for the places that only accept those

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,830
formats instead of SVG files here's an

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,680
example of a level of a mega dungeon

00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:57,550
Omega dungeon is layers and layers and

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,380
layers of you know these maps and with

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,760
the digital map I don't have to tape

00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,540
together a whole bunch of sheets of

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:07,720
graph paper to drive um there is some

00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:10,270
joy you know to hand draw a map but it's

00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,610
hard to make changes easily in terms

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,560
you're erasing things and redrawing

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:18,310
things the players will have to course

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,930
use paper if they want to map it and the

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,720
scale I usually work at when I migrate I

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,180
use like five squares to the inch but

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,590
also being digital I don't have to worry

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,169
about the size in terms of how big a

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:32,169
paper it is with that five squares to

00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:35,789
the scale this would be a we need a 22

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:38,200
inch by 34 inch piece of paper to map

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:41,410
but it's just you know electrons on my

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,390
computer when you're making the mega

00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:46,000
dungeon map you have many many layers

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,560
and it's kind of nice sometimes to see

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,710
how those layers interact to make sure

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,360
this pit falls into this level or these

00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,480
stairs go down to this level but not

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,600
this level and I have little notes about

00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:02,320
scale to let me know how deep this

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,550
stairway is and how everything fits

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,970
together I could have used something

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:09,640
like a 3d CAD package for this or maybe

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,620
even an axonometric grid but that's

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,780
sounds like work to me and I'm lazy at

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,440
heart so I just make sure things work as

00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:19,150
I need when players aren't busy raiding

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,190
dungeons for treasures and killing the

00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:26,350
monsters they need a place to hang out

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:28,360
and that means seats or talents and so

00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,340
you make towns and cities for the

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,810
players to hang out in because sometimes

00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,900
the encounters could happen there you

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,340
know they might need to talk to somebody

00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,580
about some kind of magic or treasure

00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:42,250
they found this is a place called stone

00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,800
Brook in the setting and I just kind of

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,600
when I initially needed a town I just

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,770
made it willy-nilly willy-nilly I just

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,990
kind of placed buildings how I thought

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:54,100
they would how things make sense to me

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:55,360
at the time and recently I was talking

00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,570
to you know one of the guys that's in my

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,690
campaign talking about how how to make

00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,710
cities just I find cities really tedious

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,120
so I decided to do something even more

00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,340
tedious and think about how a city would

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,680
grow over time in this case you know the

00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:13,480
city has been around about 300 years how

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:15,910
would I organically grow that see most

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,150
graphics programs have this concept of

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:21,070
layers so I could have my original map

00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,520
in there and say okay the cities

00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:27,519
typically start with a castle urkki

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:30,220
that's my kernel start there

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,899
then I did okay there's people they're

00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,879
gonna need a wall to protect them and

00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:36,009
places to live and place to keep their

00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,259
food no big thing

00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:40,269
out of players you know you can hide and

00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:41,499
show different parts layers as you're

00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:43,029
working through you know kind of like

00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:44,290
you know Ella's animal you see animators

00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:46,540
back in the day to a hand drying they'll

00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:50,110
flip back and forth kissy things so I

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:54,449
can see where roads were where I had

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,449
them where I think they should be now

00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:00,759
later in time you know the city gets up

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,160
here in Wharf area so they got some

00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:04,720
commerce going on maybe they want to

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,240
extend the walls to protect the

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,339
merchants goods and stuff like that

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,019
maybe have like a little parade ground

00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:12,999
for the cavalry now that they got more

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:17,740
people to protect and you know more

00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:20,980
troops and this is all the layers all at

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,600
once you know this is my final phase

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,610
where I think the wall should be this is

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,740
the wall where was I initially made it

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:31,059
you know and you know all the roads

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:35,279
where they were might be just it's a big

00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:39,879
mess but it shows how with using digital

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,379
tools you can you can easily reimagine

00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:45,839
and rework things and kind of edit

00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:50,350
things as you go sometimes need to make

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,670
your own graph paper because it they

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,339
don't always do what you want in this

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,709
case I needed a hex within the hex

00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:59,019
within a hex these big hexes here

00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:01,259
represent like 25 miles of territory

00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:04,600
this is what I'm trying to imagine

00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,339
terrain you know it's in the big map but

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,249
I showed you early little snippet it's

00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:10,990
general parts of the terrain I'm trying

00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:13,629
to maybe be more specific get more

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:15,670
granular and then inside that these

00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:17,649
these smaller hexes where they're five

00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:20,170
miles yeah so there's 5 hexes across

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:23,259
roughly I'm sucking at finer detail and

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:26,199
inside that these tiny little one-mile

00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:27,519
hexes that's a you know I want to plot

00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:29,259
where the characters are in terms of

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,350
their slugging their way across a

00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:34,029
mountain or a marsh and trying to more

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,709
accurately keep track of where they are

00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:37,709
within the map

00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:45,120
and this you you can't really see it

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,390
because I did a hex within a hex you

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,890
can't really see it here so it's you can

00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:53,760
kind of see it a little bit better here

00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:55,020
it's the the resolution that the doesn't

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,300
show up but you know I did the same

00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,320
thing these are tiny tiny linux's so I

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:03,330
can know where the characters are

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:05,850
they're traveling sometimes you have to

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:11,160
do with raster images the the maps you

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:13,200
get or aren't PNG or JPEG and so I used

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,630
 the new image manipulation program

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,839
to do any editing or changing or

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:21,570
extending of those files like for

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,480
example this is a map someone made of

00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,589
the area that where stone work is to

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,529
better you know show where like the

00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:30,149
swamps are some forest than the hills

00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:32,760
but he had something special in mind in

00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:35,370
this house I didn't and I wanted to get

00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,920
rid of it so I could use to like

00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:41,070
choose the free select tool hey there's

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:46,620
a hex that's empty select it copy paste

00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:48,779
it stick it over where that was hey

00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:52,020
there's no more stupid little annotation

00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:53,310
was there you know added some towns that

00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:57,750
are under the control of the dude go

00:13:53,310 --> 00:14:01,080
Stonebrook which is nice so after have

00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:03,300
all these maps I want to know what's in

00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,470
them so any keys and notes what's going

00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:10,230
on in those places and for that I use

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:14,730
text files and I my editor of choice is

00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:17,190
Bill and it's just I my style for these

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:20,040
keys is really terse simple descriptions

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:22,200
I don't need walls of text very simple

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,980
descriptions of the monsters or any

00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:30,180
treasure they might have so no real form

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:33,120
at the moment and also I take notes as a

00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,070
player so I know what's happened what

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,860
the DM did to me in the game or

00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,510
information he passed along and this is

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,779
when I started thinking about well maybe

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:46,460
I want to use markdown in my um my

00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:51,080
note-taking even in my keys

00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:52,700
and markdowns are I mean I I've been a

00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,200
lake tech person sure so if I'm gonna do

00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,440
something that I want something nice and

00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:01,010
neat I use late tech but I've kind of

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,779
slowly been won over by markdown it's

00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,040
still basically it's kind of like wood

00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:06,410
heat to me it reminds me a lot of what

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,779
you text what you think it came from and

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,630
it does a really good job of being

00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:15,620
transformed into other formats you know

00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:17,930
and the example here from article about

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:21,320
marked out for dummies no here's the

00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:26,510
markdown and it easily gets created this

00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:29,450
nice HTML and what you have markdown you

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:32,540
could use this tool called pan dock

00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:36,040
which takes the markdown and it can not

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:38,450
just transform to HTML but PDFs and epub

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,100
so you could create like a handout for

00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:43,130
the players that not just plain text but

00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:47,680
this a nice PDF file or an ePub document

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:51,020
so enough digression

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,150
another thing DMS especially in first

00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,790
edition there's lots and lots and lots

00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:58,970
of tables you reference and roll on you

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:01,100
know - maybe randomly create some the

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,450
party encounters or it's like oh they

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,800
ran into some monster let's see what

00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,190
kind of monster

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,370
so Rick the crane is tool called roland

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:15,740
to automate the the rolling and

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:17,900
resolution of those tables and so far it

00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,820
just exists as a github project I've

00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,520
been kind of pushing them slowly to

00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:25,790
maybe see panna Phi it he says well it's

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:28,490
that decorative software and you know

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,870
but I disagree it's it's great I just

00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:33,709
want to be see kind of tight so it's

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:37,670
easier to for the people to use so let's

00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:40,970
look at how Roland is used so monsters

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:42,890
have gluten and they have this treasure

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,470
type associated with them they may have

00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:47,649
more than one and you can't enroll to

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,810
see how much different coins they have

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:52,900
gems and jewels and for the most part

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,060
this server is going to look at

00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,850
a treasure this is pretty

00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:00,520
straightforward there are sub tables for

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,230
gems and jewelry and magic here's the

00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,140
jewels sub table there's different

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,910
values of jeweled gems this is the

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,910
jewelry sub table different values of

00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:14,290
jewel if there's magic items

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,760
it's another table and then you go into

00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:19,150
that table and you get you know this is

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:24,040
kind of like the entry of tables to roll

00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:27,490
on and so what I did is I used roll on

00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:33,160
Roland to I create the table so Roland

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:34,480
can know what to do and then rolled it

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,200
you know assuming you're comfortable you

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,280
know with computers it's not that the

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,679
greater random number generator

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,650
typically depends how how comfortably

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,120
feels the entropy it has and so I you

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,380
know grade roll into to roll in treasure

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,840
tables for me so I can just you know

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:55,120
take royal treasury and here's the loop

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,450
and the thing about Roland is it's yeah

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:02,200
mo it's the mo all the way down for the

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:04,510
most part and um yeah most pretty cool I

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,440
like it it's a nice human readable data

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:10,210
serialization language I see used a lot

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,330
for configuration files I use it for

00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,950
config files and I'll note the founders

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,370
there's three founders of its Clarke

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:21,720
Evans or invent kiki and one of our own

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:23,650
mad scientist um indeed net DOTA net

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,809
that's nice but yeah you know you have

00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:30,540
raised key hashes and stuff like that

00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:34,780
even has boolean stuff in it China music

00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:37,330
and this is an example of a Roland table

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:41,170
specifically this is the the table for

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:43,570
that class a treasure type so these are

00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:47,260
just really arrays with you know some

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:50,350
special syntax Rick put in so and what

00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:53,980
Roland does it's going to execute each

00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:56,110
these elements and this one's saying oh

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,360
you're gonna look for a file and that's

00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,470
gonna be like another rolling table case

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,870
in point

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:05,020
here's the magic table and this is where

00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:07,179
his syntax he created yo we're gonna

00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,390
roll some dice it's gonna be D 100

00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:12,789
percentage and based upon the rolls if

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,650
it's a 1 through 30 a 3% chance which is

00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:16,450
what was there before

00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,970
we're gonna do this thing we're gonna

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,580
roll a 1 d 1 this is my hack I think I

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,260
could have short do this better but

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,480
we're all out three times and this on

00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:29,049
this result you work on this one

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,429
otherwise nothing happens so we go to

00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:33,070
the magic table here's what it looks

00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:35,470
like so you base your D hunger based on

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:39,400
that going to go in another table and

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:43,200
then this is that end terminating table

00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:48,190
of the various rods and wands and stands

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,830
and so now I created this command line

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,020
program and I didn't really want to have

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:58,690
to walk someone through the install of a

00:19:53,020 --> 00:20:01,299
non C Panta fide module and I decided

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:05,400
well I will defy it and for that I chose

00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:09,940
a the mojolicious framework to do that

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:12,429
and instead of taking my early treasure

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,380
table created Roland program I took

00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:16,480
another resource which is encounter

00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,159
tables basically raining where you are

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,580
in the world based on terrain you can

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:24,900
encounter stuff and I converted this

00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:28,000
resource into a rolling table a rolling

00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,190
application and this is the tables in

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,590
the counter Gately you basically have a

00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:34,900
location you have these kind of

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,690
encounter subtypes and then based on the

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:41,289
terrain it's at you roll on another

00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:43,330
table and so for this exercise we're

00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:46,360
going to see what's happenin Alice

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,980
mercury as a encounter this is what it

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,150
looks like on the map so I have two for

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,940
me to figure out the Train that looks

00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:55,659
like a mountain but there's a gazetteer

00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,789
in the rolls tells me okay Alice mercury

00:20:55,659 --> 00:21:01,690
oh it's not just a mountainous island

00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:07,789
it's an extinct volcano so

00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:10,249
and so this is the volcanic terrain map

00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:11,990
with the different subtypes of

00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:14,240
encounters and say you know we get a

00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,490
natural encounter and you know I roll a

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:21,049
fever goes what's that encounter look

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:26,240
like PC gets a fever for some number of

00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:28,190
days so I took that on that whole list

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,100
of tables and I made rollin tables out

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:35,090
of it you know same thing nice results

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:37,909
and based if you know the location and

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,580
the terrain like say that we were on the

00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:44,960
volcanic terrain type role on this and

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:47,869
you know fever this is the entry for

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,499
that what the fever looks like in my

00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:53,269
program I try to process all these roles

00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:58,070
if I if I find something that looks like

00:21:53,269 --> 00:22:01,309
a role I'll try and process that excuse

00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:03,440
me and yes this is a kind of fun

00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:05,119
exercise because I this is what really

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,879
got me to learn how to create dispatch

00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,169
tables so I could keep calling the

00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:11,869
dispatch table as I try to keep

00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:13,399
processing tables tables and tables so

00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:16,549
now I have a command line program to do

00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:19,940
the encounter I web a fight it which is

00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:21,499
basically some routes it's you know

00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,899
here's the top level you know there's

00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:28,220
many many many injuries you know here's

00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:30,200
Alice Mercury clicked on that and then

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:32,389
it's like we I had to go through and

00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,559
choose what terrain types are associated

00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:39,619
with each location so we got a volcano

00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:41,419
and the fever as you notice that there's

00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:44,869
no 2d6 here I was able to process that

00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:46,730
and make an actual result so to say one

00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:48,860
of the characters gets a fever for four

00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,539
days and then you get a you know make

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,309
them think that they're dying or

00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:54,110
something like that and have to deal

00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:58,990
with that disease they think it's a

00:22:54,110 --> 00:23:02,600
disease so not content to do that I

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:06,950
thought I might my son wanted me a run a

00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,090
game for his friends and I didn't want

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,889
them for their first session to roll up

00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,200
a character so that okay I'll I'll pre

00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:14,350
generate some characters

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,240
and then I thought well what if I make

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:19,270
an app that does that so other people in

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,010
the gaming community mount part of can

00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,870
you use this app to generate characters

00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:25,030
for like conventions you know a lot of a

00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,950
lot of my friends go to conventions and

00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:29,620
run games and you don't want people in

00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:32,470
the convention to spend time making

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,750
characters so that okay but I also don't

00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,280
want all these DMS to spend a lot of

00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,470
time you know filling out sheets even

00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,050
though there's form fillable sheets for

00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:44,410
them to use for the characters is still

00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:48,250
time to type even all that in so I

00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:52,000
created a program to generate character

00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:54,640
sheets based upon just the stats for the

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,530
characters its class in its level and

00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,850
it'll spit out a PDF so let's hoping

00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:03,700
that those littles effort is possible

00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:07,990
you can create most of the data you

00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:09,490
needed for characters you know side once

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,850
again Mozilla just had some drop-down

00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:15,130
menus or a text area they can enter the

00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:17,890
information and they'll spit out a

00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:20,110
poorly hard-to-see PDF file with all

00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:23,800
information is there's like four pages

00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:25,210
of information to fill out and I try and

00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,970
fill out as much that it's possible for

00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:30,730
the characters or for the in the DMS um

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:34,360
I'm mostly satisfied with it it's doing

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:35,940
okay and then post Coast Conference I'll

00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:40,690
probably put more work into it

00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:44,710
so throughout all of this I use get to

00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:46,930
track changes so it's you know I don't

00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,310
have to do it cuz it's just me but I

00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:50,380
like to do it because then I could

00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:55,150
especially with my SVG files I can roll

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:57,820
back changes I made in my math crap I

00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:59,440
didn't want that try to have meaningful

00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:03,010
commit messages you know this is from my

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,280
blog for my rework of that Stonebrook

00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,280
City

00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:11,920
so this one really isn't a tool I use

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,390
but it does make possible the things I

00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:17,560
like to do in terms of the games I play

00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:19,330
the og L or the open game license was

00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,310
created by the Wizards of the coast the

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,460
people that currently own the trademark

00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:26,680
and copyright for up Dungeons & Dragons

00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:29,620
did this in 2002 license portions of

00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:34,980
their third edition game to kind of help

00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:37,060
amp up third party people to publish

00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,850
material for the game you know they

00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:45,220
created this system reference document

00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:47,620
and out of this simple need for them a

00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:51,360
whole plethora of Dien systems emerged

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:53,260
because they decided okay this stuff is

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,390
intellectual property you can't touch

00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,430
this but sutter stuff not just of how

00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,910
you can use these mechanics and go and

00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:03,910
when the first my first interface is

00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:06,220
with this was odd Zurich there's a bunch

00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,930
of guys that like first edition first

00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,860
edition if you've ever read the books

00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:13,060
especially Dungeon Master's guide it's

00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,800
kind of a mess an organization so they

00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:19,420
kind of this old-school reference an

00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:21,340
index compilation which took as much of

00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,870
the you could under the O GL and put it

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,480
under one book in terms of trying to

00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:28,810
organize it and index it you know so I

00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,310
the end index compilation and this is a

00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,630
pretty good reference if you want to do

00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:35,620
something that's pretty close to the

00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:39,640
first edition D&D another one labyrinth

00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:42,190
Lord this is a clone of basic a D&D I

00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,820
came into this because I'm in a game

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:47,920
that Rick Cygnus runs and it's basic but

00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:53,290
he uses lanlan Florida you know as a way

00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:55,620
to expand upon what basic D&D has and

00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:58,330
out of this also came what the game I

00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:00,100
currently use most is this Hyperborean

00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:03,520
or more formally the astonishing

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:05,140
swordsman sorcerers of hyperborea I like

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,850
this system because you know it takes

00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,550
first edition and basic mesh them

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:12,130
together and kind of polishes a

00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:16,000
and then there's tons and tons and tons

00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:21,060
of gaming systems that use the og L to

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:24,280
do cool stuff and different ideas

00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:27,010
another tool I use not let's say this is

00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,800
really less open source is called rule

00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:31,750
20 it's hard especially as I got older

00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,250
and had kids and busy with life it's

00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:37,930
really hard to have face-to-face games

00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:39,580
well sit on the same table and play roll

00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,200
20 makes it easy in terms of people

00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,110
don't have to be physically near each

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,840
other they can kind of sit around the

00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:50,860
computers and play games together didi

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,510
games these are some of the games you

00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,180
know this is a game this is Rick's game

00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:57,030
this is a game I'm in this is the my

00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:00,190
current online game and I ran it a

00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:03,490
traveler game a long time ago and then I

00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:08,230
have a just like when I'm trying to do

00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:09,610
things in real xx world xx I'm called

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,310
open source but they definitely have

00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:15,820
shared resources that make available the

00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:18,790
the big one is character shoes people

00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:22,060
create character sheets to use in the

00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:24,040
various games people play on roll 25 ye

00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:27,820
fishing dungeon area gets lots of

00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,830
support people write API scripts to do

00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:33,730
cool things with in real xx in terms of

00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,900
the map area and actions I have

00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,640
contributed a little bit you know I'd

00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,380
say I ran a classic traveler game and I

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,930
wanted to try my hand at create a

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,770
character sheet and use it in roll 20 so

00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,770
that was fun

00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:51,379
so in summary for ID creation and

00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,769
retention I like to use a mind map

00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:57,470
software and for that it's free playing

00:28:53,769 --> 00:29:00,379
I email self ideas so I use email

00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:02,629
primarily Thunderbird if you create Maps

00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:04,370
town cities whatever I like to use in

00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:08,779
scape primarily and you know what I

00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:11,360
have to for maps keys and notes I use a

00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:14,179
text editor vim specifically starting to

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,129
use markdown more eventually use panda

00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:19,039
cause I have a crazy idea for my

00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:21,230
character sheet that uses pan doc and

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:24,679
for session tools I like use rollin for

00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:26,269
automating a lot of the table stuff so I

00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:29,659
don't have to spend five 10 minutes

00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:32,179
rolling something up or determining oh

00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:33,710
this ocher had all this loose why was

00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:34,820
there this magic item why was used this

00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,679
magic item I can do it quickly

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,830
beforehand and maybe take advantage of

00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,720
that I use ya know not just besides

00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,120
rollin but in terms of config files and

00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,450
somehow I organize some of the data I

00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,129
enter and use modulus just want to take

00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:54,259
my command line tools I want to share

00:29:49,129 --> 00:29:56,179
them online with people I use get for my

00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:58,789
change management to track my changes of

00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:00,350
course ogl I'm a secondary consumer

00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:03,259
because all the gaming systems I like to

00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:05,269
use or a primary low GL a neural 20

00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:08,210
because you know we're all busy and it's

00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:11,809
not easy always to get together and play

00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:16,389
face-to-face thank you I'm gives my math

00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:25,429
more gist but anywhere on the Internet's

00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:31,870
thank you any questions I'll take

00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:31,870
comments I don't care yes

00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:55,290
[Music]

00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:00,200
right well it's also you could create

00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,030
handles I have my dungeon

00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,500
I don't want if I want to hand some out

00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,960
you know I'm lazy here's the map of the

00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,210
dungeon I know I don't won't show them

00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,070
secret doors and any hidden things I

00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,720
could just say hide those layers printed

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,730
up here you go guys knock yourself out

00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,980
yeah layers are once I got the hang of

00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:17,360
layers and started using them it'sit's

00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:19,570
great terms of what you can do in terms

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,230
of creating not never mind

00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:25,220
in-game to do things with that so

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,290
anything else you like to know if there

00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:31,750
anything I missed

00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:31,750
come on I've seen demon we have opinions

00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:39,640
questions about how I could and software

00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:39,640
are you sure that's it yes well

00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,250
yeah there's lots of great ways I never

00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,470
thought about using emails away to like

00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,360
oh hey this idea I need a way to capture

00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,250
it I don't have a pen and paper or you

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,690
know screw it all it's email it's a

00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,980
great way but you know they I mean you

00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,930
know until emails nice because I could I

00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,670
could do a search if I take everything

00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:24,850
game ideas I can find all my game ideas

00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:30,490
and grab them and take them from an

00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:31,990
email and then put them into the top we

00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,360
also try and try remember to at least

00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,860
put the game idea in the subject and

00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,900
maybe something else I mean that way I

00:32:35,860 --> 00:33:05,590
can quickly search I'm because taking

00:32:39,900 --> 00:33:07,570
right yeah it's I mean I tried yeah just

00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:09,610
a general work no matter does have to be

00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,290
gaming earlier it's just finding ways to

00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:13,630
capture ideas like so I had my

00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,340
smartphone on me like and I just used

00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,450
like say k9 mail is my email client but

00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,730
I say could be it's easily some other

00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:20,560
app there's tons of note-taking apps I

00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:23,800
mean there's also there's also mind map

00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:26,170
apps for smartphones but it's at all

00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:38,080
it's really hard to do mind maps on a

00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:40,720
small screen yeah yeah yeah it's a six

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,510
eight so yeah and especially for stuff

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,190
like so I'm not a big five II player

00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:47,700
even three five

00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,750
well specially three five it's such a

00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,400
there's lots of mechanics in there so

00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:53,820
you really it healthy there's lots of

00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,840
tools to help people with that

00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:59,200
especially in rural 20 world 20 has a

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,850
lot of tools created for people and

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,160
likes a fifth edition' games or three

00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:04,420
five-hour games that are really what

00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,120
they call crunchy lot there's lots of

00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:11,530
rules and stuff and permutations for

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:15,880
classes and stuff but yeah it's like I

00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:19,210
was a big analog I you know writing

00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:21,550
making maps by hand but then Lex but

00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:23,680
what really flipped me into digital was

00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:27,970
when I was making that town and it's

00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:30,430
like drawing it and it's like I wanted

00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:33,390
to change where something was and that's

00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:35,320
really a pain to do on pencil and paper

00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:36,850
hey you know I could I can make a

00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:41,169
photocopy and start over in race ad or

00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:43,419
whatever both digital its electrons I

00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:45,580
don't care delete I couldn't get I had

00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:49,030
versions of that I could go back to if I

00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,140
wanted to or just I'd like to say tons

00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:53,830
of layers were made it's you know it's

00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:56,359
like map one map zero might be anything

00:34:53,830 --> 00:35:01,740
else yes

00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:10,680
to what Roland um that's on github yeah

00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:13,250
it's just it's our GBS well I say if you

00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,250
do as I say

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:24,210
yeah this RGB is rollin so yeah it's

00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,280
time the next Sam really want them to

00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,869
see Fanta fine I mean I can I can put

00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,089
some work input applied I might have put

00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:33,210
a plural quest in a couple years ago hey

00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:37,470
bring this yeah it's a poor request for

00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:38,700
me to you know actually to say hey Rick

00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,820
I think this is what you need the

00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,710
minimum need to do to do a to just to

00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,240
make it cheap and submit able you know

00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:48,630
but I'm not gonna push him cuz you know

00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,310
it's Rick I'm not gonna it's Kisco wait

00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:53,099
I really like Roland just because like

00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:55,380
say it's I can make tables I like say

00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:57,390
for the for that PC Jen you know PDF

00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,339
script that was there's not a lot of

00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,140
code there it's just I had to enter all

00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:03,599
of the information from the gaming

00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:05,490
system for characters into those tables

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,980
there's like twenty one thousand lines

00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,980
of text I mean short lines but still

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:23,760
alright questions yes that my players

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,339
have learned and when they're I live I

00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,470
let them talk when they're figuring

00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:29,579
things out and then they'll say

00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,140
something oh that's a great I mean

00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:33,750
because they'll they will always think

00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:36,380
about when I present them with the

00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,380
challenge or else

00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:58,180
yeah it's really a digital is really fun

00:36:54,369 --> 00:37:00,369
jables like okay so yeah cuz like I says

00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,930
I mean players will say things they'll

00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:03,609
have ideas of how things are ends like

00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,109
that's a great idea ever and it really

00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:07,450
pisses them off when I say that because

00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:10,890
like because like oh that's a great idea

00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,890
I'm gonna use that and then they rose I

00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,920
try not to be except I don't kill your

00:37:13,869 --> 00:37:16,240
characters I just create the

00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:31,060
opportunities for your characters to

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:34,330
kill themselves I love it all my players

00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:36,010
like saying I love of my plan it's I was

00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,810
talking to my one of my my name friends

00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:40,420
it's in the game it's like D I mean is

00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:42,820
kind of like anthropology because I know

00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:45,550
perfectly how the setting is or the

00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:47,770
problem presented to them and then I get

00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:49,630
to see what they're thinking as they're

00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:52,089
trying to solve it or walk down that

00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:53,650
path it's like what do you guys think I

00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:55,839
may say I don't say it out loud what are

00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:58,330
you thinking and it's like and it's like

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,920
that's like okay I don't mean I'm just a

00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:02,320
kind of a somewhat interested bystander

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,369
as they're going through this world it's

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,380
like it's just like I'm sitting there

00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:10,000
you know watching a pack of monkeys do

00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:12,220
whatever I mean it's it's fun so it's

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,099
it's it and you know I'm a big believer

00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:18,820
in rule zero if it's not fun why are you

00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:20,920
doing it so so if that's it actually

00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,550
remember rule zero have fun and remember

00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,410
Gary and celebrate a life well played

00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:30,840
thank you very much

00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:30,840
