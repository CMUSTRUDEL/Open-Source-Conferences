Title: GIZMO - "Dungeons and Dice Rolls and Open Source Tools"
Publication date: 2019-06-18
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	While pencil, paper, and dice will always be important parts of running a D&D campaign, with modern times come modern tools for the Dungeon Master.

In this talk I'll share the software that I use in my D&D campaigns and how you can use them to make your campaigns be both less work and more fun.

You'll learn how software like Freeplane, Inkscape, Roland, Vim, Git, and Mojo can help bring your games to life for both you and your players
