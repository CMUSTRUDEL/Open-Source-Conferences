Title: Michael Gage - "WeBWorK - A 23 year Perl success story"
Publication date: 2019-06-18
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	Hi. I'm Mike Gage and I'm the lead on one of the largest, "23 year old Perl projects that you've never heard of" WeBWorK.
WeBWorK is an open source online homework system which serves algorithmically generated mathematics homework problems to students and gives immediate feedback on their answers. This greatly enhances the effectiveness of homework. WeBWorK has been developed by mathematicians for mathematicians. It's well known to them (and to calculus students!!!) but to the open source, Perl and computer science communities, not so much. I'd like to change that.
WeBWorK has been used by over 1000 institutions for mathematics instruction at high schools, community colleges, and research universities. Mathematics topics range from all levels of pre-calculus/calculus, through linear algebra, differential equations, complex analysis, graph theory and more. The core code contains 37,000+ lines of Perl code and the 35K homework problems in the OpenProblemLibrary comprise another 3.2 million lines of Perl, all contributed by math professors.
WeBWorK's motto: "Ask the questions you should, not just the questions you can." Computer assisted homework should not limit the kinds of mathematics and STEM we teach nor the questions we ask, rather it should enhance and expand the students' experience.
WeBWorK remains a research experiment. Presenting advanced mathematics seamlessly in a way that encourages students to learn and which checks any correct answers automatically and reliably requires a lot of hard, intricate coding.
Chris Sangwin, himself the author of a similar homework system STACK used in the UK, described WeBWorK in his book Computer Aided Assessment of Mathematics:
"WeBWorK was built on freely available web technology, and the software is claimed to be used by more than 240 colleges and universities. Combining technologies in this way, rather than writing dedicated desktop software, was rather innovative at the time. The module construction and extensibility, both of the underlying mathematical software and front end, have enabled WeBWorK to evolve more or less continuously for the last fifteen years." - Chris Sangwin, 2012
WeBWorK has been developed by academic mathematicians for mathematicians and their students and while the contributors have varying degrees of computer skills there has been little direct contact with the computer science and FLOSS communities. WeBWorK has been unnecessarily isolated within its academic discipline silo. My hope is that a presentation to the Perl conference will help change that. We need the voices of those working intensely with code and and those experienced in working with FLOSS communities to propel WeBWorK and its support community to the next level and to avoid pitfalls and reinvention.
I'll present an overview of WeBWorK and of the PG language, a DSL in Perl, which allows one to render advanced mathematics questions and check the answers.
WeBWorK is a Perl success story and a major player in undergraduate mathematics education throughout North America. There is more work to be done. Come join the WW community.

[Music]

00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,069
I'm gonna here to introduce Michael gage

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,910
who's going to talk to us about web work

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:13,530
which is a widely used mathematics

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,120
homework application platform that most

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,880
people have never heard of unless you've

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,510
been to university in the last 15 years

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,990
as old as Perl as old as the AB see

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,960
anyway

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,550
pretty much pretty old i-i've actually

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,769
heard of it before because I worked on a

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,420
product that inspired it so I'm very

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:36,780
interesting this talk so let's welcome

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:38,700
Michael gage yeah there are all kinds of

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,290
interesting serendipitous things that

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,329
came up and coming here to talk this is

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,809
I've given talks like this a great deal

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,190
is to mathematics on Auden audiences I'm

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,829
a professor of mathematics at the

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,510
University of Rochester but this is the

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,370
first time I really talked to an

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,579
audience consisting entirely of coders

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,629
if you get bored I recommend the demo

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,949
WebWork Rochester dot edu site there

00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,479
explore it a little bit this I've put up

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,250
a whole bunch of demos where you can

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,220
actually get into these courses and play

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,869
with them as professors so first of all

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,450
what is what work it's a web-based

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,650
homework checker WebAssign if you're

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,880
familiar with that is a commercial

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,820
version which started about the same

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,130
time and web work are pretty similar it

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,240
specializes in mathematics and technical

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,470
subjects such as physics and so on it

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,509
was originally designed at the

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,490
University of Rochester and it's now

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,270
actively supported by a math and science

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,090
faculty nationwide it's been supported

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,470
is is supported by the mathematic

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,570
Association of America and it's received

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,100
a lot of support from NSF over the last

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,380
twenty years we're very grateful for

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,619
that so it was designed as an

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,930
experimental platform and it's

00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:54,659
successfully evolved over 23 years 23

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,579
years adding new features but keeping a

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,469
core of continuity it's it's still

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,590
pretty easy to bolt new features onto

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,700
web work it's not always elegant you can

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,799
sometimes see where the joins are but

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,869
usually works people have told me it's

00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,000
like building the airplane while I'm

00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:12,130
flying it which is true to some extent

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,790
but it's mostly worked if you just

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,599
cautious

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,310
it has a broad installed base of users

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,900
over a thousand institutions are listed

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,760
on our website as having at least tried

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,420
it it's moved well beyond the early

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,190
adopters at this stage and it has no

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,959
features in webrick which are likely to

00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,390
significantly impact mathematics classes

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,860
within a short time so that's one of the

00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,080
nice things about it it's kind of

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,120
already installed so any improvements to

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,120
this program and I eventually going to

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,670
ask people if they'd like to help will

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,930
get disseminated quickly because there

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,519
are lots of people using this thing

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,760
already that's the thing that took the

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,100
longest time open problem library

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,340
consists of more than 35,000 problems

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:59,170
it's been created by mathematics

00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,970
professors all across the country it's I

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,470
think really pretty high quality because

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,450
they created these problems for their

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,090
own students and for their own needs and

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,440
they keep revising them and resubmitting

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,260
them and so on

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,760
I think that's by and large better than

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,700
anything you can get from the commercial

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,470
publishers and the open experimental

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,840
architecture allows components of web

00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,880
work to Interop operate separately with

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,420
other software including moodle canvas

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:28,209
geogebra all get to all that so the

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,070
philosophy from the beginning was we

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,420
wanted to offer maximum extensibility

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,859
and flexibility and designing

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,329
mathematics questions we weren't

00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:35,859
actually sure whether this would work or

00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:39,700
not because you really teach mathematics

00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:43,120
online the answer is yes but that wasn't

00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,980
clear 23 years ago and our model became

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,799
asked the questions you should not just

00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,170
the questions you can if your can only

00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,209
answer multiple choice questions and you

00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,769
know short answer questions and so on

00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:55,329
and then you say well I can't teach that

00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:58,510
thing because I can't put it in our

00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:00,639
online homework that's not the way to go

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,410
online homework should increase the

00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,230
number of opportunities for education

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:10,480
not decrease them and I already

00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:13,090
mentioned the open primary so open

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,790
problem library the key features of

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,970
online homework in general and web work

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,910
in particular

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,410
including kappa was the the students get

00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,780
immediate feedback on the validity of

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,250
their answers and that gives the

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,480
students a chance to correct their

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,430
mistakes while they're still thinking

00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,340
about the problem we run this as

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:36,860
homework as practice not as quiz not as

00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:38,030
testing type of stuff the idea is we

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,010
know you don't know this stuff because

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,890
you haven't practiced it yet go practice

00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,910
it we've told you about it and it

00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,760
provides each students with

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,860
individualized units individualized

00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,480
versions and that means that they can

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,610
help each other without actually giving

00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,870
each other the answers and actually

00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,430
that's where most of the learning takes

00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,130
place is when the students help each

00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,170
other understand what's going on

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,900
students love the instant feedback

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,310
instructors like the automatic checking

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,470
here is just an example I'll give you

00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,740
some live examples eventually but I

00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:12,890
wanted to start off with with some of

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,050
these here's an example of a fairly easy

00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,150
problem the you want to find the

00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,550
interval described by this inequality

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:23,810
right here and the answer is all the

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,700
points between minus 3 and 7 and here

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,310
the question was asked like this and

00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,340
then the student answered minus 3 comma

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:34,430
35 over 5 but of course that evaluates

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,810
to 7 and so when they checks the answer

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,530
the answer is correct

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:42,320
it even simplifies it for you so parole

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,130
will do arithmetic for you so you don't

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,690
have to you can

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,340
the idea is to concentrate on the

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,140
mathematics and the important things not

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,979
worry about does the computer understand

00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,600
what I'm saying

00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:53,120
or various other things that we don't

00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,850
want to be focused on if you make

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,650
mistake so for example if you put this

00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,780
kind of bracket here that means that

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,150
that includes the endpoint 7 which is

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,410
not true in this case and so it tells

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,150
you that the type of the interval is

00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,490
incorrect if you just miss type

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,350
something it gives you an error message

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,680
and tells you a little bit about where

00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,330
you are this is the result of math

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,610
objects which I'm going to be telling

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,560
you a lot more later but again the idea

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,960
originally we would have to ask this

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,890
question by you know enter the end

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,800
beginning the left-hand endpoint and

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:29,090
then enter the right-hand endpoint and

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,969
you know that's that's not the way you

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,419
do it on paper

00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:37,229
right this minus 3/7 so we wanted to get

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:39,719
to that so this is just a quick look at

00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:43,289
what the thing looks like what the code

00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:45,839
looks like for this there's a context

00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:48,209
which is interval that's actually

00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,429
important because if I have three minus

00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:52,110
three comma seven that could mean all

00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:54,360
the points between minus three and seven

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,899
or it could be the point in the plane

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,129
and mathematicians know depending on

00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:01,139
which subject they're working on which

00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:05,969
it means and so the computer has to know

00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:08,610
that too and the math objects ideas by

00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:11,729
setting up the context parentheses now

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:16,499
means intervals and not points you could

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:20,639
set up a point this is where the math

00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:22,499
object is actually created this is a the

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,539
thing in quotes here is exactly what the

00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:26,669
answer is supposed to look like except

00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:28,949
that I've used dollar sign and a dollar

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:32,729
sign and dollar B and dollar sign C

00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:35,099
these are random number generator which

00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:35,789
picks fix points so that's different for

00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,999
every student

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:42,659
it's a pseudo-random number generator

00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:44,939
it's a keyed off a seed each student's

00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:47,759
problem has a particular has this text

00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,739
and that seed and between those two it

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,619
generates a unique problem for the

00:07:49,739 --> 00:07:56,189
student the begin text to end text is

00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:59,219
just printing and you see that we are

00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:00,899
using latex here to do to enter the

00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:03,719
formulas this isn't a very complicated

00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,969
formula so that's not hard and then down

00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:09,599
here at the bottom the answer of value

00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:11,249
sorry the the answer object not only

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,229
knows that it's an interval it knows how

00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:15,899
to Union itself with other intervals and

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:17,729
various other things like that but it

00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:19,649
also knows how to compare itself to the

00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,179
students answer so this is the

00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:24,419
instructors answer here this is the

00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:26,789
students answer and that's basically how

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:29,099
it works this whole thing there's some

00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:31,759
pre-processing that's done and then it's

00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:34,349
run through the safe compartment so that

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,229
really nasty pearl commands and so on

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:40,559
are a lot aren't allowed to execute and

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:41,680
the result is to produce HTML output or

00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,800
PDF out

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,630
you can do both okay so the main points

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,550
I want to make in this talk are that

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,880
what worked has made a major impact on

00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,590
math instruction and secondly the web

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,780
work is a substantial and interesting

00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,610
software project written mostly in Perl

00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,130
there are some JavaScript but it's

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,150
mostly for all 37 thousand lines of code

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:06,410
as far as like to determine and there's

00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,420
3.2 million lines of code in those

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:11,720
problems little problem that I just

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,780
showed you our github account is here

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,820
you can go look at it for yourself and

00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:21,410
again anything that we do will get

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:23,210
distributed distributed very rapidly by

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:28,280
academic standards that means within a

00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:31,840
year ok so here's what the outline of my

00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,840
talk is it's going to be

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,460
so I'm going to give a short history of

00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,230
web work and then I'm going to show you

00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,340
some demos and then I'm going to tell

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,980
you a little bit about the support

00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:54,970
community and again here are things that

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:57,520
you can look at if you get bored okay so

00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,590
you go back to 1995 all of these other

00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,560
talks have set up this thing really

00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:06,250
nicely with all this historical stuff so

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,080
in 1995 Frank Wilson our physics

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,810
department was using Kappa the thing

00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,160
Michaels has was helped developed it was

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,790
one of the earliest technical homework

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,200
systems

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,510
there were homework systems before that

00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,540
but not many did math Kappa did math and

00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:23,470
physics he wanted me to use it in the

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:25,300
math department and so I tried it worked

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,520
really well for physics problems but

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,800
didn't work quite as well for

00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,170
mathematics problems it was also pretty

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,270
limited because you could handle only 24

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,390
students at a time with direct dial up

00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:39,610
to a next computer there's mr. jobs and

00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,050
next right there so it needs to be

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,200
better and the question was whether or

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,090
not we could use newfangled web so now I

00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,160
need to go into my personal side a

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,560
little bit here indulge me

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,740
so I was a stent a graduate student in

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,770
Stanford in mathematics during the 70s

00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:00,340
and I met Doug Engelbart true

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:02,620
folk-dancing don't know who he is I'll

00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,660
explain in a minute he was at Stanford

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,960
Research Institute and he was the person

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,790
who convinced me that the important use

00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,680
of computers particularly in education

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:14,170
but in generals for communication and

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,530
not for number crunching that's

00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:20,650
absolutely obvious now but in 1972 it

00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:23,920
was not and in fact four years before in

00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,810
1968 he had created what's still known

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,280
as the mother of all demos if you're not

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,550
familiar with it you should google it

00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,160
it's kind of amazing Doug had invented

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,870
the mouse here's an example of it I

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,040
actually got to work with this one a

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,280
little bit

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,890
he gave this talk over the internet on

00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,440
all freedom nodes of the ARPANET that

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,499
was filled at the time between Berkeley

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,549
and

00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:52,799
Palo Alto and in general just convinced

00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:54,420
me that this this was might someday be

00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,579
useful for education and as a

00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,069
communication device not for solving

00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:01,470
numerical problems I eventually won the

00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:03,509
Turing award that came a little late I

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:07,160
think I don't think but the people the

00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:10,470
insiders know about his work

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,720
okay so bite so when the opportunity

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,540
came along 1995

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,759
I said well alright maybe we can use

00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,009
pearl and lay tech and the world wide

00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,139
web which has just started your book

00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:23,639
well the the browser had just come out

00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:24,209
and that scape browser just came out the

00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,600
year before

00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:29,959
Pachi server and cgi and we could put

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,459
all of these things together and

00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:35,639
duplicate what Kapil was doing except on

00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:37,350
a somewhat larger scale also that year

00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,239
as it happened the Rochester Renaissance

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,009
plan for the college was announced and

00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:43,649
suddenly as a result of that grading

00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:45,540
every web work assignment for every

00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:47,610
student becomes a priority particularly

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,709
in the math department before that we

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,779
just done weekly quizzes but that wasn't

00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:53,279
enough so web work which has been a

00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:56,429
hobby suddenly became a high priority

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,129
for the math department so Arnold Peyser

00:12:56,429 --> 00:13:01,589
and I were people started it with a

00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:04,350
couple of undergraduate interns we

00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:06,749
worked in 1996 Arne came up with the

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:09,660
word web work which is colliding web and

00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:13,619
homework together and in 1996 he taught

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:15,299
the first class calculus other math

00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:18,209
homework systems were starting about the

00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:24,089
same time WebAssign started in 1997 at

00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:28,199
NCSU he grades started in in Braska in

00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:31,139
1999 blonde kappahd I think started

00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:34,529
about 1999 the Catholic people had

00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:36,059
realized that yeah the Pearl and and the

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:39,480
web was the way to go and they'd

00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:41,189
combined a previous project in kappa to

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,999
create lawn Kappa which is still going

00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:47,730
and still open-source as his web work so

00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:49,619
by 1999 we had about a dozen research

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,989
universities using it it's strange how

00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:53,399
these things propagate I'm a

00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:55,019
differential geometry so the

00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,430
differential some differential geometry

00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,899
sorted using

00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,760
he's a number theorist some of them

00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,589
started using at Doug Ravenel was chair

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,960
of the department he convinced a couple

00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:08,220
of chairs to try it that's how things

00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:12,330
spread in academics we won the IC TCM

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:16,200
reward in 1999 and in 1999 we also got

00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:19,260
our first NSF grant myself

00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:23,490
Arnie Peyser and Vicki Roth who was

00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:26,720
director at such for educate excellence

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:31,170
in teaching and learning at Rochester

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,850
she was our evaluator and three of us

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:36,899
were kind of the beginning of the whole

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:47,670
project so we started working on where

00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:49,830
we're - this is a gorse which shows here

00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,660
are some of the people or working on

00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:55,100
this Sam Hathaway was an undergraduate

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:58,980
at the time David serve on is a

00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:01,050
geometers who's his chair at Union Union

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,310
College and an extraordinarily good

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:07,290
programmer you're gonna hear a lot about

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:08,970
him later Rob Van Dam joined us later I

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,920
hadn't realized he was going to be here

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:17,190
but he's here in the front row so you

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:18,839
can talk to him about this shortly after

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,720
that mathematics science Research

00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:24,360
Institute sponsored us and this is where

00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,480
we added a bunch of other things this is

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,339
where the math objects first got

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,140
invented we'd started on Pearl 4 which

00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,520
didn't have object orientation although

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,830
we kind of wrote that way

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,709
I was Perl 5 we could really use real

00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:39,810
math objects and that simplified things

00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:41,820
particularly for the writing and also it

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:45,120
made it more uniform for checking

00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:47,190
students answers J s math was created

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,370
then by David serve on it's a precursor

00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:52,260
to mass Jack's Jay s math was only

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,750
available on web work and on Moodle at

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,420
this time in 2002 that's where he

00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,959
started fine-tuning the stuff mathjax

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,980
now has taken over all mathematics

00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,050
presentation on the web as far as I can

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,360
tell I mean anything you see this

00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:10,480
typeset is

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,399
so and then open problem library was

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,769
born in called the national pride

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,690
a few later years later American

00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:19,149
Institute of mathematics sponsored us we

00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,769
had an outreach which we got a lot of

00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:23,769
people involved many of them are still

00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:25,329
involved and then in 2009 we got another

00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:30,639
grant joint with a mathematics

00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:32,730
Association of America to to disseminate

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:37,329
a dissemination grant over five years

00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:39,850
million plus dollars so we had about a

00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:42,160
hundred and fifty institutions in 2009

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:46,510
we wanted to get it up to 400 by the end

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,449
of the grant we reached it by 2011 and

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,010
at the moment there's again it's hard to

00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:52,720
tell because it's open source and not

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,279
everybody tells us stuff but we did a

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,709
Google search which showed that there

00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:59,529
were 776 institutions that were actively

00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:01,959
using it in one semester I couldn't find

00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:06,850
2009 but this is one of our early maps

00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:10,689
in 2011 2014 it looks like this it

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:12,939
covers the United States substantially

00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:15,459
penetrated Europe and still got a ways

00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:18,579
to go and finally at the end of this

00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:20,860
thing the AMS American mathematics

00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:27,059
Society ordered our name myself or

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:29,710
honored to receive an award for impact

00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:34,540
mathematics education and they said nice

00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:36,820
things about my work ok now I can start

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:40,950
telling me a little bit more and if

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,950
history tell you a little bit more about

00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,419
the web work itself and how it's put

00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:49,179
together it's it's divided into three

00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:51,220
parts there's a database which holds the

00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:53,590
information about from the students

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,059
about you know the answers that they put

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,790
in what their grades are and all that

00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:59,260
kind of stuff there's a front-end which

00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:02,020
is web work too which is basically

00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,700
what's called an LMS now content

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,340
management system Ordnung management

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,110
system and there's the backend which is

00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,410
the most unusual and special to

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:14,100
mathematics which is this PG render PG

00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,100
is the name for our

00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:21,029
DSL which which makes it easy to write

00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:23,159
mathematics and to check the answers the

00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:24,870
fact that it's open architecture like

00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,629
this has made it relatively easy to

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:31,080
change things for example math

00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:37,649
typesetting that was not at all trivial

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:40,080
in in 1995 tth was one of the things

00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:41,730
that we use first latex HTML which is

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,679
really meant for translating an entire

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:47,940
papers and latex into in the HTML we use

00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,789
but didn't work very well

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,559
DVI PNG is a nice little open-source

00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:55,980
thing that was made in Sweden and that

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,240
will change latex into pictures but on

00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,940
the other hand you can't rescale

00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,830
pictures and that's what drove David

00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,559
serve owned is a perfectionist to make

00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:07,409
mathjax or j/s math first and mathjax

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,110
later during all this time we produce

00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:12,570
PDF output so every one of those things

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:14,700
can be rendered either as HTML or as PDF

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,590
and that was something we inherited from

00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:21,179
CAPA and in the beginning this is

00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:22,889
absolutely necessary because complex

00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,750
formulas couldn't be read on the screen

00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:28,320
in the early days now they can't win

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:30,149
match acts but I still find this useful

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,860
educationally because for homework

00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:33,210
sometimes it's great to have it on the

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,230
screen but sometimes you'd like to be

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,529
and you carry it around with you

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,250
elsewhere and take a look at it on the

00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:40,559
back end

00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:45,779
again the database we started out using

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:48,210
gdb M of all things and eventually got

00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:51,750
to MySQL MySQL didn't exist when we

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:56,610
started even M SQL was not working very

00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:58,529
well on the back end were for the answer

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:01,409
evaluation this has gone through some

00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:03,629
changes also at the beginning we just

00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:05,909
used the parole evaluation function

00:20:03,629 --> 00:20:08,610
which of course meant that students got

00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:10,620
funny really interesting error messages

00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:13,379
from time to time straight from the Perl

00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,330
compiler we eventually put a little bit

00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,980
of a front end on that algebraic parser

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,379
which would check to see whether they

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,760
had syntax errors and then a day that

00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:26,200
came up with math objects which is

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,430
thing that we currently use so we knew

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,200
we were going to make mistakes from the

00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:31,120
beginning we knew this is an experiment

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,680
so we basically designed it so we could

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,820
keep rebuilding the thing as we were

00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,260
flying this is I think one of the best

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,870
compliments that we've ever received

00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,430
this is an or I think so computer aided

00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,260
assessment of mathematics by Chris

00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,510
senglin who knows what he's talking

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,640
about he's designed something similar

00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:52,060
called stack he's at university of

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,250
edinburgh these days but he recognized

00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,170
that because as the construction

00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,930
extensibility we were able to keep this

00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,370
thing going for 15 years now that's 2012

00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:04,450
we've been able to keep it going even

00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:08,770
longer um before I get to the demos let

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:11,470
me just show you a quick list of the

00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,910
kinds of answers that can be checked the

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,440
answer could be a complex number it

00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,780
could be a function it could be a

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,790
function with units uh sorry number with

00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,650
units it could be an anti derivative

00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,590
remember anti derivatives don't have

00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,150
unique answer it's only up to a constant

00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:30,340
true/false multiple choice and so on you

00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:32,050
can also solve OD E's ordinary

00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,030
differential equations and again that's

00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:37,180
up to solutions of the homogeneous

00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:43,330
equation baigan vectors all kinds of

00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:48,310
things with matrices and so on okay so

00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:49,660
now we get to the fun part where I where

00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:52,380
we see whether everything works and

00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,880
where I try to try to go fast enough

00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,390
okay so this is what happens when you

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,390
start again

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,530
all right so down here I have Pro

00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:11,140
Conference demo and you guys can reach

00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:15,400
this by going to that website and you

00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:16,660
can this thing and you can you can get a

00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,240
version of this which you can actually

00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:21,640
use and right on you enter its prof a

00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,360
and login prof a and you can do it all

00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,340
yourself so um yeah let me start first

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,929
there is a bunch of tools here on the

00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,059
left hand side this is part of that

00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:32,710
front-end but the main thing I want to

00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:37,740
show you is the library browser

00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,740
oh I'm sorry thank you

00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,860
okay

00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:54,559
thanks for helping on that so let's say

00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:57,730
I want to do calculus now let's do

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,730
single variable that's easier

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:07,159
differentiation product rule with trig

00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:08,539
functions you can see there's 41

00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:11,020
problems that match this that

00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:15,250
description

00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:18,650
takes a little while for them to come up

00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:20,510
here they are you can actually test them

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,970
in the library if you see one that you

00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:26,150
want you just click Add and up here at

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:32,049
the top you said where the you said

00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:32,049
where the problems are supposed to go

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:42,480
all right so let's go back to the

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:44,700
homework sets here there's a whole bunch

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,290
of them to look at I'm not going to be

00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,640
able to call it cover all of them but

00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:49,830
I've left them here for you to look at

00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,510
eventually one in particular you might

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,790
like is the interval interval

00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,260
progression which shows you successive

00:23:53,790 --> 00:24:01,290
versions about how we wrote that

00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:03,600
interval problem so I've entered the

00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:05,700
answers already so you can I don't have

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,140
to wait and watch me type this just

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:13,919
shows you that you can enter square

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:17,280
roots and it'll check it this one shows

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,540
that you can produce a graph so you're

00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,780
supposed to figure out points of

00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:24,059
continuity on this which is easy there's

00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,710
you know obviously this is discontinuous

00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:27,870
because there's a jump there but

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:29,820
students at this level are often trying

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,230
and you know focused on formulas and if

00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:35,549
something's given to them with our

00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:37,470
formula they get upset so we we give

00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:39,240
them problems with grass incidentally

00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,809
these graphs are different for each

00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,840
student

00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:48,809
and they're generated on a fly using gdb

00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:50,460
m and incidentally when you're looking

00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:52,110
at this at any time you can click show

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,480
source and it'll show you the source

00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:57,090
right underneath it you can also click

00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,240
the editor button at the bottom to see

00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:01,530
what the source looks like okay so this

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,650
is one where you have to find the

00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,650
derivative

00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:13,260
the antiderivative is more fun so I was

00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:17,280
gonna show that before you at the end

00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:19,110
here so we need an antiderivative

00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,429
general antiderivative is just a

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,950
function that when you differentiate it

00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:23,549
you get X to the fourth cosine of X to

00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:30,450
the fifth

00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:32,790
trust me this is an answer but of course

00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:37,320
there's more than one answer so for

00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:42,710
example if I add plus five to it then

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:48,200
that's also an answer and if you like me

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:48,200
if I were a student I would have said

00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:57,320
I would have entered that because sine

00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,260
squared plus cosine squared is always

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,850
equal to one which is a constant and

00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:03,830
then I prepared to get really mad at the

00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,610
instructor when the computer when it

00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:09,020
wouldn't accept my correct answer so

00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:11,570
everyone writes programs for themselves

00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,280
I wrote long that was handled in my

00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:17,360
earlier self remained even my current

00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:19,520
self here's another example of that the

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,830
we didn't have units at first but the

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,590
physicists definitely needed units so

00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:26,680
this is sides of the triangle the answer

00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,830
is square root of this thing in meters

00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:36,440
and that's the right answer

00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:38,630
but again you don't I mean I I make Jos

00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,130
about this but it seriously also you

00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,750
don't want the student thinking about

00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,160
well what does the computer want you

00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,930
want to think what's the answer to this

00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,970
problem of any correct answer should be

00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:49,880
accepted so if you put in a hundred

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:51,440
centimeters that should work too and if

00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:57,260
you remember the conversion to feet wide

00:26:51,440 --> 00:27:00,380
that'll work also furlongs I put for a

00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:02,600
long sent to just to be complete I don't

00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,560
think anyone's used it I had to look it

00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,560
up okay

00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:15,230
Cupid's yeah right there's well there's

00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:17,630
its extensible way on what everyone this

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,970
is this is actually taken from the

00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:21,890
original capper library a lot of the

00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,040
stuff got translated over by Frank

00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:27,200
Wolf's cuz he wanted those problems and

00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:29,630
he'd stopped using capital is using web

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,530
work that's before long Catholic

00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:36,650
actually got started let's see what else

00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:38,090
I've got for you this one I like I'm not

00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:40,880
gonna show you all the details of it

00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:43,750
this is what I call an Oracle function

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,920
which there's no formula for but if you

00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:48,050
give it an input it tells you what the

00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:50,060
output is and of course you're supposed

00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:51,590
to calculate the derivative and students

00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,090
they'll have a nice calculated

00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:55,190
derivative without if I don't know what

00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:58,030
the formula is well of course you use

00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:01,040
the approximation by slopes its quotient

00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:02,880
so that forces them to think about that

00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:07,130
a little bit

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,810
or ask their neighbor at least about it

00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:11,340
there's two of those and then the final

00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:15,360
thing here just to show you what the

00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:18,930
extensibility does the question is enter

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:23,400
a palindrome I don't think there's any

00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:25,110
other checker and that can do it but of

00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:29,310
course it's really easy to do with a

00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:31,440
computer and you know it's got a

00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,180
standard it's got two different kinds of

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,470
palindromes here and let me show you

00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:37,470
this source on this one

00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:39,480
okay so again load all the macros this

00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:43,290
is like tech and so on this is the thing

00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:46,020
that defines the PG language this is the

00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:48,060
text that gets printed out and then this

00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,670
is the little subroutine that text that

00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,580
checks it now this is a very early

00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:56,520
version of this the ones using math

00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:59,520
objects are much more sophisticated and

00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:02,490
what you do is there was one question

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,370
here you know one answer rule right here

00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:07,650
one answer blank and here's one checker

00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:09,270
right here and what this is is a little

00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,940
subroutine that takes the students

00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:13,860
answer compares them gives a zero or one

00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,850
and does the error checking they are

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,580
checking is the hard part

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:20,160
zero checking whether it's right is or

00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:23,810
not it's not hard checking whether what

00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,810
went wrong is much harder

00:29:34,070 --> 00:30:05,670
for hints okay yeah okay y'all okay

00:29:45,210 --> 00:30:08,630
let's let's do that yes yes so go the

00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,630
Oracle one okay

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:28,799
by the no and in fact so they're on this

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,330
this first example right here you could

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,830
go read the source code and figure out

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:35,490
that there's some JavaScript in there

00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:39,919
and figure out what the function was no

00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,919
what happened but

00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:52,470
but the second one approximate the

00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:54,570
function by cubic spline and the cubic

00:30:52,470 --> 00:31:02,309
spline is in JavaScript and as a student

00:30:54,570 --> 00:31:04,019
can figure that out of hire no they

00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:06,269
can't do that because this is all

00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:07,830
client-server type stuff and so the

00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:11,429
checking is all being done back on the

00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,539
backend yeah I shouldn't make Victor I

00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:14,730
can't I'm not gonna be able to make

00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:20,850
everything clear so please ask me

00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:22,950
questions later okay let's see okay I

00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:28,320
think that's it for that so let's go

00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:30,509
back to these guys and I'll try and go

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,399
through this quickly so the mathematics

00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:35,639
formulas are written in latex displayed

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:40,320
in HTML pages using mathjax they can

00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:42,059
also be presented as HTML page or PDF as

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,309
I showed you the question also defines

00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:47,039
this small pro program called an answer

00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:49,200
evaluator and it's this that gives you

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,110
the flexibility most people who think

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,789
about this kind of thing do it in kind

00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,169
of a declarative kind of language in

00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:56,970
which you just kind of fill in the data

00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:59,100
and everything is taken care of for you

00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:01,320
and unless you got a new program or

00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,960
y-you can't do much outside of the box

00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,240
that you've been put in with Perl we're

00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,399
using basically all of Perl so anything

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,399
that you can figure out an algorithm to

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,929
check with you can check with it now

00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:14,759
because we're running Perl and the safe

00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:17,129
compartment we've managed to make we've

00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:20,100
disabled things like print and remove

00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:21,570
the you know race to disk and things

00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:25,110
like that so they can't get into too

00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:27,059
much trouble okay so this I'm going to

00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:30,929
have to skip there's an original version

00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:33,720
here this is the problem this is the

00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:35,460
original problem which is kind of in raw

00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,970
Perl you can kind of see what it's doing

00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,740
but you won't have time but these slides

00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:45,119
are all up on the schedule and you can

00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:46,860
get at the you can get at the examples

00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,049
or you can go to the github and get it

00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:51,240
to get examples there there's a little

00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:54,990
tutorial in the wiki about how these

00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,580
things are rendered okay one of the best

00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,360
things we did was this clean split

00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,950
between

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,760
front and back ends and in allows you to

00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,410
improve things

00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,330
but it also means that you can just get

00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:08,790
rid of the front end and you can just

00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:10,920
use the back end that PG render which is

00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:12,690
the thing that's most unique so this

00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,130
allows interoperability with Moodle

00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,110
which we've been doing for a long time

00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:18,000
and now that the LTI has come along we

00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:20,040
can do it with canvas and blackboard and

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,220
I'll show you in a minute you can also

00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:25,860
in just embed it in HTML pages which

00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:28,320
will allow us to operate to interoperate

00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:32,660
with all of these oh we are texts Libre

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,660
Tech's pretext active calculus and so on

00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:37,280
so one more thing here

00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:52,869
so this is Moodle if I click on Moodle

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:55,639
it takes me to a WebWork problem

00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:59,090
automatic sign-on all that kind of stuff

00:33:55,639 --> 00:34:02,799
this is one that was created by that for

00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:04,970
the JMM join math meetings and Baltimore

00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,739
this shows you an example of a

00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:09,020
scaffolded problem in which you can't

00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:10,849
see I'm an instructor so I can see

00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,970
everything at once but a student has to

00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:15,679
do this thing first and then once they

00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:18,829
get that right they're able to look at

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:22,730
the second thing here and then they can

00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:24,559
look at the third thing so again this

00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,149
wasn't anything that existed at the

00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:27,799
beginning of this project this is

00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:29,599
actually two or three years in the

00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:37,520
making but it's kind of just finished

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:40,760
you know fairly recently okay more

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,230
interoperability so you don't even need

00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,700
Moodle in the front this is what the

00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:49,780
website looks like let's look at the

00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,780
embedded questions here

00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,260
okay yeah sorry they're right here I'm

00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:07,020
that sorry I had to go to them so this

00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:10,380
is this is just an iframe in our

00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:13,650
ordinary HTML page and it's got it's got

00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,329
a little jojoba applet running inside it

00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,130
which allows you to help the answer this

00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:20,480
question about what values of the

00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,480
interval will be equal to zero

00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:28,890
here is an example that allows you to do

00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:32,250
integration and so on topics of areas

00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:34,650
between curves I actually think I have a

00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:37,730
slightly better version of this thing

00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,730
set up for you in

00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,980
hands-on section this is the hands-on

00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:50,140
section where you can see these things

00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,030
and there's another example of this

00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:57,010
thing down here which I won't go into

00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:59,140
right at the moment okay so you can

00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,700
embed active questions and this is the

00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,030
text the people who are doing all they

00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,430
are they also want to do online homework

00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:09,400
they're trying to sell their books cheap

00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:11,080
we and myopenmath are in LAN capo

00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,450
perhaps are about the only choices that

00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:17,230
they have in terms of open source

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:18,970
everything else is proprietary but as

00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:23,500
you can just see you could embed this in

00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:25,750
the textbook I showed you quickly that

00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:28,300
it interoperates with geogebra the other

00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:30,270
link which I didn't get to shows you how

00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,590
it all operates interoperates with our

00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:35,320
for the people who are doing statistics

00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:37,420
that's quite recent and inner operates

00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:40,000
with sage math which is an open source

00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,800
mathematical look like which those of

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,970
you who do number theory would be what

00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:48,460
would be familiar with okay final part

00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:50,290
here oh the web work project was formed

00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,180
somewhat recently you can put an LLC

00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:54,670
after that as of three days ago

00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,260
we're actually official this is a

00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:58,950
support community that works on this

00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:02,110
thing it has a lot of the same kinds of

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:05,940
except that were newer to this stuff

00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:05,940
the same kinds of problems that Perl has

00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,120
we found that code camps these

00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,850
hackathons are the best way to get

00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,530
things done we've done a number of them

00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:17,590
over the years while we were getting NSS

00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:19,480
support so originally we had these

00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:21,490
outreach conferences and we just turned

00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,560
them into hackathons to make the code

00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:26,880
work better getting everybody together

00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:29,020
in one place made no amazing difference

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,460
here's a whole bunch of the people we

00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:36,070
gathered into the group in this project

00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,900
most recently you know the NSF has

00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:39,370
decided we're not experimental anymore

00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,520
after supporting us for twenty years

00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:44,890
which is fair so so we're trying to

00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,430
figure out ways to get the minimal

00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:47,960
amount of money that we need and

00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:51,230
hold it basically a couple of

00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:54,290
conferences a year or small-scale ones

00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:56,180
even so we want to emphasize that the

00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:58,040
impact has been substantial most

00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,930
educational innovations at the NSF

00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,940
affect only a school few schools

00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:03,829
sometimes only one Department they often

00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,200
die out after a year or two something

00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:11,119
like that we've lasted 23 years we've

00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,569
got at a minimum 776 places using it at

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,059
one time

00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:15,680
we built a coalition of a few dozen

00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:17,780
programmers contributing new features

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,710
and refining existing ones and I would

00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:24,109
really like to get more the math people

00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:26,119
have done a really good job with getting

00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:28,760
the thing going right for mathematics

00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,130
but they're not experts at Perl coding

00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,780
so I'm sure you can come along and say

00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,550
oh well it's good but we can do this

00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,910
better

00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:40,309
please that's exactly what we want the

00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:41,839
open problem library has an authorial

00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:45,020
workshop which is curating those

00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:46,250
problems over time I think that web work

00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:49,180
will actually produce the best possible

00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:51,859
collection of mathematics teaching tools

00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,630
because the it's being done by the

00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:56,950
teachers who really care about it and

00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,950
they're doing it for their own students

00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:03,760
this has to do a little bit with why I

00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,940
wanted to come talk to the Perl people

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,550
so and I have no choice but to quote

00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:11,770
myself I was interviewed in 2003 by

00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,960
McCallum about doing web work as a

00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:16,600
research mathematician but what that

00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:19,060
meant and whether that was the right

00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,590
thing to do so this is what I said and I

00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:24,460
never been able to say it better so I'll

00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:25,930
just quote myself so the point of it is

00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,030
that I mean I think that it was

00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:30,700
important that the mathematicians got in

00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,960
on this and kind of took the lead I'm

00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,880
pretty sure that an instructional

00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,500
technology group or even a pure

00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,940
programming group would have designed a

00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:41,050
system with the same set of strengths

00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:43,180
and weaknesses so I think that joining

00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:45,700
what we've done with things that you

00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:48,940
guys do we may be able to ameliorate

00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:52,450
some of those three so I'm trying to get

00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:54,460
people to join us you know all kinds of

00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,540
coding are useful but in fact just the

00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,880
fact that you have been an

00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:59,230
organizational people in your

00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,690
organization have been doing organizing

00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,550
and so on for far longer than we did we

00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,190
were just running NSF grants for a while

00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:08,320
we didn't have any ideas about forming a

00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:10,210
foundation or anything like that so we

00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,710
can use help on that on writing on

00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:13,510
documentation all the things that you

00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:17,590
need to do in Perl we need to do even

00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:22,330
more plus the coding we can definitely

00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:24,400
need to help with that too so a couple

00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:26,170
of specific projects we could integrate

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,820
decimals and on this as well that's

00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:32,980
another thing like geogebra I've never

00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:35,140
quite figured out or found the time to

00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,600
figure out how to make a CTN module for

00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:39,100
pg but I think I could with a little bit

00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,970
of work we could separate the modules

00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:44,890
out and put pgup separately on CPM not

00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:47,440
sure the we could do that with a

00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:49,150
front-end but we could try the project

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,430
I'm most involved in right at the moment

00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:56,500
it is getting everything localization

00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:58,500
making it work with utf-8 and so it

00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:02,020
supports Hebrew Chinese French and so on

00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,230
Technion we've got a user there that's a

00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:06,940
big

00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:08,890
the famous University and Israel has

00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,450
taken it over they they had their own

00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:13,030
version of this kind of thing that

00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:14,470
worked in Hebrew the guy there looked at

00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,510
it and said it was written in Java he

00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,920
says well if we upgrade this thing and

00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,660
he finally decided that it would be

00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,350
easier to teach web work Hebrew than it

00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:25,660
would be to fix their Java and we'd

00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:27,850
already started on that and so that's

00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:30,190
it's working now as we speak it's being

00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:32,050
used there and it's slowly rolling out

00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:34,869
to Chinese and French and so on and so

00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:38,260
forth what feature would you guys like

00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:41,050
to add I went to this Perl 6 talk you

00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,430
know the workshop there are all kinds of

00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:46,030
things in for all six that would make

00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:47,530
this thing kind of neat one has to be a

00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:50,470
little bit cautious about that because

00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:52,869
rolling Perl 6 out to the 770

00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:56,410
institutions using it why take a couple

00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:58,510
of years so but certainly ideas like

00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:00,130
that and it turns out there's all kinds

00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:04,000
of things in Pro 5 that I didn't know

00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:06,110
existed as I learned this morning so

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:13,819
thank you

00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:39,780
[Applause]

00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:41,490
Westen's yes yes so the question is do

00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,819
different schools use different

00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:46,170
databases and does that cause a problem

00:42:43,819 --> 00:42:51,450
that particularly hasn't caused a

00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:54,180
problem it is it's mostly been used with

00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:58,220
MySQL I know at least one school this

00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:00,030
trying to adapt it to post sequel sorry

00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:04,619
Postgres I'm sorry that's what I meant

00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:06,390
yeah and and it was designed Sam

00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:08,490
Hathaway designed it so that it was

00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:10,380
agnostic and so that we could hook it up

00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:12,089
to a bunch of databases but until you

00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:16,730
actually have it working on two or three

00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:19,650
databases that's not completely agnostic

00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:21,599
yes and so that's been one of the

00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:23,220
biggest growth the growth industry right

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,980
now is high schools and community

00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:27,930
colleges surprisingly enough it's a

00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,430
little bit harder to write problems for

00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:32,010
high schools than it is for calculus

00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:34,200
partially because you actually you know

00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:36,270
when you want the answer like factor a

00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,460
polynomial you actually want it in a

00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:39,809
specific form and where work was

00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,609
originally designed so than anything

00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:44,309
that was mathematically correct would be

00:43:41,609 --> 00:43:46,049
okay so how are we solved that are

00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:47,819
people at Portland Community College

00:43:46,049 --> 00:43:49,290
we've got some one guy out there who's

00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:51,690
been doing a lot of work on this thing

00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:53,280
and surprisingly High School's worse

00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:55,049
there were a few high schools that were

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,839
early adopters and now there's a lot

00:43:55,049 --> 00:44:01,020
more coming along that is actually one

00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:04,670
of the growth things that's also why we

00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:08,099
need more and better documentation and

00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:09,839
and simplification I think we've got it

00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:12,119
pretty well nailed about making it

00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,859
simple for students to answer the

00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:15,359
questions and for the computer to stay

00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:18,569
out of their way and doing their

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,569
mathematics but the ability for this the

00:44:18,569 --> 00:44:23,369
instructor to write their own problem

00:44:20,569 --> 00:44:24,330
could still use some work now most of

00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,740
them

00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:28,750
pick the problems from the library and

00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:31,270
in many cases they don't even do that

00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:32,620
some supervisor and the Community

00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:34,540
College does it for them and then

00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:37,090
they're given these problems but I'm a

00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:38,590
big believer and each instructor really

00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:40,600
should have a lot of control over what

00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:44,260
they've done and at least make it

00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:46,000
possible so that it's possible now

00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,980
actually they make small modifications

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,830
easily but it still looks scary because

00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:55,240
it does look like pearl well looks like

00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:58,330
programming anything but help with that

00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:01,780
would be would also be important what

00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:04,120
we've got is something that problems

00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:08,770
easy problems are relatively easy by our

00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:12,370
standards hard problems can be done

00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:15,010
which is what's the important thing what

00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:17,380
could be done is you could add say a

00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:19,480
JavaScript front-end to this whole thing

00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,940
that really is declarative and so if

00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,920
somebody wants a new problem it's you

00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,900
know of a very standard type they just

00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,820
fill in a bunch of variables and maybe a

00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:30,580
function or something like that and then

00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:32,230
the Mac gets translated into PG and

00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,940
works from there there have been a

00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:39,730
couple of attempts to do that but no

00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:42,040
one's really followed through but that's

00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:43,900
not it's not that hard to do people have

00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,810
come close to it the problem is is that

00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:48,340
by the time somebody really wants it by

00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,900
the time they figured out how to start

00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,490
doing that they already understand the

00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:56,140
Perl stuff so well that they don't want

00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:58,360
it same thing with Python I had you know

00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:02,560
just write it in Python can't we write

00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,550
in Python and by within a little while

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,300
he didn't care anymore

00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:06,300
yes

00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:15,820
did it did they ever have terminal

00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:18,910
support no and the very early so WebWork

00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:22,869
one which was on running on Pearl four

00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:25,090
on on CGI rubber - is a mod Perl type

00:46:22,869 --> 00:46:28,330
installation and web work three I hope

00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:31,660
will be a Perl dancer but or something

00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:34,060
whatever else the newest thing the

00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:36,970
students never teletype tin the

00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:39,130
instructors however did so in the early

00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:40,690
days if he wanted to modify a problem or

00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:42,130
set up a problem set or something like

00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:47,860
that you had to have command line access

00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:49,930
to the web server and and and do all

00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,900
that stuff yourself part of the stuff

00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:54,820
that Rob was involved in was changing

00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:58,000
that so that the instructor interface

00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:59,680
was also on the web and you could add

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,300
classless add students to the class

00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,490
assigned students to different homework

00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:08,310
sets create homework sets actually all

00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:08,310
of that's Rob's work yes

00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:21,710
so you need to access to for example

00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,079
the complimentary error function or

00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,360
something weird like that you can't get

00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:29,180
that

00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:31,370
um well so alright so when we started

00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:33,040
this thing we said everyone said oh how

00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:34,240
are you going to do this thing without a

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,770
computer

00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,290
CAS you know computer algebra system

00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:42,920
that includes Chris sanguine who thought

00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:43,520
that was essential and we said well all

00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,200
right

00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,580
pearl you know we'll hook it in when we

00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:51,230
need to CRISPR all could hook in

00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:53,210
anything so and then we basically never

00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:54,830
found a need for that including what

00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:57,140
you're mentioning I think we had all

00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,400
that statistic stuff worth and an

00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,110
enormous amount of that stuff was

00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,980
already on Sipan and what wasn't on

00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:06,620
Sipan we wrote basically and you know

00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:08,090
huge matrix minute well not huge because

00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,250
this is these are homework problems I

00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:11,480
don't have to do industrial-strength

00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:14,810
matrix inversion and things like that

00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,740
but you know 3x3 5x5 matrices Perl does

00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:19,420
that just fine

00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:23,390
and so we succeeded very well with that

00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:25,820
we have hooked it in to Sage math and I

00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:27,740
found that useful because even though

00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,780
you could write it in Perl Y you could

00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,250
you know the modular arithmetic and

00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,770
things like that or a little bit easier

00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:35,120
in sage on the other hand there's at

00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:37,070
least one guy who just doesn't like

00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:39,890
being attached to sage and he's

00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:42,020
rewriting all the problems but I didn't

00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:44,390
so on using sage he's figuring out how

00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:47,510
to use it with Sipan and custom modules

00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:50,570
it's amazing how much mathematics stuff

00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:52,610
you can do with just straight Perl or at

00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:54,170
least I was I was impressed and other

00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:59,420
people when you explained it to them

00:48:54,170 --> 00:49:02,590
carefully or even more impressed well

00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,590
the questions yes sir

00:49:10,269 --> 00:49:16,489
yes so this was a very important part

00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:20,089
Portland Community College which I

00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:23,079
mentioned earlier has I all schools but

00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:28,309
is particularly big on disability and

00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:30,470
it's last question here so we have it's

00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:32,119
on it's on our website you can kind of

00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,900
on our wiki page search for

00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:35,210
accessibility

00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:38,180
we got glowing recommendation from them

00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:40,549
way above WebAssign and and Pearson's

00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,650
MyMathLab and various things like that a

00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:45,890
lot of that is due to the fact that we

00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:49,160
use mass Jack's and David serve own and

00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:51,440
his team on doing that are very

00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,150
interested in accessibility every new

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:57,190
version of math decks that comes out is

00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:59,869
more accessible than the last and

00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:01,970
individual problems might not be

00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:04,430
accessible because the instructor the

00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:06,499
guy who put the pictures in the page

00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:07,970
forgot to add alt tax and so on that's

00:50:06,499 --> 00:50:12,259
one of the things we try and catch when

00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:13,759
we do the editing for the library I'm

00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:16,029
afraid that's last question in public

00:50:13,759 --> 00:50:19,069
but I will be glad to I'll be around

00:50:16,029 --> 00:50:21,470
through Thursday and I'll be glad to

00:50:19,069 --> 00:50:24,529
answer questions I have cards if you

00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:25,570
need that happy to talk to you thanks

00:50:24,529 --> 00:50:33,329
very much for your attention

00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:33,329
