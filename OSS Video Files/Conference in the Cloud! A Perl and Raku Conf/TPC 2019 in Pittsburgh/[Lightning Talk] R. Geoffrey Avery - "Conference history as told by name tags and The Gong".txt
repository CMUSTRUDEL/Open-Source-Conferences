Title: [Lightning Talk] R. Geoffrey Avery - "Conference history as told by name tags and The Gong"
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	I never wear the current YAPC/TPC name tag at the current conference.  I have a dozen pairs of old name tags and switch several times a day.  We will remember the past with a trip through the tags.  And along the way I will share a few stories about The Gong, which even traveled on its own.

I did bring the timer myself so I'm

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,269
going to talk about a couple of things

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,179
first nametags throughout the history of

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,809
the conference and some of the travels

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:18,359
that the gong has had so we started in

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,340
Pittsburgh and then in Pittsburgh and I

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,830
don't have those name tags but I was

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,990
there and that second year London

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,090
started so Europe started theirs which I

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,250
didn't make it to the next year we went

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,800
to Montreal and it moved to Amsterdam I

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,059
didn't get to Amsterdam but and I don't

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,309
have the tag from Montreal however

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:43,680
starting in 2002 I have st. Louis and I

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:46,829
have Belfast actually not Belfast munich

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,950
munich was 2002 I wasn't doing the

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:53,309
Lightning talks yet in 2003 in Boca

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,899
Raton I started and I used the song that

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,420
Dominus had borrowed from someone here

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,760
at Pittsburgh that was this big and very

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,920
hard to get anywhere because even if you

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,780
carry the huge suitcase that's still

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,040
technically size legal under a plane

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,130
there's no way you can stay under the

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:13,260
weight modern weight limit so I used

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,580
that one there and then in Paris I

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,200
didn't do the lightning talks and I

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:22,350
don't have the tag the next year was

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,880
Buffalo where I didn't do the lightning

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,369
talks there but I did start doing them

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,119
for Ã¶zkan and I don't have that tag and

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,439
then in the fall in Belfast I couldn't

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,030
take the big one so I went out and

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,670
bought the new travel Gong which does

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,920
fit better under a plane it has a piece

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,990
of paper normal size that travels with

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,990
it when I put it under the plane it says

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,840
dear TSA you are probably looking for

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,860
the 12 inch Gong it isn't a black Aslan

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,110
bag on top thanks Jeff and that has

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,590
picked up several lol's and thanks

00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,970
and when I get to the destination I find

00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,860
the piece of paper in there that says

00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,930
we're the TSA we've been in your bag and

00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:09,479
nothing below that level has been

00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:16,600
disturbed 2005 we were in Toronto and

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:19,710
then Braga in northern Portugal 2006 we

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:27,540
went to Chicago the first time and

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:34,590
Birmingham in England 2007 we went to

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:38,560
Austin Houston Houston and then Vienna

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:49,320
2008 we were back in Chicago and then

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:52,450
Copenhagen 2009 I don't have our 2009

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,840
which Pittsburgh which I have this place

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:58,390
but we went to Lisbon also in Portugal

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:04,630
that year and this is their edge which

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:06,940
is huge which unfolds Bigley the back is

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:11,100
empty but it has among other things a

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:13,900
map of satellite map of the venue the

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,780
subway system directions to the party

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,130
for the big night and some translations

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,100
including a few that are no longer

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:26,860
conduct safe like do you have a sister

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:29,640
so don't look to the Past always for

00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,640
better ways to do things

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:48,860
Columbus and Pisa

00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:52,080
I got it

00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:58,650
Asheville and Riga where it's going to

00:03:52,080 --> 00:04:03,200
be back in two months Madison I don't

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:08,090

it was in Orlando on our side also we've

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:31,530
got this year's nineteen oh that's not

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,850
one of these whoops

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:40,490
it's that was the Baltimore Pro workshop

00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:47,430
last year in Salt Lake and last year in

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:53,040
Glasgow and Alexandria and Amsterdam in

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:56,040
16 and one more thing about the Gong in

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,590
12 I didn't make it to Frankfort I was

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,360
supposed to do it in a task on out in

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,130
Portland but I couldn't make it there

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,770
either but I'd already had a hotel room

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,810
reserved so I mailed the gong to the

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,790
hotel and arranged for Jim to take my

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,710
place and sent postage stamps so it

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:14,760
could come back in the if it fits it

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:17,580
ships box but he said Jeff will be in

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,590
Frankfort I'll just send it on ahead so

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,660
he gave it to Abigail who took at the

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,850
Frankfort who gave it to Leon from

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,670
London who does there's their workshop

00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,840
and he ran it and then he said it's got

00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,660
to get back to the US so he gave it to

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,270
schlern who took it back to Portland who

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,700
held it until March and then finally

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,490
mailed it home to me 15,000 miles and 12

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,910
to 24 time zone boundaries later the

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,860
gong found its way home unfortunately

00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:46,080
while it was missing I had a small Linux

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,669
thing that I needed lightning talks for

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,120
and I didn't have the gong so I used a

00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:50,120
vuvuzela

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,440
and that are my memories

00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,010
