Title: [Lightning Talk] R. Geoffrey Avery - "Conference history as told by name tags and The Gong"
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	I never wear the current YAPC/TPC name tag at the current conference.  I have a dozen pairs of old name tags and switch several times a day.  We will remember the past with a trip through the tags.  And along the way I will share a few stories about The Gong, which even traveled on its own.
