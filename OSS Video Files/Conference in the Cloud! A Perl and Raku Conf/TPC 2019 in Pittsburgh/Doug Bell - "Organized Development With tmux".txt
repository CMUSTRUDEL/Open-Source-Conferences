Title: Doug Bell - "Organized Development With tmux"
Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	Tmux is a terminal multiplexer which allows you to open multiple shells in a single terminal, split your window into panes, and detach from your terminal to resume your work later! Using Tmux can help keep track of everything you're working on and quickly switch tasks to pick up where you left off!
This talk will introduce the basics of Tmux, how to manage windows and split them into panes, how to configure Tmux, and how to organize and automate Tmux layouts for your projects to get to developing as quickly as possible.
Doug Bell lives on a command-line and does all his development there. With the knowledge from this talk, you can add the features of an IDE to your terminal.
