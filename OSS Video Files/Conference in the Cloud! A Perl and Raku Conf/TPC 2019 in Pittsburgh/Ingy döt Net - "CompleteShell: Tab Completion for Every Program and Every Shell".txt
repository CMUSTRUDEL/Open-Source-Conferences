Title: Ingy dÃ¶t Net - "CompleteShell: Tab Completion for Every Program and Every Shell"
Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	ab completion is one of those programming things that gets added after the fact. You write a cool tool, it gains popularity and then someone wants tab completion. If you take the time to learn how to do it, you write a mediocre completion setup for Bash. Then people want you to support Zsh and Fish and maybe others. Each shell has its own way of doing things.

Wouldn't it be cool if you could easily define how your commands complete, and then all the tab completion code was generated for you? Wouldn't it be cool if Bash completion did some of the more modern things that Zsh and Fish do?

**CompleteShell** is your new friend. It's a simple DSL for defining command completion that will compile to any shell. The DSL allows you to access a Standard Library of common useful shell code to create completions. It also allows you to write your own function plugins that (in any language including Perl).

CompleteShell takes Bash completion to places you never been before. For example, with Zsh or Fish, every completion has a description. Now Bash can do that too.

Ingy will show you this cool new tool, how to use it, how to author completions, and how to create a completely completable world!

um hey everybody I'm inky and I'm gonna

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,620
give a talk about tab-completion for

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,219
every program in every show I call it

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,429
complete shell so what is tab-completion

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,170
for those who don't know it's basically

00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:18,869
context-sensitive help when you're

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,910
typing in text you just press the tab

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:21,390
key and it's supposed to do what you

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,529
want

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,619
so gmail has tab completion now let's

00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:30,630
take a look so let's say we're writing a

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,739
message to Larry while an email and I

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,320
say hi oof so it gave me a suggestion

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,600
you know and so I just hit tab except

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,550
that one

00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:51,649
and I say like how yeah that sounds good

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:51,649
go with the tab sounds good

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:17,010
yeah sure and then oh I forgot a subject

00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:33,170
here let's uh oh yeah cool I think I'll

00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:33,170
hit sands what do you think cool okay so

00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:46,500
maybe we'll have spam for lunch see so a

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,680
lot of people use tab-completion for

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,240
minimal stuff like a file completion at

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,750
the terminal so if we were to say like

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,160
LS /she I hit tab at stamp and then I

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,110
hit tab a couple times and I get all

00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,289
these things and let's see what's in

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,330
snap oops

00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:05,789
so you notice when I hit tab it said

00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:10,619
more so I have a pager here it's because

00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:13,620
the font is so big so tab-completion

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:17,100
kind of sucks on bash if it goes off the

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,520
screen but let's go ahead and now that

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,790
it's there's nothing in there but you

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,790
get the idea

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,709
but good tab-completion actually gives

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,020
the best info at any point in a command

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:35,069
so it doesn't always have to be a file

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,380
name or path let's take a look at one

00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:41,880
that I just became aware of a month or

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:45,810
so ago Perl and so so if you type in

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,580
Perl minus m and hit tab okay

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,760
it's just gonna list all the modules

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,400
installed on my system so let's see say

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,050
yes okay now I have this Patriot says

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,260
more at the bottom but it's not actually

00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:01,739
more it's built it's the red line pager

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,050
built in to bash and absolutely sucks it

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,520
only goes forward or you can quit it

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,130
that's all you can do you can spacebar

00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:13,040
forward or Q to quit so if you type in

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:15,480
something like I lost CGI

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,240
okay so then it's less and you can say

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,790
oh I just wanted to see GI pretty and a

00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,070
tab complete school alright this is

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,740
going to come up over and over again

00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:26,700
throughout the talk the purl one so

00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:36,770
could everybody see the bottom of the

00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:36,770
screen there okay that's true

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,710
I'll try to remember to clear the screen

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:57,270
we're often okay

00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:58,830
so it's it's it's my opinion that all

00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,090
good command-line programs should have

00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,990
tab completion and they should have man

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,550
pages we get a lot of new stuff these

00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,410
days that doesn't have man pages in

00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,360
other languages all the Perl stuff does

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,209
and that's good but none of the Perl

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,730
stuff really has tab completion Perl

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:18,540
itself does because it's provided in

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,400
bash completion and in other shells

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,530
completions but other than that Perl

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,340
dock and those kind of things generally

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,650
been left out so how do you make tab

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,910
completions for your commands so the

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,919
thing is that almost nobody writes

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,840
completions for their C lies and who's

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,440
published a a sea pan module that

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:41,870
installs a module been direct thing and

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,870
did you do tab completion for those bins

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:47,250
right so somebody contribute and it

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,560
ships one for what shell for bash right

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,270
so the deal is you really need a

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,650
community because nobody who's gonna

00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,600
actually write a bin command is going to

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,070
take the time to learn these other

00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,940
subsystems for shells they don't even

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,940
use but if you have a popular command

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,320
somebody I'll contribute it eventually

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:09,180
it's pretty hard to do this stuff the

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,130
bash stuff is really nasty Zed shell

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,419
 Esha I used the Canadian

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,680
pronunciation because I learned about it

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:17,370
when I was living up in active state

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,540
Vancouver sea shell and fish were kind

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,020
of built around better tab-completion

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,220
actual easy shell really was and it does

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,300
have some nice features for tab

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,550
completion I'll show you those in a

00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,830
second fish actually just wanted to

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,350
rewrite the whole shell language

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,860
including tab completion but some people

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:38,070
of that and ksh just barely works at all

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,450
in fact well let's let's actually try

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:44,930
the Perl command and all those cells

00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:48,870
real quick so if I say pearl - M okay

00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:51,180
gave me for I don't oh okay there's some

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:54,770
more okay and I can go through these I

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,770
guess I could let's see

00:05:55,159 --> 00:06:03,009
okay so as I went back it wasn't really

00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:03,009
responsive in that if I type in I'll go

00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:10,879
okay so it goes through those things

00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:15,949
it's not bad let's look at a seashell so

00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:17,569
we do pearl - M okay so now this is

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:21,019
giving us a long list and let's see if

00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:22,249
we can hit tab for more okay I'm going

00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:31,669
through the whole thing this is not any

00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:35,259
good I mean if I take on CGI okay and

00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:40,459
then can i tab okay that's not too bad

00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:44,899
and let's do a good old what we already

00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:48,979
did bash let's try Kate okay sure so you

00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:52,669
have to say set - Oh II max it really I

00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:54,729
just learned this this morning and then

00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:57,289
you don't hit tab you hit double escape

00:06:54,729 --> 00:07:03,699
and it only works for things like LS

00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:06,769
slash temp wait you might I'm not my in

00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:08,599
yes okay it does work for tab I'm sorry

00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:09,709
so the tab actually works and it gives

00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:12,529
you all these numbered things I don't

00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,979
know if I can type in 23 I can't type in

00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:19,909
anything

00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:21,050
well maybe I can G max okay so it has

00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:22,129
some kind of tab completion that's good

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,889
to know

00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:27,469
I haven't actually delved into the the

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:31,639
cases beyond this but I will

00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:35,029
so let me introduce complete shell to

00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:39,589
you so anybody who's on IRC I encourage

00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:42,050
you to on the freenode dotnet server to

00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:44,149
join the pound complete shell this will

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,379
come in useful if you have a and if you

00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:46,610
have a laptop this is going to be an

00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:51,129
interactive thing we're gonna get you

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:54,740
all going with complete show if I can

00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:56,899
okay I'm just gonna check the IRC

00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,309
channel see if all right nobody's joined

00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:00,309
cool you guys all suck

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:12,360
just a hex right uh-huh okay so complete

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,680
shell is a it's a really simple data DSL

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,920
so you just define all the data parts

00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,280
that can be gleaned to make a completion

00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:24,070
in any language it compiles that DSL

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:30,400
into native bash CHS and fish

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:33,280
completions and it has a CLI to manage

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,800
the billions of completions that people

00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,900
have written which is it's all lies but

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,940
this is how it's supposed to be this is

00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,490
talking in the future this will be true

00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,490
in ten years right it's really easy to

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,350
write and publish your own completions

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:50,050
and it makes bash completionist we'll

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:54,400
see actually I'd like to say on par

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:56,500
better than see this the zishe man just

00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,160
walked in so android gran guard ladies

00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,930
and gentlemen I think it's better for

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,870
the sea pan command you'll see then than

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,470
what you just saw in either Z sir or

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:15,840
orifice I was saying Zed shell so it

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:15,840
says edge Scelzi shell and zishe okay

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,580
yeah so basically I want to make the

00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,590
best completion out there I want to make

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,450
completion better in general I want to

00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,710
make it really I want to make it for

00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,060
every command that doesn't have

00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,570
completion in every command that has

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,490
shitty completion and make it possible

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,410
in it every cell and so it just seemed

00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,330
like a problem that wasn't solved and it

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:41,320
seemed like a solvable problem so I

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:44,350
decided to solve it I'm going to show

00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,550
you when you get this installed here's

00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,990
what you'll get you'll get a a a command

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:54,280
so if you run the command you just get

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:57,550
the help or if you run it with help you

00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,050
get the help the same thing if you run

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,020
it with the help command you'll get the

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,270
man page it's just the full

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,390
documentation for it and of course you

00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:10,570
get the same man because every good

00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:14,769
command has a man page and completion as

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:18,939
listen if you search for the term

00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:20,800
CP you'll get Sipan Sipan MC pan CPM and

00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:27,339
C pan upload most of which were written

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:28,660
last night and if you look for pearl

00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:30,670
these are all the pearls stuff I have

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:34,470
right now at the billions right but

00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:38,290
we're gonna get there yeah I wrote

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:43,629
diesel and actually the Pearl one this

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:44,980
morning at 5 a.m. this is the list of

00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:47,649
the ones that are installed so since I

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:51,089
have complete shell installed it

00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:55,379
installs the complete shell completion

00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:57,489
and here I'll install the Sipan m1 okay

00:10:55,379 --> 00:11:02,350
and there's a bug that when I do this

00:10:57,489 --> 00:11:05,769
from the terminal it picks up the wrong

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:08,949
information but and if I didn't want to

00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:14,230
install all the pearl ones I can do that

00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:16,420
so I'm gonna kill that hmm it's

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:18,549
configurable and here's what the config

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,929
looks like out of the box everything's

00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:24,579
turned off but you can turn on a single

00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:26,499
setting like this so in bash you know

00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:29,470
how you have to tab tab to get

00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:31,629
completion well you can use single tab

00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,369
and I make that just a config option so

00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:35,319
that you only have to hit tab once and

00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:38,619
so if we do that then we look at the

00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:41,589
config and now single tab is true and

00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:44,439
the others are unset and so they default

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:45,999
to false but here's the cool one modern

00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:48,759
settings if I set modern settings to

00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:50,709
true then it turns on all these

00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:52,509
goodnesses that you really want that I

00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:55,600
think you really want so and you can

00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:58,720
turn those off again if you want we'll

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,929
see how those work in just a minute but

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,309
first I want to introduce a company

00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,499
called zip recruiter that I happen to

00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:08,799
work for I started there last summer and

00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:10,360
I just want to mention it because and I

00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:14,470
hope that you can agree Andrew even

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:17,559
Andrew left recently but that it's a

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,779
pretty special place and how many zip

00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:22,059
recruiter people are in the audience so

00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:24,250
we got take a look at these guys so it's

00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:27,960
got bad

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:33,010
can't even see that fire it's true and

00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:34,660
sterling and so it's located in Santa

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,790
Monica and no matter what you think

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,340
about la when you take a trip down there

00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,750
it's pretty awesome for a week I mean I

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,430
like to get out of there but I really

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,680
love being there for a week it's pretty

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,780
great place and I'm remote I live in

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,360
Seattle and so a lot of the Perl

00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,320
programmers are remote the original code

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,180
base was written in Perl

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,310
and so we hire a lot of Perl people but

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,390
we're also moving in a lot of language

00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,150
directions I'd say there's probably

00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,570
eight to ten languages in use and Python

00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,520
and goer

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,960
so if you're kind of a Perl programmers

00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,030
thinks maybe you're hitting the end of

00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,750
your life with Perl and you want to go

00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:10,420
to a great company and a code Perl and

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,430
maybe learn a new language and maybe

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,190
zips for you so talk to me or us if

00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:17,080
you're interested and I just I wrote

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,130
that note I'm not actually zip is paying

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,110
for this conference because there's such

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,790
a cool company for me this is the first

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,950
Yap see that I've ever been paid to go

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,030
to but they didn't ask me to say that

00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,860
and I don't have to do anything for them

00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,880
it's just I'm just here to do whatever I

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,930
want and that's what I'm doing and I

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,520
just wanted to say that so when I

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,730
started at zip recruiter I noticed that

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,860
there was hundreds of bin commands that

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:42,340
people had written just small to large

00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:44,050
to medium things and I also noticed that

00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:47,500
none of them had tab completion or main

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:50,980
pages so one day mjd is one of my

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,570
teammates it just so happens and he kind

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,940
of put a thing out he had written a new

00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,410
bin thing and he's that everybody was

00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,640
using and he's like could somebody do

00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,500
bash completion for this and I'm like

00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,760
I'll do it and I'm like but I'm not

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,879
gonna just do it for that I'm gonna do

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,220
it for everything

00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,689
and then I'm gonna open source it so we

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,379
can do it for the entire world and it's

00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:12,279
gonna be awesome

00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:14,920
and that's why I'm here and I also self

00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:16,689
the man page thing I made wiki pages

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,290
turn into my own pages and as that's

00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:22,600
pretty cool we have an internal wiki so

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,220
even if you don't know how to make a man

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,990
page you know to make up wiki page it

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:30,879
just becomes a man page okay so this is

00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,220
where I want to get interactive I want

00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:38,860
you guys to go to let's see if anybody's

00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:45,490
doing the IRC Channel oh yeah punch what

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:48,069
up whatever anyway go to github.com

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,809
slash complete shell slash complete show

00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:51,639
so complete shells the org because I

00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:53,050
have a bunch of repos every completion

00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:57,429
as a repo and then the complete shell

00:14:53,050 --> 00:15:04,300
repo itself is the main software and

00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:09,429
then so I'm gonna click on that now and

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:12,519
then I'm gonna go to the wiki and then

00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:18,730
I'm gonna go to this little tcp/ip thing

00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:21,639
I wrote it 6:00 in the morning okay

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,019
and so if you want to play along these

00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:25,889
are all the steps that you need to do

00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:28,089
and you need to do this in bash because

00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:29,170
the other cells just aren't quite

00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:30,610
working I've actually looked at the

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,399
shells and I know they'll work but the

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,449
work just isn't quite done yet so if you

00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,059
could start up a bash shell and run

00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:40,990
those things please feel free also I

00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:43,269
forgot to mention you can drop problems

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,350
in the IRC channel you could bring them

00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:49,059
up to me but I probably won't have time

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:52,179
to get into them or you can file bugs as

00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:55,209
issues on that in this repo and I'd

00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:56,920
appreciate it if you did that anyway

00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:58,929
let's actually I'm gonna actually run

00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:03,220
all these commands here at the terminal

00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:06,459
so I'm going to grab that first one I'm

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,829
gonna go back and I was like planning to

00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:12,959
do this

00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:24,249
what's that awesome

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:26,579
file open okay well let's see so I'm

00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,579
going to say

00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,920
and actually

00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,390
okay I'm going to delete it so we're

00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,390
starting from scratch

00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:52,970
okay and then to actually enable this

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:55,790
thing um just to just enable it in the

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,100
shell all I have to do is source the dot

00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,650
complete shell dot RC file and then I

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,300
would just put that line into my bash RC

00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:05,780
if I wanted to have that all the time

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:11,630
and so now I have the complete shell

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:14,360
command with completion okay and those

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,490
are all the sub commands that we saw and

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:21,970
so we'll run like config and so that tab

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,970
completes obviously and we get that now

00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:33,020
I'm gonna I don't type so good so I'm

00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:34,730
gonna make an alias alias CS equals just

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,220
see that doesn't even tab complete it's

00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:40,660
terrible

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,660
and then I can say

00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,400
that tab completes because it's mine yes

00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:55,309
and so now I have a CS command and I can

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,100
say CS config and it to have completes

00:17:55,309 --> 00:18:02,809
and everything the next thing I want to

00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:07,450
do is to turn on the modern settings so

00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:10,910
if I say see us play hit tab I get this

00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:13,640
and I had to hit tab twice watch what

00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:17,419
happens if I do if I hit config modern

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:20,120
settings true now he hit CS I hit tab

00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:21,740
once and I get all the commands with all

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,440
there the descriptions which is much

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:30,010
nicer and if I type in I n I would get

00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,010
installer in it I want to install cPanel

00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,360
yeah it's just the order actually I made

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:43,430
the index on the order I wanted them to

00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:44,900
show so I might change but it's so small

00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,630
right now I kind of wanted to keep the

00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,809
Sipan things together and yeah that kind

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,809
of thing

00:18:51,160 --> 00:19:01,610
okay so now we have C Pan Am and if I

00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:06,370
hit tab what happens okay so this is the

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:06,370
other thing that you need to do is to

00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:12,860
install FCF who's used the fuzzy finder

00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:14,630
here so a lot of people have used it I'm

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,040
only using it not in the sense that

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,170
you've used it but it's actually a pager

00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,480
selector that works really nice and I'm

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:23,420
replacing olive bashas completion for

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,370
large sets with fuzzy finder and it

00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:30,110
works out really great so I'm going to

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:33,559
move slash temp I actually moved it out

00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:37,520
of the way so I get this message because

00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:41,480
you'll probably get it and I'm going to

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:47,059
move it too and let's see what happens

00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:49,420
now okay so now I have in Tecton let's

00:19:47,059 --> 00:20:00,980
look for all the yeah Moe modules okay

00:19:49,420 --> 00:20:03,760
double colon yeah double colon oh okay

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:08,420
could do that one

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:10,220
so I tab completed that let's do that

00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,500
well type in JSON first and then hit

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,630
here let me clear it JSON first and then

00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,550
I hit tab so it automatically goes and

00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:22,309
does all the JSON modules I could keep

00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:23,809
taking in here and watch I gotta hit

00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:27,530
spacebar a bunch of times let's get

00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:29,559
those 20 modules hit enter okay looking

00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,559
good

00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:38,100
let's do let's see more some CGI stuff

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,530
okay and then I want to I'll get these

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,690
oh I didn't really want the soil hit

00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,410
space again clears those I don't want

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,220
that one

00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:54,900
maybe I'll go down here actually I want

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:57,210
to hit what was it okay so if I hit

00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,650
delete I clear everything not to be

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:02,790
confused with backspace because that's

00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:05,690
actually my search string so if I go

00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:09,020
back to this that's the entire list but

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:15,990
CGI is what we had and let's just take

00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:17,970
okay OOP don't really want to do that so

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:21,150
anyway you can see that's half way

00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:22,860
that's pretty awesome right I think it's

00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:27,390
way better than the Z's or the fish

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:29,940
experience so and actually thank you too

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:32,280
Olaf alders for I mean he suggested this

00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,190
to me about two-and-a-half or three

00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,940
months ago and I just got it totally

00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:42,059
working last night but I'm pretty happy

00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,429
with the way it turned out and actually

00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:48,030
I can use apply this to I did it in a

00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:51,480
generic way so that applying the that

00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:54,350
pager if you just turned it on any any

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,500
large set well you can do it that way

00:21:54,350 --> 00:22:00,800
okay let's go back to the time oops I

00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:03,800
don't know what happened

00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,800
straight

00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,690
let's go back to the wiki and see what

00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:15,750
said anything else we want to do no that

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:17,640
was it okay so how does bash completion

00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,649
work well basically you assign a

00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,299
function to a command and that function

00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:23,130
does the completion and it's usually

00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:25,679
underscore function name I mean that's

00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:28,289
kind of a just a way that it's normally

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:32,120
done but whatever that function is it

00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:35,580
sets a comp reply array and maybe some

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,620
what's called comp opt options then it

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,880
passes it off to read line and there's a

00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,740
number of read line things like the

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,120
single tab and all that kind of thing or

00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,190
that are actually read line things that

00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,649
are built into bash they don't exist on

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,480
all versions a bash and you can't do any

00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:49,649
customization of that red line stuff so

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,470
that's why I really want to throw out

00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:55,529
the read line part and do the fzf stuff

00:22:52,470 --> 00:23:01,440
when it was appropriate then I can get

00:22:55,529 --> 00:23:06,510
more like sea surface so and if you were

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,890
to type in complete it will list all of

00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,399
the completions let's see how many we

00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,399
have installed

00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:21,000
okay so 211 completions now these

00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:22,350
completions are auto loaded and not

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,570
everybody knows this so some people are

00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,919
making completion stuff and saying oh

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,360
yeah just source this thing in your bash

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,580
RC and you'll have completion for one

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,970
command that's silly

00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:35,010
and actually it uses up space in the

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:39,240
shell so if I say something like this

00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:43,110
type underscore Perl it's not found if I

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:47,309
say Perl and hit tab completion and I

00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:49,529
run that again now we have a function so

00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:51,090
that function was auto loaded the first

00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:52,860
time I run it and it's only in that show

00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,600
it stays in there for the rest of the

00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,940
shell but that's not a big deal you know

00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,409
because there's thousands of these

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,450
completions actually in the auto load

00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:02,010
library and you don't want all of those

00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:06,809
actually it's really interesting some of

00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:12,960
these let's look for one that's let's

00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:15,510
pipe to grep long up so long opt is a

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,910
generic one let's do saw some and first

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:23,790
let's say saw some

00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:30,390
- - help okay you see there's some flags

00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:33,240
up there now let's do saw some - - it's

00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:35,730
just actually grepping in real time the

00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,380
help command and providing those things

00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,840
of course they don't have descriptions

00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,770
because this is a generic thing an

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,330
excellent bash this never had

00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,330
descriptions until inky came around so

00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,420
yeah and so and it's all built over this

00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,100
framework that's actually existed since

00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,250
past 3 - which is what Matt comes with

00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:59,840
how many people know that Matt the bash

00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:08,310
on Mac sucks and will always suck its

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:10,530
bite it's locked into a 2007 version

00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:23,040
because of licensing issues and it's

00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:24,060
really starting to blow yeah yeah ok so

00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,000
here's some of the things that I think

00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:29,550
complete shell does for bash itself it

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,310
starts with the original framework so

00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:34,530
still can make use of that it adds

00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:38,940
descriptions it adds hints like if I

00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:45,570
were to say pearl let's see I think I

00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:50,730
have to do see us install pearl and then

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:54,530
I can say pearl - II didn't work out so

00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,530
great I think I have the old completion

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:05,870
I just you know when it showed you this

00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:14,090
thing that said hey you need FCF that

00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:23,390
was a hint but also if I say doing this

00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:23,780
in any show koroa - II okay that's kind

00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,340
of broken

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,049
but yeah it's giving a hint so forth

00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,700
there's certain things that you can't

00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:30,260
complete it's like you have to enter our

00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,120
reg ax or you have to enter a string and

00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,950
it'll just but I give those hints saying

00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,409
enter a string here or as much as

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:40,940
specific of a hands as I can give all I

00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:48,620
wanted this show see how many people get

00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:50,600
not this the FCF thing you've seen and I

00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:54,380
try to fix as much of the OS X sadness

00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:56,570
as I can it's still a work in progress

00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,020
who knows about I'm gonna show you

00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:01,880
something

00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:03,799
so this is a brand new shell so usually

00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,929
you type in env and it shows you all of

00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,159
your variables in the show well that's

00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:08,900
not all the variables in the shell those

00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:12,230
are all the exported variables in the

00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:14,630
show so if I pipe that to say WC there's

00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,940
eighty-one variables no big deal it's

00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:22,159
not polluted I would say but if I say

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:24,950
set ok sets giving me that's pipe ok so

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,929
I have 6,000 lines worth a crap and the

00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,669
Shelf that didn't need to be in there if

00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:29,900
it was auto loaded it would be great

00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:35,480
let's actually look at what some of the

00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:39,830
crap is a lot of it is get really what

00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:42,679
is it s is the bed in terms of this it

00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:45,980
just dumps all of this junk into your

00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:51,500
shell that you don't need and I think

00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:55,000
NPM is even worse I'm trying to see yeah

00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,000
so you get all of these functions

00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:03,480
I mean it's annoying hopefully I will

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:12,870
become the replacer of get and it'll all

00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:15,049
be smooth sailing we'll see okay so

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,100
basically you write these food comps and

00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:19,410
sometimes you need to call an actual

00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,750
function to get data you can't you know

00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:24,049
it's this DSL doesn't do it all let's

00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,049
look at

00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,970
it says it since table

00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,900
oh I know this

00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:58,659
it's taking the slide okay okay so

00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,480
here's the CPM this is what the

00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:03,940
completion file looks like it's a sum

00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:09,070
it's a name the command name the version

00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:10,840
of this spec what the command does and

00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,020
then I have a bunch of options and at

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:17,529
the bottom I have an argument that says

00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:18,909
call a Sipan module a function and you

00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:21,880
thought that that means it can be

00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:24,880
several of these so it you can do many

00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,799
and so if we go back to where's that

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,600
function defined it's defined on a CPM -

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,429
so sometimes you needed to find a

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,710
function and that's what CPM module does

00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:36,309
it calls complete shell pager which

00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:38,080
calls f c/f with these options because

00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:46,360
there might be other pagers I you know

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:49,539
got to be generic right the compiler is

00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,010
written in bash and I actually bash this

00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,970
almost the first programming language I

00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:58,570
reach for now I've done probably more

00:29:51,970 --> 00:30:01,899
invest in I got to be one of the written

00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:03,220
a lot of bash and it has this

00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:05,409
interactive test suite that's pretty

00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,480
cool so I'm just gonna show you real

00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:09,970
quick you have to run it in T MUX with a

00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,669
split screen or it will complain but um

00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,960
and then I just say make test so I was

00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:15,460
testing these things how do you test

00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,380
completions cuz you got to keep trying

00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,549
them right and you just go nuts and

00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,059
you're changing the code and I'm like I

00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:24,760
can't keep trying these things so I what

00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:27,909
I have here is on the left you see some

00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,770
inputs with tab and it and on the right

00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,570
you see what's happening and this is

00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,980
just the thing and when it's all done

00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,440
and complete I just press it again and

00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,149
it runs it again so every time I make a

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,159
coding change I just run this test suite

00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:42,370
again and I look for changes it's not as

00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:45,340
good as it's not proved yet but I can

00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,720
still see if it's stuff is way off or it

00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:49,260
helps me find bugs and I do this before

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,260
I make a release

00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:58,769
yeah undo those changes okay so I was

00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:01,559
going to show you really quickly how to

00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:09,419
make your own and how we doing on time

00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:15,169
like okay okay so I'm gonna make

00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:15,169
something called food comp let's call it

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,039
okay and then I'll say the first thing

00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,600
you need is a complete shell directive

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,649
it just says what version of the DSL

00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,659
you're using because I know this is

00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:30,690
going to change over time and I just

00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:32,249
wanted to and I want to give it a title

00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:34,710
digit so this is that's what kind of

00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:35,789
file this is so people have an idea what

00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:40,830
they're seeing if they just come across

00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:41,789
it and I'm just gonna say QWERTY and I

00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:45,320
don't need to give anything else

00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:49,139
actually and I'll just say command foo

00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:54,200
commands bar and that's good enough now

00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:54,200
I can say see we don't have

00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:10,740
so I'm gonna add so ad means is for a

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,390
file that's not in the registry that's

00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,750
not from a repo so something on your

00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:23,760
disk and I'm gonna say QWERTY comp and

00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:29,490
boom now if I type in yeah so now I have

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:31,850
that and if I turn on complete show well

00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,850
let's go in

00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:53,590
see if we can riad it I hope we can okay

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:57,980
and then we type in a complete shell

00:32:53,590 --> 00:33:01,550
config modern settings true then I can

00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,840
type in pretty well I don't have a

00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:05,930
QWERTY command so I can't have complete

00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:09,650
that part yeah so I get that cool right

00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:10,910
so not too hard to do and then if you

00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,350
want to publish it you put it into a

00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,940
repo and then you add it to the index

00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,460
that's in the complete shell repo it's

00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:19,010
under share search index and your give a

00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:28,520
pull request and that's how you would do

00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:29,840
it if you weren't me so here's all of

00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,850
the ones that I have done and not done

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:37,250
I'm trying to think of which ones I

00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:38,140
haven't done I haven't done a bunch of

00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,540
bone

00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:44,800
let's try plaque up so not actually

00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,800
let's look at ones that we have done so

00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:55,580
mmm that's a good one oh we can look at

00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:57,160
this one again okay so I have the

00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:00,050
commands are one letter things there's n

00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,880
there's oh there's there's a bunch of

00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:04,640
stuff and it's all documented there's a

00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:09,139
for args and there's C for sub commands

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:11,240
and if you put o or if you put o or a

00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:13,010
after an n then it applies to the

00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,540
command but if you want the argument of

00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,520
the options to apply to the sub command

00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,290
then you put it after that sub command

00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,860
is defined and it just figures out and

00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:23,659
does all the right stuff there's a lot

00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,490
of weird commands out there and so I'm

00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:27,860
still not done with all of the edge

00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:31,330
cases but it's it works pretty well for

00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,330
for most stuff

00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:45,590
okay

00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:47,450
so I was gonna hack a so here's what I

00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,790
did actually was trying to create 12

00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:51,980
repos at once by writing bash commands

00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:56,320
that just applied a change to 12

00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:58,520
directories and I got pretty far so I

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,350
had yeah head it doesn't come and I got

00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,430
about six of them done yeah that's when

00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,870
I had to go in and hand out it I'm

00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,290
actually getting perfect but here's one

00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,580
that's not complete so what I did was

00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:09,980
they made a directory I put a readme and

00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:12,380
app root and a command.com file in it

00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:15,520
and made it a get directory and made a

00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:25,520
repo for it so all that stuff's done I

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:29,420
put in so let's we'll say prove for Perl

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,680
6 that's the title right 76 it's a long

00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:36,620
time left and then I just did a man

00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:40,970
prove 6 and dumped it into here what

00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:45,500
seems like a good idea at the time so

00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:49,750
let's take all these and uh okay now

00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,750
there options can take

00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,980
all right we're getting there

00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:14,820
these commas aren't part of the DSO so

00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:17,180
let's get rid of this and for the rest

00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,570
of the stuff let's just comment it out

00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:26,750
all right so now we're done with that

00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:26,750
now I'm gonna go over to CDs source

00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:40,950
repos complete was it proof six let's

00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:43,560
finish this puppy off okay

00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:49,530
just double-check it anybody see

00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:52,730
anything wrong do I get trailing back

00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,730
spaces what

00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,960
oh yeah I mean that doesn't matter it's

00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:07,910
just a comment I don't care

00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:07,910
so anyway okay done for you thank you

00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:17,570
and let's get commits - man

00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:33,840
and let's just push that get puss right

00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:39,720
some okay guess it's out there

00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:42,020
oops and then let's see D let's go

00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,020
change

00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:59,100
so now I want to add this to the index

00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:42,090
all right

00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,090
see if this puppy works

00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:55,200
let's see

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,200
d predictive

00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,200
let's do um

00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,310
I need

00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,620
oh okay I got it

00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:37,930
you need to upgrade it okay cool so I

00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,550
just needed to run on CS upgrade and

00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:49,720
then I run now I have proof six let's

00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:52,270
install it prove six okay and then I say

00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:58,960
prove six I even have a proof six right

00:39:52,270 --> 00:40:13,510
yeah I do boom world's a better place

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:15,940
right five minutes for what yeah so

00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:17,350
what's next time I know if anybody's

00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,200
interested in joining we could have a

00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:22,230
buff tonight and knock out a bunch of

00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:25,530
pearl commands you know that's about it

00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:25,530
I'll take questions

00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:49,010
oh okay it I just got it from our

00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:51,270
webpage you know they were probably okay

00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:55,910
would you would you appreciate this

00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:55,910
framework working in case oh okay cool

00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:09,329
awesome I got to figure out how to do

00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:09,980
case did we call a case bran guards out

00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:16,770
of it

00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:18,900
sheesh next add another question was a

00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:29,040
Walkman now who else had a question

00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:30,780
young sir no no I mean yeah let's just

00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:36,599
you know it's like so we have this

00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:39,569
installed it still works I mean if if I

00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:51,690
made a get completion file and you

00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:53,910
installed it it would replace it oh yeah

00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:55,200
yeah so I mean I do that a lot so I mean

00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:57,000
I'm building I'm building over the

00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,349
abashed framework I mean get wrote their

00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,030
own stuff let's pretty clear about that

00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,790
so they're not something that I would

00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:06,020
actually maybe I would have to think

00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:06,020
about it maybe I'll do some good stuff

00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:11,720
right which I have done yeah

00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:21,780
so I right I don't think that's really

00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:23,550
the essence of this because it's like

00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,020
you just want to add one command to

00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:27,349
something that already has 100 commands

00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,349
and it's

00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:35,499
I'd have to think about it interesting

00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:51,979
well that's what they're saying yeah I

00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:55,130
think but you'd have to write it for

00:42:51,979 --> 00:42:56,660
every so and so what he I think what we

00:42:55,130 --> 00:43:01,239
want to do with this is generate it for

00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:01,239
one you know write winery and generated

00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:20,470
anything else anybody want to well
