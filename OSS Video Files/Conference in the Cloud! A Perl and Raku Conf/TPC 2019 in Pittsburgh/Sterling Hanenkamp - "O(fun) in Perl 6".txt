Title: Sterling Hanenkamp - "O(fun) in Perl 6"
Publication date: 2019-06-19
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	Update 2019-06-17: I'm giving this talk a new title, O(fun) in Perl 6. I am still going to talk about most of the things mentioned in my original synopsis, except not HTTP/3 because I haven't made time to wrap my mind around that topic yet. However, I was trying to finish up my slides and I was getting bored building the presentation and that's a bad sign. Instead, I'm going to do an even MOAR FUNNER presentation with bad grammar and hopefully some horrifying jokes thrown in and a light art display/hat, and a Big Red DON'T PUSH THE BUTTON button. Anyway, forgive my late chnage, but it needed to be made. Cheers.

This talk is primarily going to look at the P6WAPI specification, which I'm hoping to have drafted HTTP/3 support into by June, and Smack, the reference implementation, which should be released any time. I will be contrasting this against PSGI to show how async is central to this specification while preserving PSGI's familiarity. If time allows, I would like to also contrast it with Cro to compare the design trade-offs each system has made.

alright let's go and get started

00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:12,690
everybody having a good time so far all

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,309
right I'm sterling I worked for zip

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,800
recruiter that's all you ever need to

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,699
know about me and actually this whole

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,939
talk is about me

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,010
so it's gonna be great

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,869
this talk was originally titled

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,310
something else if you look outside it

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,390
probably says something else on the

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:34,260
paper out there I started writing that

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,550
talk and I got bored and I thought if

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,010
I'm bored

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:43,200
writing the talk you guys are gonna fall

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:45,210
asleep so let's not do that talk so

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,870
instead I'm gonna do Oh fun and Perl 6

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:56,820
which is going to cover that stuff too

00:00:48,870 --> 00:01:03,899
but just more briefly so who knows what

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:08,299
Oh fun is jazz that's right optimized

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:11,070
for fun so it's about things I love so I

00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:13,799
somebody gave a talk years and years and

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:18,960
years ago I'm really old not as old as

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,460
Chaz but where as somebody mentioned Oh

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,920
fun and I could just call all my hobbies

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,450
Oh fun now especially because there's a

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,619
lot of people I say that this is a

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:31,079
no-fun project and they look at me like

00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:36,090
what does that even mean and then I

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:41,090
don't explain so it's about things I

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,930
love one of those things is Perl 6 I

00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:47,820
really like Perl 6

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:51,990
I think Perl 6 is imperfect but such is

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:55,140
life but all of my Oh fun projects seem

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,460
to involve it in one sense or another at

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,079
least insofar as they involve

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:04,159
programming if you ever want me to talk

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,719
your ear off ask me about 3d printing

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,830
because I really like 3d printing I

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,400
started

00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:13,290
that before this conference last year in

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,720
Salt Lake City actually used the comp

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,320
this conference as my excuse for buying

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:23,580
the 3d printer can I get this closer to

00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:26,580
me I feel like it's really like there is

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,480
that better yeah that's much better

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,740
okay so that's a little boom eight stone

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,300
[Music]

00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:37,410
so 3d printing is the thing I really

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:40,080
like a lot I have a Prusa i3 mark three

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:45,390
smmu 2's so I can tell you what all that

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:48,510
means after class I also have gotten

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,850
recently into homemade electronics I got

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:55,440
into computer science because I hate

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:57,120
hardware and all the physical like

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,330
hardware bits and reality are

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,590
problematic they don't like electricity

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,910
is stupid it works in the dumbest ways

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:08,310
and I don't understand it it's like

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,980
they're the the stuff inside my computer

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:16,790
contains magic smoke and as long as I

00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:20,010
don't let it out it works and however

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:23,130
that that that was my old line my new

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,390
line is actually hardware's getting kind

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,060
of fun I don't know if you've messed

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,760
with hardware in the last five or so

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:33,540
years but now you can buy stuff from

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,760
like spark fun and Adafruit and random

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,030
people from on eBay that are in China

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,489
and you can get like modules that are

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,230
pre-built and you just sort of like run

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,370
wires between them and they do things

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,540
and you don't have to worry about

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,950
letting out the magic smoke because

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,290
they've put all the right diodes and

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,790
resistors in there unless they're from

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,550
China and then maybe you have to be more

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:57,720
careful but even for the stuff from

00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:59,100
China is pretty good these days so I've

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,739
gotten into this this is this is really

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,239
fun and I'm going to show off some of

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:08,549
those electronics you might have noticed

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:11,489
and I also love children might me not

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,070
your children and I like books

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,299
especially reading books to children and

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,299
I'm going to talk about that too

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:24,260
and I'm really weird

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:27,230
just so you know so I gave this talk

00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:30,050
last year and I really like the fact

00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:33,080
that when that the video of my talk to

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,340
went up that that this book got put up

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,780
as the thumbnail that nay even though

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,260
it's like midway through the talk and

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,250
it's this short short slide and I didn't

00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,580
have this book with me cuz I couldn't

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:46,340
find it this year I actually saw this

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:49,310
book sitting out about two weeks ago and

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,930
I grabbed it and hid it in my room

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,310
because I knew it would disappear again

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:58,100
because my four year old likes this book

00:04:52,310 --> 00:05:00,140
a lot so he's probably he if he knew I

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,120
took it he'd be angry in fact he was

00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:09,620
angry that I took some of these things

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:10,610
with the electronics I brought so the

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,800
reason I put that slide up is because

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,360
I'm gonna give you the report of so I

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,890
just gave me like the general overview

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,690
of things I love now I'm gonna give you

00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:24,550
the specific things I loved this year

00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:27,200
I'm sure you're excited so 3d printing

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:32,690
mega man that's a big Mega Man by the

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:35,540
way that that model took it was it's

00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,880
designed by a youtuber who goes by chaos

00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:44,480
court tech I assume that's not his real

00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:50,300
name and it's it's pretty big it took a

00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:53,390
hundred 30 hours to print it came in

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,900
twenty some parts it's in five different

00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:59,000
colors the everything below the head is

00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,260
glued together actually it's not glued

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,970
together right now because there was an

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:06,050
accident involving my hand reaching for

00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:09,620
a light switch and I need to fix that so

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:11,480
he's kind of in bits right now and then

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,220
everything from the head up is pressure

00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:18,890
fit so it was kind of fun taking a

00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:22,130
mallet and hammering his eyes in so and

00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,140
it's this actually represents so of

00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,300
those five colors I used almost an

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:27,890
entire spool of that that dark blue

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,370
color and if you know anything about

00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:33,100
filming that's a lot of plastic like I

00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,630
print

00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,310
sorts of stuff all the time and it seems

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,410
like I never go through filament but I

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:42,850
went through entire to spool so that

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:45,520
this mega man weighs like I don't know

00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,630
seven pounds it's like four kilograms of

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,310
filament

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:55,750
he's pretty fun I also upgraded my

00:06:51,310 --> 00:07:00,660
printer so there's my mark 2s with an

00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:02,410
enclosure and it has pretty lights on it

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,910
unfortunately I can't use the enclosure

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,100
right now because of something else that

00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:08,680
happened but the remainder of those

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:12,670
lights I put in my wife's kitchen so my

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,370
wife's happy um I'm trying to figure

00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,020
this thing out my my I got a Christmas

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,210
tree from Home Depot and it has this

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,820
fascinating set of lights that change

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,700
colors like they're like neopixels

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,950
except they have only two lines so those

00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,440
two lines coming out are the only two

00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,880
lines going to that and if you know

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,220
anything about electronics

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,860
that means it's sending data and power

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,270
over the same lines somehow and I'm

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,040
still trying to figure that out and if I

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,360
figure it out I'm gonna like design my

00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:48,100
own custom controller and put it on my

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:49,480
tree we don't talk about this my son

00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,600
started Taekwondo just created pretty

00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:56,800
cool he's probably getting his orange

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,540
belt soon the other the reason I can't

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,220
use the enclosure is because of this

00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,830
upgrade so now I have this big thing

00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,330
that sits on top of my printer and you

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,730
can see some of the parts that came and

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,830
I had to put it all together and that

00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,630
was really fun well it was fun for about

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,850
the first 10 hours and then I spent the

00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,240
next 20 hours fiddling with it trying to

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,920
get everything adjusted just right and I

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,990
was about to check it out the window but

00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,590
it it all came out all right and the end

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:26,170
is I can print in multiple colors now so

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,670
with printing 3d printing if you know

00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:31,390
anything about it you can print one

00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:36,580
color per layer but having multiple

00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:39,849
colors in a layer is complicated which

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:42,419
enabled me to build this which I also

00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:42,419
have up here

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:51,640
which ties into lists as well and then

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,870
when I go home one of the things I'm

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,300
going to do is start messing with this

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:58,920
big box of you can't really see it this

00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:02,230
picture was taken by my son yesterday

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,270
but so these are bits and pieces of

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,800
robots that I'm going to be building

00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:09,970
with my three sons we're going to

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:12,640
assemble some robots to do they wanted

00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,270
to do laser tag robots and I'm not going

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,400
to let them do it

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:20,410
remote control they have to program it

00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:22,390
for real we went to go see these so this

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:26,170
is like an aside so we went to Silver

00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:28,060
Dollar City as one does and we went to a

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:31,900
show called the Phoenix fire dancers and

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,100
it was really a cool show for most of

00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,650
the show over the last half of the show

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,520
they're dancing with fire which is why

00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:42,790
they're called the Phoenix fire dancers

00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:47,020
but for the first part of the show they

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:49,330
had like big like bo staffs and

00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,950
nunchucks and all sorts of stuff they

00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:54,430
were dancing with that were all lit up

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,380
by flashing LEDs that made all kinds of

00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:59,080
cool patterns and it was amazing so now

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,850
I'm like this this I need to do

00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:03,810
something with this so that's that's a

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:08,830
future project I probably come up with

00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:12,030
and then that was my oldest son with he

00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:14,680
uses my printer more than I do now and

00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,530
then this I was actually telling Chad's

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,600
about this before Mike just before my

00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:26,200
talk so for about two bucks you can get

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:28,930
three of these little modules and this

00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,370
module is kind of cool in that first you

00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,870
have to solder it all together yourself

00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,420
so it's soldering practice for me

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:38,950
because my soldering is really really

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:43,540
awful but that actually doesn't look too

00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:46,270
bad but that those two wires on the end

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,700
that this this is basically a thing that

00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:52,270
boosts the voltage up to a level where

00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:54,370
you can arc electricity across the the

00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,320
two ends of those wires at the end there

00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,770
and with five volts you can catch things

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:03,880
on fire so if you put a radio

00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:05,200
transmitter on that with a battery on

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,570
fourth of July

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,029
I think this virus I a radio receiver

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,279
and a battery I think there can be fun

00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:15,760
especially if it involves a button

00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,740
you're not supposed to push alright so

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,930
um this is the don't push a button

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,570
button and unfortunately it has not

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:26,529
traveled well it's got like three

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:29,050
different bad connections inside but I'm

00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:32,680
gonna pass this around you all are

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:35,970
supposed to don't push the button it

00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,970
says it all right here on it

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,339
would you would you like please be

00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:49,560
gentle with it it it's like I said it

00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:52,839
didn't travel well yes

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,400
so the excuse for buying the 3d printer

00:11:52,839 --> 00:12:01,480
was I was going to make a nametag last

00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:04,570
year which I did and the I did not want

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:08,170
to have open electronics because that

00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:10,089
seemed like an error for the TSA I I

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,620
joke about taking the electronics with

00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:13,570
the wires hanging out and then some

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,520
blobs of clay with me just to see what

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,560
TSA does but I'm not really that brave

00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:25,839
maybe if I was single I would do that

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:27,370
but no the tip so the TSA asks you to

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,250
take all electronics larger than a cell

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:34,930
phone out I kind of didn't tell him

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:36,610
about it we see I would have just said

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:45,070
well when I was a kid a cell phone was

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:47,560
about that big so so the the button is

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:53,380
part of the talk the button is got a

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:56,070
esp8266 chip inside and it's kind of

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,070
running pro six

00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:02,089
the head is also kind of actually the

00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:05,029
buttons not running pro-sex the hats

00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:08,149
kind of running pro six I should say so

00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:11,089
this is a hat it's really heavy so I was

00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:13,100
putting it on the podium because the

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:14,779
backing plate here is metal ties and

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,360
I've got four nickel metal hydride

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:22,459
batteries in a pack up here and it's

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,839
it's really heavy and I figured it would

00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:28,730
fall off my head if I'm talking and not

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:31,639
paying attention so it's sort of running

00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,019
pearl six so here's here is one of the

00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,980
pearl six programs it could be running

00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:36,589
it's not actually running this one

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,959
because this one's I picked one that was

00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:40,939
short which isn't actually one that's

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,290
running although I could have picked one

00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:46,660
that is running on there now because I

00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:49,459
added some that are about this short so

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:52,399
this is pro 6e it's got used v6 at the

00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:54,290
top and then this is all pearl six and

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:59,329
tax why didn't that slide get the

00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:00,860
correct font oh well yeah it's pro six

00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:07,819
see it's running pro six

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:09,860
oh so it's pearl six but it's if you

00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:12,170
know strong bed this is the virus email

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:18,079
it's being eaten by some Linux or

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:21,019
something it's like the ugliest the most

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,990
hideous pearl six ever and it's not

00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:28,189
actually running that pearl six so what

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:29,089
it's actually running is this now if you

00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:30,649
don't even if you don't know anything

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:33,800
out pearl six you're gonna be like how I

00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:35,389
did not see anything that does this okay

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,899
what you did but you didn't know you

00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:42,819
didn't and the way it works is this so

00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:46,579
program up there is not a pearl six

00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:49,399
built in of any kind it's just a

00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:54,620
subroutine and that subroutine takes a

00:14:49,399 --> 00:15:01,490
code reference and in Perl 6 every block

00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:02,959
is a code reference so every block is a

00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,249
magic code reference and some of them

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,500
are pointy blocks so if you look down

00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:08,300
there by loop there's a pointy block and

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,240
in a pointy block it's like a subroutine

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,399
with arguments

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,379
and that's like if you know nothing

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,059
about four loops in Perl 6 the four

00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:19,720
loops are actually receiving a pointy

00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:23,829
block as well or you could put it a

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:27,459
regular block if you want and then the

00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:33,009
other thing is is that dollar sign

00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:34,809
underscore in Perl 6 has is used

00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:38,529
slightly differently than it is in Perl

00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:41,559
5 so in Perl 5 dollar sign underscore

00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:42,550
has this problem where it's you can do

00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:44,889
whatever you want you can hold on to it

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:50,529
if you want to yeah just just don't push

00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:52,300
the button in so dollar sign underscore

00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:57,399
has a slightly different use in pro 6

00:15:52,300 --> 00:16:03,040
Pro 5 problem which functions use the

00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:05,350
dollar sign underscore variable that's

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,740
implied like if you call a function and

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:10,119
you don't give it an argument it will it

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,850
will use the dollar sign underscore but

00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:14,829
it's unclear which ones use it in Perl 6

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,420
it's clear which ones use it because you

00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:18,939
just use this dot notation which

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,379
basically says I'm calling a method on

00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:23,470
dollar sign underscore if I don't

00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:25,899
specify anything before the dot so and

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:29,679
dot replace the arrow operator in Pro 5

00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:31,389
if you're not aware of that if you've

00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:39,790
been under a rock for the past several

00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:41,889
years Perl 6 is totally released so what

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,529
happens is inside of that so that

00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:46,329
program method I'm sorry the program

00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:47,769
subroutine at top gets that code

00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:54,759
reference before it calls the code

00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:58,269
reference it makes the program builder

00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:00,339
object dollar sign underscore and so

00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:03,759
every one of those dots is calling a

00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:07,299
method on program builder program

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:10,240
builder is a code generator so if you

00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:11,649
look through here it has this self ops

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,649
I'm not actually explaining any of this

00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:16,809
in detail I can go into it in detail

00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:18,250
afterwards if you want to there's just

00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:20,889
not enough time to go through it all but

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,020
this ops thing basically is pushing

00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:25,120
operations onto

00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,830
the code that and the code that's being

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,520
generated so op sub is an operation op

00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:32,230
return is an operation pop here is an

00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:36,190
operation op halt of course it's an

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:42,900
operation op return op go sub this this

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:42,900
is all integers that make up byte code

00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:49,930
like this so here are a bunch of the

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:52,720
operations so of course op halt is dead

00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:55,330
and then we have a bunch of others ah

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,910
peak for the you know equal operator and

00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,130
it's it's kind of an RPN thing so you

00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,040
push things on to a stack and then this

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:06,550
pops operations off and runs them

00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:08,770
because that's easy and here's the

00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,810
actual the start of the actual VM the

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:18,370
actual vm's like pages and pages long

00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:19,870
and I'm not putting it on slides and

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:21,580
then here's here's where some of the

00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:24,100
execution of the operations happen in

00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,790
the VM you'll notice this this is no

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,790
longer pro 6

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:41,410
so I do a lot of C++ too I'm not

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,180
especially a fan of C++ but it turns out

00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,620
that it's kind of handy to know if

00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,870
you're gonna do embedded programming

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,600
right now I would love to learn how to

00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,220
run Perl 6 on an ESB I don't I don't

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,900
know i don't i can't even imagine how

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,910
you would even run it on an arduino with

00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,480
the memory footprint available to you

00:18:54,910 --> 00:19:01,990
there but i think on something like an

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,700
ESP it might even be possible somehow

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:14,700
I'd like to figure that out at some

00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:17,770
point okay so this is the program and

00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:21,670
then I do something to run it and then

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:25,090
something to get it onto the thing to

00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:28,390
run well I just mentioned that I'm using

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:32,770
ESP so that the button is an esp8266

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:36,070
chip esp8266 chip is a Wi-Fi enabled

00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:39,370
microcontroller made by espresso a

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:41,440
chinese company this one is using the

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,210
development version of the next version

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,120
of that chip which is called the ESP 32

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:50,770
which is kind of in pre-release but it's

00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:55,870
really easy to get as a hobbyist and so

00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:57,040
it runs the it's it's similar but it

00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,200
also has a bunch of other features like

00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:04,090
bluetooth capability built in and some

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,640
other things and but there's no how do

00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:11,860
they get the program on there well

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:16,660
obviously I used a web service so here's

00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:21,630
a crow anybody know what crow is anybody

00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:24,520
written the crow service whoo crows cool

00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,380
so I wrote this service in crow last

00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,810
year and it's not a very good not a very

00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:33,670
good example of one but it is an example

00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:37,210
of one and crow is a way of doing

00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:39,340
asynchronous web programming which is

00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,660
what my talk was originally about and

00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,680
we're going to talk all about this stuff

00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,680
and I was getting bored

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:51,309
so just to explain what's happening here

00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,500
it has kind of a dancer style interface

00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:55,420
to it at least it feels like dancing to

00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:00,520
me as somebody who's never actually used

00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:02,020
dancer so you declare the you declare

00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,570
this route so again

00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,770
route here up there I'm pointing and I

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,799
can see what I'm pointing at but you

00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:13,240
guys can't see what I'm pointing it

00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:15,280
route here is a function that takes a

00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,580
code ref and it does a bunch of magic to

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,250
make to consume all of these things like

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,049
post here and so post says I'm gonna

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,030
create a new path that takes post

00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:26,950
requests and then you pass it remember I

00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:29,890
mentioned pointy blocks you pass it

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,240
these pointy blocks that tell it what

00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,940
the path should be and so they actually

00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:37,900
use the signature of the functions that

00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:40,320
take the arguments as the way of

00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:44,950
defining the path which is kind of nifty

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:48,070
and kind of magical too but because the

00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:52,870
way pearl handles multi dispatch that

00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:54,100
ends up working pretty well is that

00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:57,720
really enough of that I can't remember

00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:01,830
where I am the way slice now oh yeah I

00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,830
also want talk about my toddler clock

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:15,770
I'm only halfway through holy cow this

00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:17,720
may end early guys so that's my toddler

00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,350
except clearly he's not a toddler

00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,830
anymore

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:25,180
he's also like a hundred and sixtieth

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:28,100
percentile on weight and height so

00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,360
that's 100 60th percentile if you know

00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:35,150
math that's not a thing that was

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:37,480
supposed to be a joke so it's actually a

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:40,250
preschooler clock now

00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:44,540
so what's it do you guys know what a

00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:49,760
toddler clock is do any of you have

00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:54,250
young children so what's one thing a

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,250
young child does when they're sleeping

00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:02,510
they don't sleep sleeping like a baby is

00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:05,500
the biggest joke ever I have never met a

00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,500
baby that sleeps like a baby

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,950
certainly not my children like we have

00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,630
friends of like oh he just sleeps all

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,870
the time we go for a ride to the Walmart

00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:17,570
he just falls asleep no no my children

00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:19,520
never ever fall asleep ever and it makes

00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:26,150
us a little crazy like we're just a

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:29,720
little crazy for sleep so I said one day

00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:33,650
to my wife I just want a clock that

00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,330
turns like green when they're allowed to

00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:37,370
wake up and they can look at the clock

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:40,790
and it's yellow or some other color

00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:42,620
they're not allowed to get up well it

00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:45,590
turns out such a thing actually exists

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:49,280
and if you attended my talk last year

00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:53,090
you hold the story about why buying one

00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:57,380
of those might be a bad idea which

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:59,030
involves my middle son who is was the

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:05,000
one pictured in the center of that

00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:07,310
picture of Taekwondo he he when he was

00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,920
about this well he wasn't this size when

00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:11,510
he was this age when he was about four

00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,060
he was still using the toddler clock it

00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,630
was in his room and about 3:00 in the

00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,170
morning

00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:20,640
I wake up to him

00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:23,950
reaming like someone has stabbed him and

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:30,280
we go in there and he's screaming and

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:35,130
the toddler clock is going someone

00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:35,130
decided to put a beeper on there a

00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:46,750
beeper on there for low battery

00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:49,890
indicator so that clock went into the

00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,880
trash that day and was never seen again

00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:55,420
actually it's not true we kept it for a

00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:58,320
long time and then we throw it away so I

00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:00,370
decided when we had a third child that

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,140
even though that hadn't actually gone to

00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:05,320
the trash yet I was not putting that in

00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:08,170
his room because I can't be trusted to

00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,610
change batteries and besides cheating

00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:12,550
batteries is so wasteful why would you

00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:16,530
change them early and why would you put

00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:23,670
a beeper on it that's ridiculous anyway

00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:26,140
so I made a another clock that my clock

00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:28,180
uses basically the almost the exact same

00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,400
software that runs this thing because

00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,750
I'm too lazy to be bothered with writing

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,580
more software when I've already written

00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,970
something that kind of does what I need

00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:43,090
already and and it's blue during the day

00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:46,810
and it's yellow at night he's outgrowing

00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:49,930
it he's he's like for now he can totally

00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:52,630
read clocks now he we can be able we

00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:54,700
could tell them at any time here here's

00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,970
a regular clock in your room and you're

00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:03,280
allowed to get up after the big number

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:04,990
says 7:00 and not sooner the one thing

00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:07,420
we can say for I can't say for my

00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:10,090
children is that they refuse to get out

00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:11,200
of bed unless they're they've been

00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,700
allowed out of bed and it's not like

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,410
I've ever punished them for getting out

00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,030
of bed early they're just like they

00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:19,650
begged me to come in to let them out of

00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:19,650
bed I'm like okay

00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:28,530
so we're gonna make this into a toy oh

00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:29,490
wait I already did so I've turned the

00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:32,970
sound off because you wouldn't be able

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:34,410
hear it anyway but so here is the

00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,330
toddler clock that's that thing on the

00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,590
thing that flashing there and you can

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:40,559
see oh look it's the don't push a button

00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,760
button and he thinks it's hilarious that

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:49,470
he gets to push that don't push a button

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:52,110
button oh I did turn over son you can

00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,309
barely get any way I can't turn the

00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:58,770
sound down that's amazing

00:26:53,309 --> 00:27:01,200
so as you can see it's flashing that is

00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:04,530
a very what we would call an MVP

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,880
addition of this of this solution at

00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,530
work we would call that a Minimum Viable

00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,610
Product

00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:13,470
so flashing was the easiest easiest way

00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:16,200
to make it do something weird what I

00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:17,970
wanted to do is more stuff so if if

00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,570
you'll indulge me I'm gonna read this

00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:23,730
book not all of it just parts of it so

00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,220
this book is by a bill Cotter I highly

00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:29,040
recommend it if you have young children

00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:31,880
first grade or younger it's it's really

00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:36,110
fun if you if you have older children

00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:41,429
they they will also like it they just

00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:44,730
will pretend they don't like it so hi my

00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:49,460
name is Larry welcome to my book there's

00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:49,460
only one rolled don't push the button

00:27:51,440 --> 00:28:00,510
seriously don't even think about it it

00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:04,350
does look pretty nice though I wonder

00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:06,420
what would happen if we pushed it and

00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,309
this is a part where as a parent you you

00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,260
you know feel sad because your child is

00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:12,030
getting older because my son used to do

00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,559
this thing he'd read this part or he

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,730
would after I did it a few times he

00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:19,350
would always insist on saying it himself

00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:20,640
he'd say no we can't we mustn't and he

00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:25,380
would do the arm action everything it

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:29,309
was great no one is looking you should

00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:31,500
give the button one little push and then

00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:34,030
of course ah now I'm yellow push it

00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:37,480
again and it gets worse

00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:41,710
I won't spoil the end but in order for

00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,630
me to fully make the don't push the

00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,860
button button work to the best extent

00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:53,950
possible it will have to have an

00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:57,430
accelerometer in it so this book is

00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:58,720
great and I want to make this do some of

00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:00,310
the interesting things so we'll have to

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,550
turn the light we'll have to turn like

00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:05,590
some sort of greenish garish yellow

00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:08,320
really bright and then maybe have it

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:09,940
flash green and purple and then all

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,910
sorts of colors and each time it gets

00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,770
the lowers which makes me which all this

00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,570
also this progression also makes me want

00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:18,640
to build one of those if you guys seen

00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,080
those awesome boxes where you flip the

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,670
switch and like the cat or whatever

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,510
reaches out and switches and closes the

00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:26,800
box I really want to make one of those

00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,470
there's so many fun things to make in

00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:34,570
the world no I already did that

00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:38,860
hello no I already did that move to the

00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:44,410
next slide okay so I guess this leads me

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:47,190
into how much time we have left ten

00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,190
minutes okay

00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:53,530
so going on to my original topic so I'm

00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:56,230
gonna start boring you know and about

00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:58,510
five years ago I created this thing

00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:00,670
called the web api for Perl 6 and I had

00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:05,140
this idea that I would I would spearhead

00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:10,410
the move towards a PSG I type thing for

00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:13,000
Perl 6 and I'm really bad at community

00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:14,980
like I'm really like horrible at it

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,550
because I just want to spend time with

00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:20,350
my kids and so I don't spend a lot of

00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,750
time in chat rooms or on email lists and

00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:26,370
stuff like that so if someone is

00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:29,800
interested in in helping spearhead this

00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:33,160
and taking it forward I think there is a

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,530
demand there's - well there's basically

00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:38,410
one implementation of something like it

00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,820
called crust and I have never touched it

00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:42,610
I've never looked at it I've never

00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:46,570
messed with it as anybody who works on

00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:50,570
crust here I didn't think so

00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:53,600
anyway I have a thing called won't I

00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:54,559
have a thing called smack which is

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,750
supposed to be the reference

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,100
implementation of this and cruft

00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:01,909
is kind of like the reference

00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:05,379
implementation of Perl 5 PS di and Perl

00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:10,340
6 which if you know anything about PSG I

00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:13,850
it's it's great I mean I don't want to I

00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:18,100
want to say that it's it's bad but it's

00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:22,970
dated PSG I was built in a time where

00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:29,019
HTTP 1.1 was state of the art before

00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:33,490
WebSockets before HTTP 2 before HTTP 3

00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:35,750
and we now live in a universe where just

00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,639
synchronously taking a request and

00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:40,850
sending a response is no longer what the

00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:42,919
web is about it's it's more complicated

00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:45,350
than that it's still what it technically

00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:49,309
happens but it's more complicated than

00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:50,809
that it's a much more nuanced and so one

00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:52,519
of the things I was trying to well I

00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:54,200
started just trying to translate PSG I

00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:56,870
and Perl 6 and then a bunch of people

00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,129
said don't do that that's dumb web has

00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,179
moved on since then and then I started

00:31:58,129 --> 00:32:02,929
during your search I'm like yeah you're

00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:07,759
right it has moved on and so part of the

00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:09,409
the issue is is that it's much more

00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,980
asynchronous now the way we think about

00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:14,419
web programming and Perl 6 has this

00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:16,850
amazing thing built-in called

00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:19,370
asynchronous programming has all sorts

00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:25,519
of support tools for it and so I use

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:28,610
those so as an example this protocol has

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:31,970
built into it the use of supplies and

00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:33,580
the use of promises but all of those

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,799
things are built in such a way that they

00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:39,950
you could use synchronous tools and

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:43,940
upgrade towards that so if you provide

00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:46,490
in Perl 6 if you provide a list you can

00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,799
coerce a list into a supply which is the

00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:52,610
like asynchronous version of that so if

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:54,769
you don't know a supply is like it's

00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:57,559
like a stream of promises where I'm

00:32:54,769 --> 00:33:00,109
gonna deliver items to out of this list

00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:02,149
as whenever they come

00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:03,679
whereas a list is we wait until we get

00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:04,999
the whole thing and then we deliver all

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:11,720
you know throw a lot of them at you at

00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:13,970
once and so anyway but if you have a

00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,499
list you can you can seamlessly upgrade

00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,119
so if you have all the all the items at

00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:19,609
once you can deliver them as a supply

00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,049
and that hack can happen more or less

00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:23,269
automatically and this tries to take

00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:24,619
advantage of that and I think I've done

00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:26,960
a good job of it but the reason that

00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:32,599
this has been a point seven point draft

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,799
since I don't know 2016 it's because I

00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:36,049
really haven't had a lot of time to mess

00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:37,639
with it so if anyone is interested in

00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:39,830
web programming and learning about HTTP

00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:41,330
two and maybe even trying to implement

00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,320
it which is actually really interesting

00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,849
like if you don't know anything about

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,649
HTTP 2 you should you should read about

00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:47,929
it because it's a really interesting

00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:49,340
like I don't know maybe I'm just a nerd

00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:51,109
and I like it

00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,239
but it's a really interesting like

00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:54,859
change in the way of thinking about HTTP

00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:59,029
1 and I've started reading about htv-3

00:33:54,859 --> 00:34:00,919
and that one kind of breaks my brain but

00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:04,580
it's basically from what I can tell HTTP

00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:07,549
2 except now it's running over UDP sort

00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:11,649
of well it's actually running over UDP

00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:11,649
but it's more complicated than that -

00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:18,619
this is probably my most popular module

00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:20,839
on the perl 6 modules list there are the

00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:22,099
Perl 6 ecosystem as it used to be called

00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:24,950
I don't know what to call the Perl 6

00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:27,379
module system anymore we don't have a

00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:34,069
seat pan we have a we have modules dot

00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:37,129
Perl 6 that org it's kind of Sipan but

00:34:34,069 --> 00:34:38,990
Dom tiny is cool I would love to talk

00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:40,879
about that more with you guys it's

00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:44,329
basically if you you guys were made with

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:48,159
Dom tiny and pro 5 know are you familiar

00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:51,290
with was it mojo

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,700
what is that thing called Dom tiny was

00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:55,879
its old name it has a new name now and

00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:59,390
it has something to do with mojo it's

00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:05,210
basically a really cool little parser

00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:07,460
for HTML or XML many of this new project

00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:09,859
I'm working on called cofre which is a

00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,720
common objects framework which is

00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:13,080
basically like all the things I hate

00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,240
repeating myself in

00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:19,290
Perl 6 thrown into an application

00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:22,410
framework it's kind of like a mixture of

00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:24,600
an inversion of control and web

00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:26,700
application framework built together put

00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:30,870
together also there's some things about

00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:32,310
CRO that I find irritating like how

00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,470
similar it is to dancer which I don't

00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:37,050
like there's a reason I haven't used it

00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:41,430
but I don't like catalyst either so I

00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:43,230
don't like anything I'm an engineer okay

00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,450
that's kind of the end of my talk I

00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:47,330
would like to say thanks to my employers

00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:50,460
that recruiter for sending me here and

00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:52,230
they are a really great place to work so

00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:58,170
if you are looking for a job we are

00:35:52,230 --> 00:36:00,660
always hiring and yeah I've worked there

00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:04,350
for like four years now which is a long

00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,250
time and yeah I really enjoy working

00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,950
there

00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:12,330
Chaz works there and Chad works there

00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:13,680
and vall works there you can talk to any

00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:17,100
of us who else

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:26,880
but Oh Ben Ben's here

00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:29,100
Ben's even a manager even Ben was hired

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,350
after me like a whole week and a half or

00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:43,280
something but now he's a manager any

00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:43,280
questions ask me about 3d printing yeah

00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:48,910
the box yes I did forget to mention I

00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:51,880
was going to say so the box is a four

00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:53,140
color print it's got silver yellow okay

00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,849
here's how nerdy I'm I could probably

00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:58,180
tell you the brands of each one of those

00:36:54,849 --> 00:37:01,510
filaments and they're like random weird

00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:03,460
names so yeah it's four it's four colors

00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:07,030
I was printed all at once silver black

00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:10,300
yellow and white the white never buy

00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:14,200
that I don't like the white on there but

00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,730
the rest of the colors are fine so yeah

00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,050
that was a four color print it was

00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:19,030
printed on the face with the lid at the

00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:21,430
same time I think that print was 20

00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:23,500
hours so the thing about the thing about

00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:24,550
3d printing something of that size if it

00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,730
was a single color it would probably

00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:31,290
take I don't know four or five hours I

00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:34,480
would guess but in multicolor because

00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,980
the printer basically has one set of

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,680
motors that are moving the head around

00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:41,619
and extruding the the plastic that its

00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,750
melting onto the plate and it has

00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:47,080
another set of motors that load and

00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:49,420
unload filament so what happens is it

00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:52,450
does all the all of the yellow for a

00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:56,260
layer and then the head stops and then

00:37:52,450 --> 00:38:00,130
it pulls the yellow out puts the black

00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:02,170
in and then it goes and it has to purge

00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,240
the yellow that I just had in it from

00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:07,740
the head because otherwise the colors

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:10,450
that mix in really ugly ways and so it

00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:12,369
prints on a little it builds up a

00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:16,810
separate block of purse so you waste

00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:18,250
some plastic this way and then and then

00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:20,830
it prints some more and then it does it

00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:25,230
again so that takes that usually

00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:25,230
quadruples the time in my experience

00:38:27,689 --> 00:38:32,199
there so the question is is there

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,569
anything such thing as a for extruder

00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:36,009
head yes there are actually several

00:38:34,569 --> 00:38:38,559
different ways of doing that that I've

00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:40,419
seen and this is all I'm all talk I'm

00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,799
just talking about FDM printing where

00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:43,329
you've got a spool of plastic that

00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:46,179
you're feeding in it melts the plastic

00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:47,469
and lays it down layer by layer there

00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:51,369
are different printing technologies

00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:53,829
that's just one of them and but yes if

00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:56,049
you're doing that one possible solution

00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:58,449
is you can have either multiple heads so

00:38:56,049 --> 00:39:01,269
you have two heads are pretty common

00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:04,449
four heads I have not seen very often

00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:08,259
but I do think they exist there you have

00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:10,749
problems where that so the the thing

00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:13,539
about 3d printing is you need micron

00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:15,939
level alignment of the head up and down

00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:17,499
and then when you have two heads you

00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:20,169
have to get both of them aligned

00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:21,609
perfectly to set like almost I don't

00:39:20,169 --> 00:39:24,999
know if it's sub micron but it's like

00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:30,130
superfine alignment and that's that's

00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:33,039
really hard so you do see that some mind

00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:35,289
changes another another solution is you

00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:37,659
can there's a there's a product called

00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:41,589
mosaic which uses C I'm going to talk

00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:43,929
forever which fuses filament together as

00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:45,279
it goes so like has a splicer inside and

00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:47,439
its own hot end and it fuses them

00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:48,969
together ahead and then you just have to

00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:51,309
have like special software to make sure

00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:53,140
to synchronize the changes so that

00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:56,709
they're about right and you don't like

00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,769
slide off and go off into lala land and

00:39:56,709 --> 00:40:02,979
end up with weird colors

00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:06,009
there's also tool changers where the

00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:09,219
head is modular and it picks up the head

00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:11,409
moves it to a side and dumps you know

00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:14,409
whatever heads got on and then pops on a

00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,849
new head and that new head has its each

00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:22,169
of the heads have the filament attached

00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:22,169
them directly yeah yeah like that

00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,529
the the problem and then that I mean

00:40:25,539 --> 00:40:27,939
each of these have their own trade offs

00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:30,130
like engineering is all trade offs of

00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:31,839
course right and so the trade off on

00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:33,210
that one is that you have to make sure

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,970
that whatever does

00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:40,430
latching doesn't throw off that like

00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:42,990
micron level alignment on each grab so

00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:48,300
there has to be some like metal-on-metal

00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:50,610
kind of thing to make sure that it's it

00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,540
stays aligned or you can just accept the

00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:54,120
fact that you're going to have sloppy

00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:55,470
prints which is which also is fine on

00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:58,020
some prints like this one I wouldn't

00:40:55,470 --> 00:41:00,720
want to have sloppy sloppy on the color

00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:03,630
changes but like if I was making a if I

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,850
was printing like sculptures with like

00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:07,230
of dogs or something I probably wouldn't

00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:09,510
care and there's another one that I've

00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:11,910
seen a company working on at least one

00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:13,980
company working on mixing filaments so

00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,900
they have a four color head and they mix

00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,610
the filaments inside I don't know how

00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,800
that would work I'm trying to imagine

00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:22,230
how you would get four different

00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,930
pigments to mix inside of the the melt

00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:27,600
chamber of a hot end and I can't I mean

00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:34,790
ah the hot end on a the 3d printer is a

00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:34,790
