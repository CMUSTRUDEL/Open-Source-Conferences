	Update 2019-06-17: I'm giving this talk a new title, O(fun) in Perl 6. I am still going to talk about most of the things mentioned in my original synopsis, except not HTTP/3 because I haven't made time to wrap my mind around that topic yet. However, I was trying to finish up my slides and I was getting bored building the presentation and that's a bad sign. Instead, I'm going to do an even MOAR FUNNER presentation with bad grammar and hopefully some horrifying jokes thrown in and a light art display/hat, and a Big Red DON'T PUSH THE BUTTON button. Anyway, forgive my late chnage, but it needed to be made. Cheers.

This talk is primarily going to look at the P6WAPI specification, which I'm hoping to have drafted HTTP/3 support into by June, and Smack, the reference implementation, which should be released any time. I will be contrasting this against PSGI to show how async is central to this specification while preserving PSGI's familiarity. If time allows, I would like to also contrast it with Cro to compare the design trade-offs each system has made.
