hi my name is Jim Keenan and children

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,160
I'm gonna tell you what it was like back

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,019
in the day the days of early ab c--'s

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,080
laptops were expensive this was before

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,900
Apple introduced the iBook and the power

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:24,060
book and many people came to yep see

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:28,830
without laptops myself included so the

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:32,430
organizers of yep C's in 99 2000 2001 at

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,280
least had to compensate in the various

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,070
rooms that would take in which lectures

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,170
would take place they would usually set

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,170
up a Windows laptop a Windows desktop

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,899
computer so that people could connect to

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,440
the Internet as part of their talks they

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,780
had to set up computer labs or use the

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:58,699
campus computer labs for hacking

00:00:51,780 --> 00:01:05,129
sessions and I used that at Buffalo in

00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:08,700
Europe and in Montreal in 2001 and they

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,369
also had to make available overhead

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,740
projectors so the people who were

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,150
presenting talks but did not have

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,700
laptops could present slides by the

00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:23,610
1960s technology of overhead projectors

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,710
and that's how I presented my first

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:34,439
lightning talk which is why there are no

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:37,409
slides today so at that time I started

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,630
learning Perl I guess in early 2000 and

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:43,380
a lot of my learning came from

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,960
subscribing to to mailing lists the Perl

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,869
win32 users list at active state comm

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,689
and Perl beginners at yahoo groups

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:54,810
dot-com each of which I subscribed to in

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,610
digests forum now there came a time in

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,909
the spring of 2000 when for some reason

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,490
the active state lists went offline for

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,360
a while and when they returned their

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,580
archives were not available and this

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,679
very frustrated me and so I began to

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,380
write a Perl program to deal with my

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:17,130
frustration I wrote a program to

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:20,250
d archived the daily digest files this

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:23,580
subsequently evolved into a Sipan module

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,320
called mail digest tools which you all

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,460
remember from my talk in this subject at

00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,260
UFC buffalo in 2004 but I don't

00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:36,660
recommend you use that module but

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:40,860
eventually I built up on my my Windows

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,990
desktop at home 4000 files one for each

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,600
mailing list thread containing over

00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:48,240
12,000 postings from the two mailing

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,080
lists and I was very proud of this

00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,630
program and I asked myself well what

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,760
good is this program well in the two

00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:01,680
weeks prior to yep see na Montreal in

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,690
2001 I was able to conduct an

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,690
interesting bit of research about the

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,000
purl community itself by using my

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,370
archive of those 4,000 third files

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,400
containing over 12,000 postings from the

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:19,260
two digests and in late May of 2001

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,220
Casey West wrote an article on pearl

00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,620
calm called

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,830
turning the tide on Pearl's attitude

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:29,610
toward beginners and he wrote that the

00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:33,360
pearl community has held tight to a zero

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,390
tolerance policy for beginners he cited

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,800
the hostile attitude beginners face when

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:42,300
I mean when inadvertently posing

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,670
questions that have been asked before

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:52,260
only to be flamed in order to go our T F

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:54,000
M well I wondered whether the problem

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,560
West described might be found in some

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,020
parts of the community but not in others

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,180
the two pearl mailing lists to which I

00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,430
subscribed our remarkably were

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,410
remarkably flame free and I had never

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,770
personally experienced hostility when

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,600
posting to them i hypothesized that a

00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,070
crude measure of a particular mailing

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,700
lists incivility would be how frequently

00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:19,560
RTFM appeared on postings to the list

00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,900
with my archives i was able to test this

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,200
hypothesis I wrote a Perl program which

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,240
located each instance of RT RTFM and its

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,789
and extracted the offending line

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,039
of text I then eyeball the data to

00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:34,199
eliminate cases where RTFM was quoted in

00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:37,380
the reply to a message this left only

00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,349
original met uses of RTFM in posting to

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,680
these lists the sand index of a

00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:46,289
particular mailing lists incivility the

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,090
results by this crude measure the tone

00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:51,169
of the discussion on these two purl

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,900
mailing lists appeared remarkably civil

00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:59,580
RTFM appeared in fewer than 1% of all

00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:02,580
postings now like KC West KC TPC is in

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,990
Pittsburgh where are you like KC you may

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,470
feel that other parts of the Pearl

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,340
community are or were in 2001 hostile to

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,980
beginners but in certain corners

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:19,309
civility rules thank you

00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,309
