Publication date: 2019-06-20
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	A quick survey in what's new with Dart and Flutter, especially the announcements of Flutter for Web and Desktop, and easier UI building with Dart.  I'm a Google Developer Expert for Dart and Flutter, so I've been tracking this very carefully.

my slides okay well let's consider

00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,080
aren't any don't worry about it

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,880
so last year I gave me lightning talk on

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,860
how to use flutter the new rule

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,349
development language and I need a five

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,490
minute demo I'm not doing a demo today

00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:15,960
and two years ago I talked about why

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,970
dart should be an expert at my language

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,060
well I want to report some progress

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,100
since last year so again just for those

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,199
who weren't last year's talk started as

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,599
an SDK to build high performance apps on

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,510
iOS and Android compiling down to native

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,520
arm code that's there no slides I said

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:40,800
there were no slides who wasn't

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:42,770
listening who wasn't listening at that

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,430
time doesn't count that time doesn't go

00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,969
so just imagine this in your head come

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,980
on

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,870
so flutter programs are basically dart

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,610
code for the common ports I wasn't

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,350
Android at this point Plus platform

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,120
channels in the native languages you can

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,129
access everything on the device there's

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,260
no limitations to what dart can do on a

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,730
given a modern platform but since last

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,739
year's five-minute live demo

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,689
I've been approved as a dart flutter

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,130
Google developer expert this is really

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,220
an honor there's like 40 of us in the

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,650
world so yeah sorry represent to the

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,950
world dart and flutter as a non Google

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,360
employee so over 4,500 packages in the

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,950
pub right now that's like Perl Sipan

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,110
that's huge it just keeps growing every

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,020
day there are thousands of flutter apps

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,909
in the stores it's all widgets comm

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,470
lists over 650 but those are all just

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,689
the self-reported ones but I know

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,520
personally from my inside contacts

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,369
there's at least 1,200 just in the

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,320
Google Play Store a footer has gone 1.0

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,460
in December and that really raised a lot

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,650
of interest for it because finally it

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,990
was out of the three year beta and then

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,090
1.5 just last month and 1.5 introduces

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,009
much more complete set of material and

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,450
cupertino widgets you can really get a

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,439
lot of flexibility in how you do your

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:55,290
layout dark went from 2.0 strong dart

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,729
has gun 2.0 has strong sound typing no

00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,610
more loosey-goosey typing like two years

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:02,340
ago and then 2.3 added easier collection

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,570
initialization and the dart for web and

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,649
dart for the server just keeps getting

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,840
better and better Google's really

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,819
working hard on this desktop flutter

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,979
that was something we always saw a demo

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,730
back in December but it went to

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,290
Developer Preview last month

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,900
this is really cool so think of an

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,220
electron but with a sane language very

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,930
very important right

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,150
it supports Linux Mac and Windows and

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,980
hot restart but not have reload yet

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,170
they're working on that flutter for web

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,150
and this was also demoed last December

00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:32,590
but if you develop a preview last month

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:34,720
the demo the apps will run in all modern

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,040
browsers but built with flutter code not

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,549
angular dart which was the other way to

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,599
do it and fuchsia was also mentioned

00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:41,920
last month this was sort of this

00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,239
background project that we don't really

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,340
know much about but it was actually

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,530
announced at this Google conference so

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,700
they are moving forward the nice thing

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,680
about fuchsia is it's going to be

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,629
supported by flutter it can also run

00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,879
Android apps but it's also a microkernel

00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:56,170
and gets away from Linux entirely so no

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,750
more dependency on Java

00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,459
really cool and a lot of that's because

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,109
there's this thing going on between

00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,480
Oracle and Google and they're trying to

00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:05,739
get away from Java everywhere so at

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,209
least that's my suspicion now and I'm

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,299
like I can't tell you guys I'm under an

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:11,680
NDA but yeah that's my suspicion so the

00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:13,329
nice thing about this is this is clutter

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,950
everywhere these programs can be ported

00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:17,620
across all platforms with minimal

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,359
changes and pixel perfect parity so you

00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,919
see exactly the same thing on iOS and

00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:23,470
Android and now the web and now the

00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,569
desktop it's really really slick and the

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,950
dart and flutter plug-ins for IntelliJ

00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:28,989
Android studio and vs code are

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,010
continuously improved so in summer I'm

00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:31,930
just going to say it's a really great

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,389
time to look at dart and flutter sea

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,489
dart dev and flutter dev go go bot the

00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:38,620
dot dev domain so all their web sites

00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,840
are moving towards it's really fun and

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,160
if you have any questions ask me or go

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,599
to those other two websites and there

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,280
are links there to get or and things

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,409
like that thank you

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,409
