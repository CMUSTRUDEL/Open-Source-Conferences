I'm really really proud that nobody else

00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,020
lights um welcome to digging in the dirt

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:10,860
thank you lessons learned about land

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:14,130
scraping hi I'm John I go by Jean heck

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:19,220
on line and back in the spring of 2017 I

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:23,039
made a mistake I made a huge mistake I

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,420
decided to start a garden so I had a

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,859
section of my yard that looked a lot

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,480
like this unfortunately I didn't take a

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,220
picture of the exact section before I

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,599
started with the huge mistake but it

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,820
looked basically like this it was nice

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,469
and flat it has great southern exposure

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,860
and I live in Oregon where during this

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,170
summer we get like 16 hours of Sun a day

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,540
that's amazing so I asked my lawn crew

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,250
to rototill out three beds in this

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,559
great-looking section of my yard and I

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,230
had visions of this area of my yard

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,590
transformed into a lush garden full of

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,530
tomatoes full of all the tomatoes I love

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,510
Tomatoes what I didn't know was that the

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:02,520
previous owners of my house were

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,979
 specifically they were

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,729
landscape fabric loving

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,740
I hate landscape fabric like with a

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,930
white-hot passion it is perhaps the

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,250
least favorite thing in my universe so

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,710
what actually looked like this nice

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,680
healthy patch of dirt and grass was

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,009
actually very little dirt covering up a

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,080
whole bunch of rocks and quite a bit of

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,030
Satan's favorite landscape fabric you

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,189
can't tell from this picture but this

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,900
stuff actually has some texture to it so

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,820
it's not the same thickness and it

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,619
basically has no lateral integrity at

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,549
all if you tug on it from the side it

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:45,540
shreds so I've spent the past couple of

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:46,920
years digging out from this mistake with

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,829
some feet with some detours along the

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,470
way and along the way I had plenty of

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:55,600
time to think about software development

00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,160
I don't know what you guys think about

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,560
when you're digging in the dirt but I

00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,180
tend to think about software development

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,710
so lessons I've learned about software

00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,650
development or things I've reflected

00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:12,580
upon first landscape fabric is technical

00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:14,140
debt for your yard don't put it in it

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,240
doesn't work it will make things look

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,740
nice for like one season and stuff grows

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,510
right through it you see all those holes

00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,440
that's where the stuff grew through it

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,170
it's pointless

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,820
second in addition to liking landscape

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,500
fabric the previous owners were also

00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,750
extraordinarily fond of ornamental

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,180
bamboos of a species that I happen to be

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,950
really allergic to you

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,600
that's one clump of ornamental bamboos

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,430
that was in between the most convenient

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,610
paths between the garden and where the

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,230
rocks needed to go so sometimes along

00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,850
the way before you can make the change

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,410
you want before you can refactor that

00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,450
code or introduce that new matcha well

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:51,100
you need to remove some other problem

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:52,990
that took about a month do not

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,730
underestimate the satisfaction you will

00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,750
get from doing this and don't listen to

00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,850
people who tell you it's impossible

00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,870
because if the bamboo is actually dug

00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:04,239
out it hasn't come back yet

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,860
mostly knock on wood third substantial

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,470
projects will take much longer than you

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,940
expect this is my garage and office my

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,650
house is actually over here this is a

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,510
shot from Google Maps this has gone on

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:17,200
for long enough that it's actually on

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:20,980
Google Maps like that's where I'm

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,510
digging out that brown anyway forth you

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,430
might need to build some specialized

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,540
tools so if you're doing a refactoring

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,920
or something you might need to write a

00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,019
little bit of code that's just a helper

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,519
code this is something I made it's

00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:33,010
called a soil sifter you know how you

00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,110
get rocks out of dirt you pour them in

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,400
here and you shake it back and forth and

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,430
all the dirt falls out the bottom of

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,730
them the rocks are in the top I'll build

00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:46,269
you one of these at fifth make sure you

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,709
have the proper equipment good quality

00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,920
equipment I've gone through about three

00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:54,870
pairs of gloves at this point and

00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,870
equipment is important at all times

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,819
this is what happens if you go out on

00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,739
the first day of spring and do a whole

00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,629
lot of work wearing a ballcap while

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:11,590
you're facing pretty much straight West

00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:16,690
as the Sun comes up behind you I slept

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,320
on my face for a while finally stick

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,900
with it

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,280
I got done it's all dug out I have to

00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,009
fill it back in still but it's all dug

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,990
out don't give up this is the rock that

00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:28,360
I extracted from that patch of dirt

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,710
those are 5 gallon buckets for those of

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,520
you know how big they are that's a 12

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:35,199
foot long 2x4 in front of that pile this

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,539
is all River Rock that shit's expensive

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:44,500
they buried it I don't know what they

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:47,130
were thinking Thanks this is my dog you

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,130
