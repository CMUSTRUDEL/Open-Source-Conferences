Description: 
	Maybe Perl can takeover a new niche: quilting

okay so this is maybe a new niche that

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:11,130
pearl can get into it's making quilts so

00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:14,280
you this started just as making a

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,859
qr-code out of a quilt and it's kind of

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,490
important to keep the size nice here so

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,800
this one it just says quilt and you

00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:25,400
don't want too long of a message because

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,199
you'll do this and each of those little

00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,789
blocks of color is going to be another

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,149
piece of fabric that has to be stitched

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:35,790
together so this one by the way is a

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,770
Quine it actually outputs the source

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,770
code to the Perl script that created it

00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,370
but don't do that don't try to make a

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,410
quilt out of that unless you're from

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,270
Japan where they make crazy detailed

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,090
quilts like this I don't know how long

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,920
that took to put together but it yeah

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,750
you don't want to do that but the actual

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,079
source code to this you know it's just

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,640
kind of a basic QR code generator just

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,949
keep the size nice you probably want to

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,290
keep the redundancy inside the cue card

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,750
code kind of high because if it's a

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,460
physical object it has you know kind of

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,560
analog air to it so you want a little

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,720
bit more redundancy than usual but

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,270
otherwise light and dark colors are set

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,900
here because making it a nice black and

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,960
white makes it a little easier to

00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:24,600
transfer this later to the quilt design

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,680
otherwise nothing too special and now

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,119
I'm going to turn this over to my wife

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,119
who actually made the thing hi so when I

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,700
was making this project I wound up using

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,829
a bitmap image of the original QR code

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,750
and enlarged it just so I could get an

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,060
idea as to what size each shape was

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,950
going to be piece it all together I did

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,630
find that I could use any color I wanted

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,140
for the background so long as I used

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,350
black in the forgo foreground so I've

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,229
noticed have Tim help me show the quilt

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,420
right now but before I do that the

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,000
reason this happened was because someone

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,240
at our makerspace wanted to label

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,009
everything with a QR code so I decided

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,009
to label the quilt too

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:28,350
and it does work yeah it does work all

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,350
