Description: 
	Git is an almost ubiquitous feature of modern Open Source software development -- the few OSS projects that use revision control software that _isn't_ Git are the exception that proves thes rule. In addition to this near universal adoption, Git is noteworthy for the extent to which many people completely dread having to use it. Are you consumed by "Git anxiety"? Do you come away from coding sessions feeling "Git stupid"? Come to this talk and learn a few helpful tips and tricks that will allow you to Git happy. I'll present a wide number of tricks and approaches that will allow you to work more effectively with Git, more quickly, and overall, with less Git drama. (Note: some Git experience will be expected, but if you can make a commit, you'll be able to keep up just fine!)
