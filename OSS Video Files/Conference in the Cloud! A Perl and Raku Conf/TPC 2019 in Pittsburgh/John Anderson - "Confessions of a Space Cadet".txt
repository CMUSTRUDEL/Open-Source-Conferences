Title: John Anderson - "Confessions of a Space Cadet"
Publication date: 2019-06-18
Playlist: TPC 2019 in Pittsburgh
Description: 
	Folks in IT spend a tremendous amount of time every day working on their keyboards -- writing code, updating tickets, sending emails, building out project plans -- but most of us don't give any thought to how we use that keyboard. This talk will cover a number of keyboarding changes you can make that enable more effective keyboarding -- changes that will potentially reduce the negative consequences of over-use of traditional keyboards. We'll also explore the fantastic range of keyboard customizations that are available today with custom programmable keyboard firmwares.

hey it's 9 o'clock hi I'm John I and I'm

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,469
a bit of a keyboard nerd when anybody

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,809
else in the room like to out themselves

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,490
as a keyboard nerd at this point we got

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,070
a couple of three four brave individuals

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,279
so you might be wondering how could I

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,029
become a keyboard a nerd do so today I'm

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,830
going to talk a little bit about

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,170
keyboard memory and how you might be

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,269
able to get into it but first let's talk

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,830
about how I ended up becoming a keyboard

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,910
nerd in the first place because I wasn't

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,860
born one I became one and contrary to

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,630
what you might think I didn't turn into

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,530
a keyboard nerd because I was trying to

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,329
type faster you might be surprised to

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,460
learn this hopefully not but you might

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,730
be surprised it turns out keyboards are

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,739
bad for you so this is the health

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,329
warning that Microsoft started putting

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,219
on there ergonomic keyboards in the

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,710
early 2000s and people kind of freaked

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,239
out and this is only half of it it was

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,550
actually so long it they needed two

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,870
stickers for like the other part people

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,490
freaked out a little bit about this at

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,439
the time so more specifically what's bad

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,020
for you is long periods of typing on

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,000
keyboards and it's not actually keyboard

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,650
specifically it's anything involving

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,270
long sessions of repetitive finger

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,220
movements is eventually going to cause

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,170
you problems evolution did not like

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,790
nothing about waving around like this

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,960
helps you run away from the Lions so

00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,400
different people are different and are

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,810
affected at different rates and maybe

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,180
you're one of the lucky people that is a

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,560
less affected by this problem but if

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,229
you're intending to do this programming

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,610
thing for 30 40 50 years this is

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,930
probably gonna catch up to you sooner or

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,450
later so you might as well start

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,159
thinking about what you can do now this

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,930
shouldn't be news to anybody people have

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,820
been saying this for long periods of

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,520
time this is from an essay that was

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,659
written in 1999 by Neal Stephenson

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,689
called in the beginning was the command

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,840
line and he's talking about the top

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,920
level directory is in a UNIX file system

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,290
note the obsessive use of abbreviations

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,000
and avoidance of capital letters this is

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,920
a system invented by people to whom

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,760
repetitive stress disorder is what black

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,640
lung is

00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:13,380
miners so the TLDR is my interest in

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,780
this topic was kick-started due to some

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,880
issues I had due to bad typing habits in

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,770
graduate school I kind of screwed up my

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,450
wrists because I was doing a lot of

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,320
typing an extremely bad

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:29,220
ergonomic situation I got scared I made

00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:32,250
some pretty drastic readjustments - that

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,660
seemed to work ironically given the next

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,580
slide I didn't ever actually see a

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,470
physician but this is the beginning of

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,860
my interest in keyboards and alternative

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,920
keyboard systems and stuff obligatory

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:46,110
disclaimer I am NOT a physician I do not

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,210
even play a physician on the Internet

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,610
nothing I say in this talk should be

00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:53,550
taken as health advice or medical advice

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,800
if your wrists arms shoulders neck or

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,320
anything else hurts after you use a

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,450
keyboard particularly if that happens

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,400
with any sort of regularity you should

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,470
see an actual physician as soon as

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,950
possible about that problem it's not

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:10,709
just going to go away by itself all

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,570
right so let's talk about the actual

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,180
keyboard nerdery I think you could break

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,130
this down into three specific areas and

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,620
some folks managed to contain their

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,030
obsession - one or two of these but most

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,760
people who've been involved in this tend

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,380
to kind of eventually go into all three

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,450
so the first one is P layouts the

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,760
overall arrangement of keys on the

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,670
keyboard the second one is the actual

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,980
keyboard hardware itself and then the

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,900
third one is custom key bindings that

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,430
people layer on top of their basic key

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,500
layout these could end up being

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,630
extremely idiosyncratic and they're

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,430
probably one of my favorite parts of

00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,980
this whole subculture so we're going to

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,970
talk about each one of these in turn so

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,920
alternative layouts first the non

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,680
alternative layout Cordy this is like

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,260
the OG layout everybody is familiar with

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,930
this right this layout was actually

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:04,230
designed to work around constraints of

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,740
the original mechanical typewriters this

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,790
is a typewriter those of you heard

00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,770
maybe a little bit younger may not

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,270
recognize this but this is mechanical

00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,340
typewriter it's and Underwood's one of

00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:17,770
the classics and the way these worked

00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,989
was these keys are actually physically

00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:22,000
connected to these little bits of type

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:23,980
and when you hit one of those keys it

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,110
would actuate a lever mechanism that

00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:29,020
would cause that arm to fly up and smack

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,370
the paper through a carbon ribbon that

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,980
would then leave an imprint of the

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,970
letter on it

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,440
who's actually typed on one of these

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,810
like an actual honest-to-god McKee

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,690
manual typewriter most of the room Wow

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:44,650
cool it's hard right like you have to

00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:46,810
hit those keys pretty freaking hard so

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,960
the thing is because those arms are like

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,270
flying up and because they're physically

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,010
attached to these keys if you hit two

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,320
keys that are close to each other in

00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,360
rapid succession those type arms could

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:03,190
like conflict with each other and they

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:05,080
would get jammed and this sucked so it

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,910
happened more often if you typed more

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,710
quickly and if you were typing more

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,230
quickly on keys that were close to each

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,960
other so one of the things with the

00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:16,240
original QWERTY layout was they wanted

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,430
to physically spread keys that you might

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,260
hit in succession pretty far apart which

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:25,270
leads to you moving your hands around a

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:27,400
lot as you type English there's also an

00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,900
apocryphal story that the reason for

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,880
this layout was because it allowed the

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,130
sales people to type typewriter quote

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,810
very quickly because all the letters you

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:40,690
need for that are all in the type of the

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:42,100
top row why are we still using this

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,160
layout why are we still teaching this

00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,110
layout in school one inertia and two

00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,880
because no one has actually been able to

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,310
conclusively demonstrate that any other

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,170
layout is actually better in a properly

00:05:51,310 --> 00:06:00,340
controlled scientific test whose type

00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:02,860
sporty like pretty much 80% of the room

00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,510
all right now you know the alternative

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:09,460
layouts Dvorak this is the Dvorak layout

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,620
so you might notice all the vowels are

00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,370
over here altogether underneath the

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,370
letters of your left hand

00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:20,569
the position of keys across the rows is

00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:22,819
actually based on letter frequency use

00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:24,469
in English language so the most

00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:27,409
frequently used letters are all on the

00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:29,719
home row the second most frequently used

00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:31,759
keys are on the top row because it's

00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:33,499
easier to reach forward than it is to

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,879
curl your fingers inward and so the

00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:37,520
bottom row is reserved for things that

00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:40,249
are used less frequently it's also

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,009
designed and keys are positioned so that

00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:44,809
most typing of English words which tend

00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:47,839
to alternate in a vowel consonant vowel

00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:49,279
consonant type pattern so this is set up

00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,499
so that most of the time you're going

00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,960
back and forth when you're typing left

00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:55,249
hand right hand left hand right hand the

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,080
idea is that that's going to reduce

00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:59,479
fatigue because you're using your hands

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:03,110
more more evenly and will also reduce

00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:05,270
errors in the QWERTY layout something

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,210
like sixty to seventy percent of the key

00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:10,969
usage is on your right hand

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:15,020
anyway Tec Dvorak I type Dvorak a couple

00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:16,789
of people interestingly the Auguste

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,469
Dvorak who's the person who came up with

00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:21,289
this layout went on and did a lot more

00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:23,509
keyboard research he never was able to

00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:25,639
conclusively prove in a study well there

00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:29,169
was never a study that wasn't done by

00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,610
him that showed that Dvorak was better

00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:32,779
but he did do a little bit of research

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,839
and a little bit of work and came up

00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:38,360
with layouts designed for people who

00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,550
only have the use of one hand so there's

00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,749
a left-handed Dvorak layout just kind of

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,860
interesting because it moves the numbers

00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:47,620
off the top row onto the side here and

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,120
there's also a corresponding right-hand

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,939
layout which is almost the mirror

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,339
inverse of the left hand one with a few

00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:58,490
variations so the thing here is the the

00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:59,899
numbers are all on the left side which

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,339
would be sort of the less frequently

00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:03,589
used side if you only had your right

00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:05,479
hand and if they're arranged like a

00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:07,909
normal number keypad if you look at the

00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,849
left-handed one its reversed and in

00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:12,589
particular this really seems to tweak

00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:15,969
people out that the parentheses are are

00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:15,969
facing away from each other

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,860
and then finally there's a third layout

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,680
that's becoming more and more popular

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,780
these days it's called colemak it was

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,389
designed to sort of bridge the gap

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,449
between accordion an alternative way out

00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:33,039
so if mu it moves fewer Keys around then

00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:35,080
QWERTY it's supposed to be easier to

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,360
learn if you already know how to touch

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,250
type QWERTY but other than that the

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,010
design criteria were very similar to the

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,320
Dvorak keys are arranged by frequency of

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:49,240
use in English anybody type Commack in

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,920
the room one person yeah cool all right

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,750
so if you're looking to sort of reduce

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,880
the amount of damage and stress caused

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,830
by typing switching to a non QWERTY

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,330
layout is one of the cheapest things you

00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,000
can do because it's built into your

00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,220
operating system and it's it's not that

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,760
hard it's kind of fun for your brain it

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:11,050
took me about 2 weeks with a layout of

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:14,350
the Dvorak Keys taped to the front of my

00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:19,660
monitor to get back to close to where I

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:22,560
was at QWERTY all right second dimension

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:25,900
weird keyboards

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,820
so most people's first introduction to

00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,130
weird keyboards is a split or an

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,500
ergonomic keyboard who uses an ergonomic

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,529
and a split keyboard only one person how

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,930
surprising so these are like standard

00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:40,209
keyboards and that they still have

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,560
staggered key positions the other thing

00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:42,750
if you are looking to buy one of these

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,370
that you might want to watch out for

00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:50,080
it's surprisingly contentious on which

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:51,910
side of the gap the six goes and like

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,740
think about which finger you use to hit

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,709
the six it's probably your index finger

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,240
if you're touch typing but which one and

00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:01,350
some keys some keyboards will put it on

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,970
the lefts and will put it on the right

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,040
the Kinesis freestyle is kind of the

00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,140
apotheosis of the split keyboard style

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,910
you can completely the two halves are

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,160
completely independent they're connected

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,660
by a short cable but you can physician

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,800
them or tent them in completely

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:23,739
independently some people may take this

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:26,949
a little bit too far I've also seen a

00:10:23,739 --> 00:10:29,290
lot of pictures of people who mount that

00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:31,569
you have on the arms of an office chair

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,649
and run a longer cable around the back

00:10:31,569 --> 00:10:35,199
to connect them

00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:37,509
most of the weird keyboards you will see

00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:39,009
are what's called ortho linear keyboards

00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:40,360
so basically instead of having that

00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:44,920
staggered layout that you're familiar

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,269
with keys are aligned in a grid this is

00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,309
one of the original ortho linear

00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:50,199
keyboards it's called the mall Tron it

00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:52,809
was invented by Lillian malt and Stephen

00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:55,480
Hobday in the 70s and it was the first

00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:57,160
keyboard to use this bowl kind of layout

00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,629
where the keys are arranged in a bowl

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,459
because again it's thought to be easier

00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:03,309
to reach out and down than to curl your

00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:06,129
fingers in so and then reach your

00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:09,869
fingers back the keys in the middle here

00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:12,879
are some F keys and the number keypad

00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:15,579
they also have a version with an attract

00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,689
ball right here the Caesars cherry MX

00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:18,549
which is if you don't know what those

00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:20,559
are we'll talk about that later this

00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:22,149
will run you around 500 bucks they still

00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,790
make these you can buy one of these

00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,679
fresh anybody drive one of these I've

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,189
only seen one or two in the wild nobody

00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,779
all right

00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:30,689
this is what the keyboard layout looks

00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:32,860
like they also had to invent their own

00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:35,230
keyboard layout because of course you do

00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,759
this is called the vault layout the

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:40,179
keyboard actually supports QWERTY and

00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:42,040
Dvorak in the firmware as well but the I

00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:43,209
don't know what the logic was behind the

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,369
positioning I find in ink

00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:47,230
so the the part of the reason of these

00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:49,329
thumb clusters the idea your thumbs are

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,160
actually your strongest fingers so only

00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:53,110
using them to hit the spacebar is kind

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,209
of silly right so a lot of these

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,829
keyboards will place more keys so they

00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:58,149
can be used by the thumbs the

00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:02,369
interesting thing about the malt layout

00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:02,369
is they put the eeyah on a thumb key

00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:07,899
like they didn't put function on a thumb

00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:10,089
key they didn't you know they didn't put

00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:14,470
shift down on a thumb key it just

00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:17,230
strikes me as odd this is a Kinesis

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:20,319
advantage obviously inspired by the mall

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,369
Tron also an ortho linearlayout also has

00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:24,459
keys and balls

00:12:21,369 --> 00:12:25,809
it also has thumb clusters this will run

00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:28,509
you about three hundred dollars you can

00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:28,810
buy one of these today off of Amazon and

00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:30,580
you

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,590
use one of these I used to drive one of

00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,270
these they're awesome

00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:37,900
it's a it's a pretty great overall

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:39,040
keyboard ships with the default QWERTY

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,920
layout but here you can see we got

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,190
backspace delete return and space

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,110
control alt all on this thumb cluster

00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,520
which is actually once you start using

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,339
this and get used to it it's pretty

00:12:48,520 --> 00:13:04,029
revolutionary the Kinesis also supports

00:12:51,339 --> 00:13:05,830
optional foot pedals and then there are

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:07,630
also a number of popular keyboards that

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,029
are usually sold as kits that you have

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,830
to solder together yourself one of the

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:14,650
first of these types of kits to get

00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,540
popular it was called the ergo docks and

00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,920
somebody is now actually selling fully

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,160
assembled ones that's called the eart or

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,440
docks easy if you don't really feel like

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,550
soldering 87 service mount diodes by

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,050
hand

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:31,000
anybody use an ergonomics nobody Wow and

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,280
then I just recently saw this I saw this

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,260
on Monday it's a new kit it's called an

00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,470
iris it's her like a step-down version

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,760
of the ergo docks that has fewer keys as

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:44,500
far as I know it's only available as a

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,900
kit I had to include this keyboard just

00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,820
because it's so weird this is called the

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,560
data hand they were commercially

00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,180
distributed around the turn of the

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,950
century as far as I know they haven't

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,200
built and do one of these for about ten

00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,089
years each one of these little so you

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,610
put your fingers and your thumb in these

00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:02,830
little pods and each one of those is

00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,140
actually five different switches so

00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,030
pressing pressing down is a switch and

00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,040
then moving in the four up-down

00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,530
left-right cardinal directions is each a

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,510
separate switch see the idea was you

00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:16,420
could type without ever having to move

00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:18,040
your wrists all the movement was just in

00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,970
your fingers and it was very minimal

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,290
movement anybody ever used one of these

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,810
anybody ever seen one of these I've seen

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,220
exactly one there was a assistant min

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,959
when I was in graduate school that had

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,499
one of these and I always wanted to use

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:35,509
it but I was never brave enough to ask

00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:37,129
this is how the key layout worked so

00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:40,129
anything in green which is hard to see

00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:45,379
on the screen is a normal press anything

00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:47,480
in yellow is a cord with this the left

00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:49,249
thumb basically acted like an

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,639
alternative kind of shift key or a layer

00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:55,610
key to get you the green and then the

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:59,209
right thumb was the function which give

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:02,179
you the red so again you can see common

00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:05,360
ideas here right return tab backspace

00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:09,009
space all on the thumb keys really

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,999
common things sticking with the thumbs

00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,920
imagine folks are familiar with this

00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:14,360
this is called the keyboard IO was

00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,490
developed by someone you may have heard

00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,550
of called Jesse Benson with his partner

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,139
key at Decca here Decker this is an

00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,689
ortho linear keyboard as well but it's

00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:25,699
flat and the fun thing about the

00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,709
keyboard IO is it is fully open source

00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:29,480
hardware and firmware you can get the

00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:31,490
schema as you can get the PCB layouts on

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,009
their website this one will run you

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,869
around $300 anybody using one of these

00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:38,089
I've switched to one of these a couple

00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:41,269
of years ago or when it when it came out

00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:42,860
and it's pretty awesome one of the most

00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:45,619
distinctive things about the keyboard IO

00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,420
is that each half of the keyboard has

00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:49,549
these thumb clusters so there's four

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,679
keys under your thumb and there's also a

00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:53,600
big button which you can't really see

00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,069
very well in that picture these buttons

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,139
right here called palm switches so

00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:59,059
that's right where your palm rests and

00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:02,509
you actually press that key by pressing

00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:04,790
down with the heel of your palm in the

00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:06,679
default layout that they ship that works

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,509
as a what's called an FN key which

00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,279
shifts you to a different layer it's

00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,779
conceptually like a shift key just

00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,939
changes the meaning of some of the keys

00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:15,079
on the keyboard so one of the other fun

00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,910
things about this keyboard it is

00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:19,399
actually has a mouse emulation built-in

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:22,399
so if you hold down that FN key on the

00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:27,619
default layout the the WASD cluster

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:30,939
turns into moving your mouse around so

00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,939
you don't actually need a separate Mouse

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,360
one of the frustrating things about this

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:39,769
keyboard as a programmer is they don't

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:44,589
have quite enough keys so pipe and

00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:44,589
backslash are actually on that FN layer

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:50,010
and then finally just because we're

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,780
talking about weird keywords I have to

00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,130
show a few more other or interesting

00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:57,000
ortho linear ones this is called the

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:59,000
prion ik 60 key is heavily layer-based

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,230
like there are multiple layers of this

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,520
keyboard basically multiple shift keys

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,980
that do different things

00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:08,010
if 60 keys is too many for you there's

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,800
another version called the plank that's

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:14,699
48 keys again heavily layer-based

00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:18,449
and then I subscribe to an enthusiast

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:20,130
site that does mass purchases of weird

00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:22,890
keyboards this showed up in my email the

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,800
other day this is a 75 key full Earth or

00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:27,900
linear flat keyboard and interestingly

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,250
to take us back to the Malter on the

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,840
middle set of keys here I don't know if

00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,630
you can see that in the back but that

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,390
set up is a number keypad in the middle

00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,760
any plank Prien accusers anybody

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,350
actually dropped oh wow cool how does

00:17:38,760 --> 00:18:01,800
that work for you I've got one but I

00:17:40,350 --> 00:18:04,860
could never get into it yeah cool

00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,680
all right so custom keyboards are not

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:10,050
cheap but they can be a really great

00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,970
investment considering that they usually

00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,640
have mechanical switches they will last

00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,110
for a very very long time and it's

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,660
probably something you use pretty

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:20,010
frequently if you're a programmer if you

00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,740
want to get into hand soldering air and

00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:25,500
keyboards like that's that's on you but

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,630
people need hobbies quick plug for a

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,700
couple of good introductory mechanical

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,380
keyboards that are not terribly

00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,420
expensive if you're interested in seeing

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,490
whether you'd like to sort of dip a toe

00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,370
into this world this is called the code

00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:40,290
keyboard it was developed by Jeff Atwood

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:43,410
working with a keyboard manufacturer

00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:46,050
called WASD who's well-regarded in the

00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,760
space it's available in this is an 87

00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:50,250
key layout sometimes called a tin

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,500
keyless layout because it doesn't have

00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,350
the

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,450
burp ad they also have a standard 104

00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,640
key layout that you're well familiar

00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,500
with it's the standard ansi keyboard

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:04,810
both of them cost around a hundred sixty

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:07,720
bucks this is called an an pro - it's

00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,610
what's called a 60% layout so fewer keys

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,230
the idea here is if the keyword is

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,620
smaller you're moving your hands around

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:16,690
less and that's better for you this is

00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,670
also a Bluetooth keyboard so you can

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:21,490
pair this with a tablet or with a phone

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:24,430
I know of at least one person who's not

00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:27,400
in the room whose daily driver is an

00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:31,740
iPad paired with one of these and he

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:34,840
does web development with that system

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,820
you will need to get used to using

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,160
layers these two keys right here that

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,410
have wind key caps on them are actually

00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,760
two different layer keys if you're close

00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,080
enough you might be able to see that

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,610
that key up in the upper left hand

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,400
corner is labeled escape

00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,750
there's no tilde key out of the box on

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,000
this keyboard you have to use a function

00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:54,850
layer to get tilde anybody using the

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,670
AMPRO - one person I've got one of these

00:19:54,850 --> 00:20:00,610
it's nice and then there are tons of

00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:02,590
other options if those didn't look good

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,410
to you I'm an an pro we'll run you

00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:12,910
around a hundred bucks

00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:15,010
yeah like how many do I all one

00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:18,180
completely or how many are set up that I

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,180
routinely use

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:29,060
it's not a problem it's a collection so

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:33,590
let's let's let's talk about switches

00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:35,030
key switches the most popular type of

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,560
key switches and mechanical keyboards

00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,660
are made by a company called Cherry

00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,640
they're called Cherry MX switches and

00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,470
they come in different flavors which are

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,410
identified by colors so that's a red

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,180
that's a brown that's a blue there are

00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,340
quite a few different specialized

00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,980
varieties and so interesting trivia

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:54,110
factoids usually the spacebar and the

00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,970
return key other large keys will

00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,680
actually use a slightly different kind

00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:00,650
of switch than most of the letter keys

00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,270
in the keyboard because the way you

00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,880
press those is actually slightly

00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:06,050
different generally speaking the most

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,390
popular ones and keyboards will be

00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:10,940
identified by what type of key switches

00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:12,800
under the letter keys the most popular

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:16,160
varieties of choice which is a Reds

00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:19,280
Browns and blues so this is a red switch

00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,620
and this is a graphic that I stole about

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,810
the internet of how the red switch works

00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,460
so as you can see it's going down it

00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,590
moves down smoothly this is what's

00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,050
called a linear switch because it just

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:33,050
the travel down and back up is a

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:35,600
completely linear phenomenon when that

00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:37,250
leaf spring right there makes contact

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,610
with this other spring that's when the

00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:43,970
key press is registered that's called

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:47,150
actuation in the keyboard community and

00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:50,960
the force required to actuate a red

00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:52,760
switch is around 0.45 Newtons that

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,740
doesn't mean anything to anybody don't

00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,710
try to understand what that number means

00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,120
just remember 0.45 to compare it to the

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,310
other switches that I'm about to tell

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,350
you about so that's a red switch it's

00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:08,300
linear it doesn't make any

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,610
there's no clicking there's no tactile

00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:13,010
feedback in a linear switch it just

00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:15,500
moves smoothly up and down this is a

00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:18,770
brown and a brown is what's called a

00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,090
tactile switch if you watch this bit you

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,370
can see there's a part where the leaf

00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:24,890
spring kind of Wiggles around a little

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:26,870
bit the effect of that is there's gonna

00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,430
be a with what's called a tactile bump

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,990
so you can feel that in the key as

00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,290
you're pressing it down it doesn't make

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,350
any noise

00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:37,080
a point where you feel that leaf switch

00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:39,000
bump and that lets you know that the key

00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,100
is actuated and you don't have to push

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,240
the key all the way down one of the

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,440
things that's thought to be bad about

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,350
type thing is you're basically

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,840
constantly slamming your fingers into

00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,130
something and that's not good for you

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,350
keys that actually wait without going

00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,450
without bottoming out thought to be

00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:58,890
better so this is a brown switch it

00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:01,430
actuates at also 0.45 Newtons and then

00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:03,750
finally this is the infamous blue switch

00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:05,130
you're familiar with these switches from

00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,900
that one person in your office who

00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:10,110
everybody hates because it sounds like

00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:12,420
gunfire when they're typing these

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:15,450
actuated a slightly higher rate their

00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:18,240
point five Newtons and the thing that

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:20,730
causes the click actually is right there

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,530
where that bottom part hits the bottom

00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,120
there's also a bump you can see the

00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:26,900
leaves the leaf spring does kind of the

00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:30,090
same thing it does on the Browns and

00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,190
then finally this is the original cookie

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,830
switch it's called the buckling spring

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,600
and all the the cherry switches there is

00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,520
a spring down here but it just moves

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,950
just gets compressed and moves straight

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,290
up and down these key switches which are

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:45,270
infamous for being used in the IBM model

00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:49,080
M keyboard which you know is the really

00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:51,420
clack e keyboard the noise comes from

00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,830
the spring buckling and the actuation

00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,440
actually happens down here with this

00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:57,240
plate which as the spring buckles the

00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,360
plate falls forward and makes contact

00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,040
across these two electrical fits here

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,530
and that's what registers the key being

00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:07,620
pressed actuation force on a buckling

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:10,230
spring key is about 0.7 to 0.8 Newtons

00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,450
so not quite twice as much as most

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,430
modern switches it actually gets less

00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,980
over time because the spring starts to

00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:20,040
get fatigued from being bent like that

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:24,000
and then of course the most important

00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:27,720
part of your mechanical keyboard fancy

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,050
key caps this is just a single example

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,910
of fancy key caps that I found on Flickr

00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:34,410
captioned with when your key caps cost

00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,160
four times the breasts the cost of the

00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,160
rest of your keyboard

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,250
this is the code keyboard that I showed

00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:44,470
earlier this is my code keyboard I

00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,330
didn't actually need this keyboard but I

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,070
bought this set of key caps and I didn't

00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:50,320
have another keyboard to put them on and

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:55,419
they were just too cool to not put on a

00:24:50,320 --> 00:25:03,940
keyboard so key caps are kind of the

00:24:55,419 --> 00:25:05,919
edge of like we're gonna back away third

00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,779
dimension of keyboard memory custom key

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,669
bindings custom key bindings here in the

00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:11,830
sense of changing things either in

00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:13,990
software and your operating system or in

00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:16,149
the keyboard firmware itself so cause a

00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:18,850
key to omit something other than what it

00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:20,669
normally would in courtier Dvorak or

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,620
whatever underlying layout you're using

00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:25,480
so the sort of the ogee of these is

00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,950
changing caps lock back to the control

00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,580
key that it originally was on some

00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:34,059
keyboards who does this half the room

00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:36,039
good this is the vehm version of the OG

00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:38,470
key modification changing caps lock to

00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:40,630
escape who does this a couple of people

00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,700
its became a little bit more popular

00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:46,059
when Apple started shipping the touch

00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,100
bar without a physical Escape key and

00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:50,830
another variety of this is setting up F

00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,840
keys to run particular custom actions or

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,909
otherwise drive more sophisticated

00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,899
things than would be possible in your

00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:58,630
editor

00:25:55,899 --> 00:26:00,789
I've got F key setup in Emacs to do all

00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,649
kinds of stuff that I routinely do that

00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:04,480
would require running Emacs functions

00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:07,289
although to be honest I've been using

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,750
that a lot less since I got a touch bar

00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:13,350
Mac keyboard anybody else do this F key

00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:16,419
stuff one person in the back cool

00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:19,149
finally this is my favorite custom

00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:22,419
keyboard modification proper shift keys

00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:24,700
so you can set up bindings that force

00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:26,440
you to use the left shift key or the

00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,210
right shift key depending on what key

00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,399
you're trying to shift so on all my key

00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:34,929
words if you hold the left shift key and

00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:36,789
hit a nothing happens because it turns

00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:38,500
out you're actually intended to use the

00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:41,080
shift key on the opposite side of the

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:44,019
keyboard from the key or trying to shift

00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,720
up forces you to use two hands and

00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:49,120
prevent you from contorting one hand

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,210
into weird shapes to depress the

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,180
if key might be better for you doesn't

00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:57,250
hurt one thing that this will teach you

00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,830
is the appreciation for actually having

00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,960
a caps lock key because if you want to

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:05,280
shout at somebody you end up having to

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:08,860
go back and forth with the shift keys

00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,540
anybody else do this it's it's I've been

00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,350
doing this for 2 or 3 years it's pretty

00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,830
fantastic

00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:16,570
I recommend it I started doing a lot

00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:19,270
more key binding modification after

00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,350
reading this blog post by Steve lush if

00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,660
you haven't checked it out you should

00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:25,360
it's a few years old but you can find it

00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:28,210
by searching for loesch space-cadet on

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,370
it in this post he talks about this

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:32,230
keyboard it's kind of infamous it's

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:35,380
called the space-cadet keyboard it's the

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:37,900
origin of the name of the talk this was

00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:40,270
used by a type of computer called the

00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:43,270
Symbolics Lisp machine this is one of

00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:45,220
the original like hard cordless machines

00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:47,320
and this is a close-up view this

00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:51,010
keyboard is awesome they've got like

00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:54,309
thumbs-up and thumbs-down keys this is

00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:56,710
the origin of YT max has the notion of

00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:58,990
hyper super meta and control as as

00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,850
modifiers is because they work all on

00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:06,100
this keyboard it's got these Roman

00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:10,290
numeral keys I don't know why what else

00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:12,990
do we have Network terminal quote

00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:15,160
overstrike he's got all these Mechanica

00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:20,620
mathematical symbols like actually on

00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:23,950
the keys probably yeah it's got a - M

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:28,900
and M - key yeah so this keyboard is

00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:30,790
awesome the key insight from Josh's blog

00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,470
posts is that if you look at all the

00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,750
keys on your keyboard they come in three

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:37,690
different varieties there are keys that

00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:40,059
you hold and hold down and press another

00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:42,640
key in combination with so your Shift

00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:45,250
key your control key windows key alt

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,140
whatever there are keys where you hit

00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,240
them and release them but you don't want

00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,559
them to repeat so like if you hit your

00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,210
caps lock key you're never going to hit

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,010
the caps lock key and hold it down to

00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,290
make it repeat you're never gonna hit

00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,390
escape and make it

00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,190
Pete you just hit it and release it and

00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,410
then there are a bunch of keys the

00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,030
letter keys that you hit once and you

00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:06,330
may hold them down because you do want

00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:09,060
them to repeat the key insight the lodge

00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:11,160
had was that those first two types the

00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,230
the hold-down and pressing combination

00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,870
was something else and the hit once and

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:18,320
never repeat the usage pattern of those

00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,820
two types of keys is totally orthogonal

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,310
there's no reason they can't be on the

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,980
same key because you can distinguish

00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,120
which type of meaning you have by

00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,740
whether or not you're holding it down

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,210
and pushing another key in combination

00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:39,750
with it or whether you're just hitting

00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:42,030
and releasing it no but you don't that's

00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:44,160
still just to type one key being pressed

00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,840
in combination with the types you key so

00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,360
there's no reason why you can't set up

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,140
cap clip caps lock to be control and

00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:54,090
escape if you hit it and hold it down

00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,650
and hit another key with it it's control

00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:59,430
if you hit it just once

00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:01,200
it's escape there's no reason why your

00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:03,030
shift keys can't be used for something

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,430
else if you hit just the shift key by

00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,810
itself so all my keyboards if you hit

00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,550
the left shift key and release it you

00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,870
get a left parenthesis if you hit the

00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,540
right shift key and release you get a

00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:18,540
right parenthesis you type parentheses a

00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:20,460
lot and actually on the keyboard IO

00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,490
because they have these four thumb keys

00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,370
that are right next to each other I have

00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:28,590
that set up so that the left arc if you

00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:31,260
hold them down it's shift command

00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:33,540
control if you just hit it and release

00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:39,410
it it's parentheses square bracket curly

00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:42,390
bracket the right arc is the inverse and

00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:44,550
again when you're setting up custom key

00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:46,470
bindings you want to be able to like

00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,030
things that you need to hold down in

00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,440
combination with if you're holding down

00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,990
a key with one hand you should be

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,510
hitting the key combo with the other

00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:56,460
hand so you really want shift command

00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,910
and control on both sides of your

00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,910
keyboard

00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,940
custom keybindings can be a super

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,620
powerful modification and they're also

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,130
fun because they make it impossible for

00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:11,350
other people to type on your keyboard

00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:13,929
my biggest tip with these is when you're

00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:16,120
trying to train yourself on a new one

00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:17,860
when you make a change you have to set

00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,470
it up so that the normal key binding

00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,660
doesn't do anything when I first put

00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,760
parentheses on my shift keys I had to

00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,100
set it up so that shift 9 and shift 0

00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,590
didn't do anything because there will be

00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,300
a period of a few days where your

00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,610
forearms are like oh I need a left

00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,530
parenthesis shift 9 you have to make

00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,790
that not do anything because then

00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:41,559
eventually your forearms are like oh

00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:45,280
right I just hit the shift key in

00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:46,390
conclusion as an IT worker your keyboard

00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,890
is likely to be one of the most

00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:50,500
frequently used tools that you have

00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:51,610
aside from your brain it's worth a

00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,170
little bit of time a little bit of

00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,559
thinking about it and possibly a little

00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:57,880
bit of money to improve how you use it

00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:00,280
especially since doing that incorrectly

00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,530
can have a huge deal it serious effect

00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:05,650
on your body in your career longevity I

00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:08,679
know of at least two people who are

00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:10,090
fairly famous programmers who can't

00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:14,740
really program anymore because they

00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:16,420
can't type so the the long-term

00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:20,080
consequences of doing this wrong are

00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:21,250
potentially pretty severe thanks for

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,890
coming to the talk thanks to the

00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:25,750
organizers for selecting the talk thanks

00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,840
to my employer for sending me here to

00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:30,610
give the talk to you we do custom

00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,100
software development using our fancy

00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:34,679
weirdo keyboards if you need some custom

00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,690
software development come pick me up

00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:39,520
we're also looking for a senior QA

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,020
person and probably a front-end dev in

00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,300
the near future we don't quite have the

00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,830
job Rex written up yet but if that

00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,460
describes you and you're looking for

00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:49,900
work also come hit me up and finally if

00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,610
you're interested in alternative input

00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,020
methods you should make sure to catch

00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,910
the next talk that's happening in this

00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,580
room Emily Shay is gonna give a talk on

00:32:54,910 --> 00:33:00,760
programming via speech recognition which

00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:03,340
I am super excited to hear about and now

00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:06,900
I'm happy to take questions I don't know

00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,900
what the hell with the book cover but

00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:21,940
doudou keycaps make a difference in the

00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:26,350
feel of your typing as well as just look

00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:28,720
in pidgin sometimes there are different

00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:31,000
methods of manufacture of keycaps the

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:36,970
best ones are made using a technique

00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:39,400
called double shot where the the colored

00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:42,250
part with the legend is actually a

00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,920
separate plastic layer so we can ever

00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:47,170
wear off and they can feel a little bit

00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,790
different on the fingers the the higher

00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:50,740
quality ones they don't actually make

00:33:48,790 --> 00:34:07,300
any impact on performance no they just

00:33:50,740 --> 00:34:09,040
look cool are the key bindings at the

00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,310
keyboard level or the operating system

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,590
level yes they can paint both most

00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:17,890
mechanical keyboards so the keyboard IO

00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:20,860
uses a firmware called kaleidoscope that

00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:22,929
Jesse originally developed there's

00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,190
another popular firmware that's used in

00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:26,890
a lot of mechanical keyboards that's

00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:29,320
called qmk and both of those are open

00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:33,070
source the the source is available you

00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:35,440
can put your own key map into code and

00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,820
blow it into the firmware and then it's

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,320
built into the keyboard and it'll work

00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:42,190
with that keyboard regardless of where

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,890
you use it some of the key binding stuff

00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:47,020
I do is in the operating system layer so

00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:48,700
in lotions post he talks about how to do

00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:51,070
this on a Mac and I think links on how

00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:55,600
to do it in Windows it you can do it in

00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:58,030
Linux with either X key caps or forget

00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,570
what the terminal input like term cap

00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,610
files you can do it with too so

00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:05,950
depending some of them are easier to do

00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:08,230
in one place versus another depending on

00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,910
what you're trying to do like the F key

00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,490
macro stuff for example that's in my

00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:15,460
Emacs config it's not in the the

00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:17,980
keyboard firmware but the on the

00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:21,670
keyboard io the space cadet bindings I

00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:23,230
have on the thumb marks to do shift

00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:25,510
versus parenthesis and those other

00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,970
things that's in the I was originally

00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:32,560
doing that in an operating system layer

00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:44,110
but I moved it into the firmware other

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:45,640
questions yes sir have I put nearly as

00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,410
much thought into Mouse position as I do

00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,900
keyboard layout no I actually try to use

00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:51,520
the mouse as little as possible because

00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,640
taking my key taking my hands off the

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,810
keyboard annoys me I also stopped using

00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:02,110
a mouse a decade ago for a long time I

00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:06,430
was using a Logitech thumb trackball and

00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:17,620
I use Apple trackpads now instead of

00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:19,330
mice yeah do I have any thoughts on

00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,250
plover which is apparently according

00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,480
stenography software I've actually not

00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,900
heard of it and I haven't looked into

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,390
cording keywords at all it is something

00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,040
I'm kind of interested in but that also

00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:32,490
feels like another like I'm already down

00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,490
this hole

00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,840
any advice on switching between your

00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,220
weirdo setup and normal setups that

00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,350
you're forced to use so I have this

00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,600
problem like I used to be a sysadmin and

00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:57,430
I would run into issues because you

00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,900
would have to go down to like the data

00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,220
center and type on a console that's

00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,820
physically plugged into something else

00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:05,800
and even just this was back before I got

00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,870
super weird I was just typing two or AK

00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,860
but how you'd have to switch to a QWERTY

00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:17,710
keyboard I don't have any great advice

00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:19,750
look at your fingers more I find I have

00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:21,760
less difficulty switching between the

00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:24,820
keyboard i/o and my laptop keyboard

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,160
because they're physically so different

00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:30,640
that it seems like the muscle memory is

00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:33,790
in different slots and so if I use the

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,370
keyboard i/o and then I can I can like

00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:39,370
alternate between them and and be

00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:44,650
equally fast on both because they are so

00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:46,900
sort of physically distinct so I don't

00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:48,790
know if I guess then the advice would be

00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,650
if you are in a position where you have

00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:52,300
to frequently switch between the two you

00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:55,390
should make your custom setup more

00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:58,630
physically distinct to try to allow you

00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:04,690
to distinguish it more readily Hobbs do

00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:10,810
you have a question did anybody else

00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:12,610
have any questions yes how many

00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:15,370
keyboards do I have in regular use so I

00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:19,180
have the keyboard i/o attached to a

00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:21,610
desktop machine I have a Mac laptop

00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,620
keyboard that I routinely use and I

00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:28,060
occasionally you I occasionally use this

00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:31,090
Mac keyboard or this Mac laptop Docs and

00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:33,070
it's plugged into an amp pro 2 at that

00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:36,490
point and then I actually have that code

00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:38,950
keyboard hooked up to a mostly headless

00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:42,680
Linux server that sits under my desk so

00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:52,070
for ish

00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:55,940
I can stop at any time there's a knock

00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:59,060
off plank there's a logitech just normal

00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,830
way out bluetooth keyboard there's an

00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:04,760
ogre docks kit that I never got around a

00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:06,680
building and then I don't know like who

00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:11,440
doesn't have seven or eight hundred four

00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:13,870
key plastic pieces of junk in the garage

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,560
anybody else have any questions

00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:17,560
all right go Hobbes

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:13,740
and this is a former coworker I have

00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:37,320
nothing to add further than that so

00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:40,470
thank you all for coming one of one of

00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,270
the things on my to-do list because I've

00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,640
done this a couple of times I usually

00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:47,420
bring a few keyboards with me I didn't

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,590
this time because my suitcase was full

00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,540
the keyboard I oh I have set up in

00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:53,070
firmware so that it's my own weird thing

00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,330
which makes it hard for people to kind

00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,950
of play around with it one of the things

00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,660
on my to-do list is to set up a binding

00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:01,680
because you can have multiple different

00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:03,090
key maps loaded in it I want to set up a

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,940
binding where if you hit both of the

00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:08,100
palm keys at the same time it'll go back

00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,480
to just the normal out-of-the-box QWERTY

00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,120
layout and if you hit him again it'll go

00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,260
back to my nonsense so yeah there's

00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,270
stuff like that that I've thought about

00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:18,120
the question was if I thought about ways

00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:19,470
to make my weird keyboard stuff less

00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:22,320
interfering for other people who might

00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:24,420
have to use my machines but most of the

00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,110
time like and I'd share my toothbrush

00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,110
before I'd share my

00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,630
[Music]

00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:44,380
have I started looking at different

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,859
profiles so profiles for those of you

00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:51,099
who are not down the rathole refer to

00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:53,650
like basically the the positional offset

00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:58,109
across the the keyboard and if you look

00:41:53,650 --> 00:42:03,099
at like this so these are pretty flat

00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:04,660
profiles kind of if you look at like

00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:06,940
this and pro 2 you can see that has a

00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:09,339
that's not a typical profile the way

00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:12,640
particularly the top row is pitched kind

00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:15,609
of forward no I really haven't

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:18,400
but it is definitely a thing like again

00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:21,400
the whole subcultural rathole around

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:25,299
this stuff goes really really really

00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:27,730
deep there's an an Pro to specific

00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:30,460
subreddit that's basically just people

00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:31,839
posting pictures like this and other

00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:41,130
people going how would you get those

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:43,329
keycaps man so you can actually come a

00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:46,839
commission there are places that you can

00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:48,609
send like designs to and they will yeah

00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:51,730
they'll do the injection stuff for you

00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:53,829
it's fairly expensive but the that

00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:56,109
keyboard enthusiast site that I

00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:58,450
mentioned where I got the the notion

00:42:56,109 --> 00:43:00,789
that the pitch for that 75 key or the

00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,230
linear keyboard I get an email from them

00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:03,999
once a day that's like here's the

00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:08,710
special for the day and frequently it's

00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:10,410
like a key cap they do they have an

00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:16,180
entire line of custom Dwarf Fortress

00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:17,859
related key caps like it's it's pretty

00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:23,680
crazy out there on the internet I don't

00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:26,009
know if you've noticed yeah and the bad

00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,009
chest

00:43:31,279 --> 00:43:34,650
have I seen the hall-effect bass

00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,539
keyboards these the one where it's like

00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:38,220
a magnetic induction thing yeah I've

00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:43,920
heard about him I haven't like touched

00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:46,380
one it's just a slightly different way

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,140
of actuated the key that doesn't it

00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:51,269
depends on two magnets moving next to

00:43:49,140 --> 00:44:03,839
each other as opposed to leaf springs

00:43:51,269 --> 00:44:05,220
making contact with each other many

00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:13,710
people have strong feelings about the

00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:16,499
touch bar stuff yeah have there been

00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:18,989
Dvorak type strategies for any languages

00:44:16,499 --> 00:44:22,249
other than English I don't honestly I

00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:26,239
don't know I haven't really gotten into

00:44:22,249 --> 00:44:29,640
key layouts that are used in non-english

00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:32,460
for non-english languages and even if

00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,229
you look across the what's that I was

00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:37,079
sort of the English by default world

00:44:34,229 --> 00:44:39,599
like the default layout in the UK is

00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:44,430
actually slightly different than QWERTY

00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:46,529
there's a layout called azerty basically

00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:50,339
because the a and the Z are where the Q

00:44:46,529 --> 00:44:52,859
and the W are and that's used in like I

00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:54,450
think France uses that by default and

00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:56,609
some of those layouts are actually

00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,930
extremely difficult for programmers to

00:44:56,609 --> 00:45:00,329
use because some of the punctuation

00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:05,219
symbols we think of as common aren't

00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:06,269
easily accessible I mean if you I had

00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:09,299
never thought about this before but

00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:10,829
actually but like Perl is extremely

00:45:09,299 --> 00:45:12,420
America centric right there's an

00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:15,960
assumption there's a dollar sign on the

00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:18,359
keyboard right somebody should make a

00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,329
send in a patch so that you can use like

00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:22,950
the pound sign for the same thing is it

00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:26,519
yeah or the euro instead of the dollar

00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:29,029
sign for the the scalars at all Perl six

00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:29,029
people get on

00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:35,710
alright anybody else I'm around the

00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:38,530
whole conference if you want to nerd out

00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:41,880
keyboards come grab me otherwise I'll

00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,880
