Description: 
	Folks in IT spend a tremendous amount of time every day working on their keyboards -- writing code, updating tickets, sending emails, building out project plans -- but most of us don't give any thought to how we use that keyboard. This talk will cover a number of keyboarding changes you can make that enable more effective keyboarding -- changes that will potentially reduce the negative consequences of over-use of traditional keyboards. We'll also explore the fantastic range of keyboard customizations that are available today with custom programmable keyboard firmwares.
