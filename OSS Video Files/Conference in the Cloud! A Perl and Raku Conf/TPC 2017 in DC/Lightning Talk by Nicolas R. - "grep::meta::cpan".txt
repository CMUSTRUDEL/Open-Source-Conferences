hi I'm going to talk today about great

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,620
Medici panel which is kid an

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,990
experimental project but first a quick

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,480
introduction about me I'm Nicolas I'm

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,020
working for sipping air on yes we are

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,480
hiring on WordPress on there

00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,910
so grab dot method HIPAA org it's not

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,449
the first time that you heard grab on

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,060
sippin together indeed there's our first

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,340
project which is still there and pretty

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,079
pretty great with the chip and let me

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:36,059
keep using it okay the idea that when we

00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:38,640
we were doing the investigation of the

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,340
dot ink removal it was not available and

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,950
we need our own solution so we've

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,840
thought about this on we asked around us

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,620
on one of the first alternative we had

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,020
was a lets you see pandigital yes it's

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,840
watch pretty well but it's relevant to

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,489
complex for what who are using so we we

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,489
fight about the quick and dirty solution

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,800
which has oh see when you have the zero

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:05,250
two fives at least all the table let's

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,439
download them extract them on yeah let's

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,880
use grab from the command line or ask if

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:14,520
you prefer on yes this is working so but

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,270
from there could we improve it yes we

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,880
can we we can simply create a git

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,430
repository okay so I'm using a gate

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,409
ideas for thought that we do this and

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,479
from there you can use get web live

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,270
would enjoy using get weapon on daily

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,979
basis and yes it is working on this even

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:37,710
going faster than the simple grab from

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:39,900
the command line that's cool now if I

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,619
can use get ripe oh that means that I

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,079
can free she was also

00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:48,329
parallax in the pattern that Evans

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,360
awesome that's not something I was able

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:55,409
to do with the previous website and I

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,829
like that idea so let's try to push this

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:02,729
together okay we have more than 1

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:06,990
million files about 20 gig of disk on

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:09,869
with a single commit on just a bare git

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,000
repo is about to gate to gig okay to the

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,680
dot gif and if you win it which is more

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,170
there but if you read the Gita

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,939
well I see say if you're get we posit or

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,900
is above one gig you might receive a

00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:23,969
notification okay let's see at the L so

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,379
from there the ID was okay we have a

00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:27,689
gives people what just going to push it

00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,090
to get above gate level whatever on

00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:33,030
we're going to use their UI as a

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:36,239
fronting because there's a search button

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:40,349
there unfortunately it doesn't work like

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,780
this it is not working and let's like to

00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:44,730
browse the source code same thing you

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,769
cannot run browser source code you can

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:51,000
you are pretty limited when you're width

00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:53,459
at that size you have set so let's get

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,560
our own fronting and from there we came

00:02:53,459 --> 00:03:02,819
with the idea of let's steal the run

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:04,769
method even you I look on Zillow own Don

00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:08,159
Surratt so this is a very very dominant

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:10,319
or app that we built on some ID came up

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,840
with or I want a case insensitive search

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,719
I want to be able to only look on the

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,709
p.m. 500 only on the SPSS 5 and so on

00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:23,159
and so on so we we build that how does

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:26,040
it works or you can use that website you

00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,810
can search pattern there on the thing is

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,000
there's a query running in the

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,250
background on the second that query

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,720
returned in or wizard we stopped

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,409
displaying that we're not going to way

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,689
that we parse the 17 gig of advice so it

00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:41,760
should be pretty fast if your request is

00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:44,009
pretty common and of course going wrong

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,470
girl the less communities but the idea

00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:50,030
that if you refresh that page like one

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:53,009
two to five seconds after from six

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,349
result there see you will go to

00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:58,229
something like this and you will notice

00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:00,959
that there is a limit we we are not

00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:04,169
going to parse after the 2000 or first

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:08,069
five we stop there for human point of

00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:10,979
view it's it's good enough but you can

00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:14,939
also filter by module if your module is

00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:17,729
not part of that to 2 mm first 5 then

00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,799
you can filter by the modules there by

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:23,550
using your own app and you can use

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,349
gloves also so alpha if it's work a

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,389
scenario is that nothing much your

00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,800
request and it's going to be

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:31,860
there is a timeout that will trigger

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,810
after 15 seconds I mean most common

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,280
research is going to be asked us at the

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,889
other if it's not pasture because

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,849
there's a cache or so behind this so all

00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:43,560
of this live online you could find the

00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,599
git repository divided into three parts

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,569
one for the front one one for the

00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:50,999
background which is updated or so on one

00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:53,759
for the tools there are some node works

00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:56,699
some geezer feel free to submit open

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,499
tickets or patch are welcome on all of

00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,830
this after enduring the true sense omit

00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:03,960
enjoyment in France in May on I would

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,479
like to thank every one every sponsor we

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,610
were part of that on yes you can start

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,470
using it

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,989
[Applause]

00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,989
