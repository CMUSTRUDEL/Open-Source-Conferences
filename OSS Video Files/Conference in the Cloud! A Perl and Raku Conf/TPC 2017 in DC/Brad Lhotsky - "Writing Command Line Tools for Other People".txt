Title: Brad Lhotsky - "Writing Command Line Tools for Other People"
Publication date: 2017-06-23
Playlist: TPC 2017 in DC
Description: 
	All of us have written command line scripts in Perl. This talk aims to share some insight into writing tools others can use. We'll venture down some best practices and take a peak at a few really useful modules on the CPAN and how to use them. We'll look at CLI::Helpers, a library I'm maintaining and make heavy use of on a daily basis for simplifying common tasks you and your users need.


Brad Lhotsky programs Perl and throws large amounts of data into PostgreSQL databases and ElasticSearch indexes in search of meaning. He often ponders why security is seen as a roadblock to development and operations while trying ever so hard to automate himself out of a job. Brad has over 15 years of experience in operations and development and is currently automating security and operations at Craigslist with Perl.
