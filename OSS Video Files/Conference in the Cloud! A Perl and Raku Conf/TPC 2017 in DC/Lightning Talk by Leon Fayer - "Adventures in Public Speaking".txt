otherwise so many people it's actually

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,030
it's fun right main thing to remember it

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,079

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,739
other people know better than that

00:00:41,730 --> 00:01:01,050
that's not a solution

00:00:43,739 --> 00:01:02,940

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,390
practice with political point cream

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,729
while I'm talking over the tool price

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,380
tonight okay pretty conservative

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,409
and if you think of parameters

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:18,840
everybody's gospel like think of the

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,590
bookkeeper here in Ohio that clearly do

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,720
something interesting

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,939
other people will find Tecna not happy

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,240
when a ship to you but it dishes doesn't

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,860
and really information that you like I

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,630
guarantee that during the ideologies but

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,970
Wilkins with of the room like Apple

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,640
turns in and say broke this stuff we're

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,229
going to war right which means

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,130
everybody's going to have an opinion and

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:43,110
their being is your story right so I mix

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,820
a right sided before addicting

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,880
everywhere like what's the worst thing

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,880
that

00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,910
oh yeah professional professional

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,510
secrecy has accepted that you wanted an

00:01:53,910 --> 00:02:00,840
analyst here with silver and and there's

00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:02,700
only thing you can do victim in itself

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,350
you can propose minute so you can do

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:10,560
like until you can do max recommended

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,330
the completion is circular do it the

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,180
normal difficulty actually decides it

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,200
does it doesn't matter great for games

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,600
itself differently

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:29,940
I know people who said their connections

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:31,500
or their holders of the pressures of

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,700
things like practice on Kelly's

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,730
requisition for workers trust Karen go

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,870
too long to get under these things

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,400
remember it sorry for great if you

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,860

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,610
talking to other people or deers or in a

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,640

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:12,660

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,600
effort into just organize here right now

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,870

one boring per slide give it one second

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:49,210
