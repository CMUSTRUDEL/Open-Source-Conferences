Title: Thomas Sibley - "Last mile software development: writing modern software for bench scientists"
Publication date: 2017-06-22
Playlist: TPC 2017 in DC
Description: 
	This talk will focus on the need for, process of, and impact of developing custom software and data systems for scientists. My aim is to give you a glimpse into the rewarding world of software in science by drawing from concrete examples in own my experience of building systems using Perl, Python, JavaScript, Elm, and many other languages. For over three years now I've been the staff programmer in a biology research lab at the University of Washington, and I'll share what I've learned along the way after making the jump from commercial software development.

Interested in learning more about software in science? This talk is for you!

Do startups excite you? A science research lab has more in common with a startup than you might think!

Enjoy learning new domain knowledge to get your job done? Biology is fascinating and amazing!


Iâ€™m a software developer in a University of Washington microbiology lab despite my Geology degree. I still like rocks though and not just in my Old Fashioned.

	00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,490
all right hello my name is Thomas Sibley

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,470
as Josh just told you I'm here today to

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,099
talk about modern software development

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,290
in a biology research lab I'm going to

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,969
use the term scientist in science fairly

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,920
loosely but just keep in mind that my

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,590
experiences in biology and you may find

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,820
your mileage may vary in physics or

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:26,430
chemistry or things like that so I work

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,800
in the Mullens molecular retrovirology

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:32,450
lab at the University of Washington in

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Seattle and that's kind of a mouthful

00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,770
yeah go Huskies

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,879
but molecular retrovirology means that

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,680
we look at viruses with RNA genomes and

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,489
the interaction of these viruses with

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,930
the molecules in human cells we approach

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,600
questions about the evolution of these

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,579
viruses and their interactions using a

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,850
variety of wet lab techniques at the lab

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,699
bench and dry lab bioinformatics

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,469
techniques at the computer

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,570
each informs the other and also an

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,040
exploration of questions ping-pongs back

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,530
and forth between the wet lab and the

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,920
dry lab and the wet lab again and so on

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,080
and so forth this is a diagram of HIV

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,700
which is the virus that the lab

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,950
primarily studies so my responsibilities

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,549
cover everything involving a computer in

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,560
the lab basically from analyzing data to

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,689
writing new applications to even

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,880
managing our racks of hardware down on

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,670
the second floor I've been in the lab

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,619
going on for four years now we're just

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,930
about four years and have helped

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,979
modernize existing applications and also

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,270
kick off brand new ones so you've

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,979
probably heard horror stories about the

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,560
kind of spaghetti right only code that

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,060
academic research produces or even worse

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,600
maybe you've looked at the bio pearl

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,979
source code that's a cheap shot but I'm

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,420
here to tell you that not all software

00:01:52,979 --> 00:02:00,360
in science has to be terrible and this

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,070
will be a talk in three acts in the

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,799
first act I'll explore this idea of the

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,780
last mile as I think it applies to

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,450
software and science or at least

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,950
software in biology in the second I'll

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,370
talk about the kind of work I do in the

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,840
lab and show examples of improvement

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,849
we've made to the computing practices

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,610
viewed through the lens of lessons that

00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:21,290
I've learned in the lab in the final act

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,530
I'll talk about why you too might want

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,940
to work in a science lab so let's get

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,040
started

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,040
the Mullens lab where work has been

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,810
around for 23 years at u-dub and 12

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,209
years before that as those Stanford and

00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,220
then Harvard that's a lot of time to

00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:39,500
generate data and some of the labs

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,209
ongoing projects spanned decades with

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,440
new data being collected from the very

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:46,790
start up until now this plot shows the

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,700
collection dates of samples that the lab

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:52,970
manages and worked with and you can see

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:58,519
that the x-axis starts back in 1985 and

00:02:52,970 --> 00:03:00,410
goes up to the present the success of

00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,849
those projects is directly related to

00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,890
the labs ability to make sense of the

00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,569
data over time and not lose it to the

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,940
frequent turnover of students and

00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:09,950
postdocs or misplace it amidst shelves

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,930
of lab notebooks like these lab

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:16,989
notebooks are an indispensable tool but

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,989
they don't scale we have walls of this

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,790
[Laughter]

00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:26,329
so helping the lab make sense of data

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:28,549
over the longer term and preserve it for

00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:29,959
future study is an in health informatics

00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,840
application that were started well

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,609
before I joined the lab called virus

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,560
this is a quick example of a detail page

00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:41,540
for a sample in the virus system and

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,030
it's great but bit rot is a real concern

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,500
and having the data doesn't matter if

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:49,130
the software for accessing it doesn't

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,859
work well or isn't maintained so when I

00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,109
first started virus didn't look like the

00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:54,410
previous picture it used cobbled

00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:57,410
together

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,480
Yui 2 components everywhere it was

00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,389
running on mod pearl it was using not

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:06,470
just a homemade ORM but also Class D VI

00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:08,720
and DB IX class all kind of together one

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,150
big happy family um it was version

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,730
controlled in this unholy combination of

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,880
centralized CVS and private unshared

00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,470
mercury over Depot's and changes would

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,150
come in and commits like this where

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:26,570
there are 14,000 insertions some

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,260
synchronization no explanation over

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,600
about a

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,430
before me various individuals had made

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,930
their mark on the application and after

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,490
a while you could pretty much tell who

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,590
wrote what by how the code looked and

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,180
how well it functioned most of the

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,650
people in my position before me had come

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,100
to the job with a background primarily

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,360
in biology and not software the

00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,130
development practices that have been

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,860
used for years behind current best

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,170
practices and coming from an open source

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,930
and commercial software background I saw

00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,120
many opportunities for modernization in

00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,970
ways that would help the lab get the

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,410
work done that they wanted to do it was

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,240
clear that many improvements in the

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,220
field from better development tools to

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,740
design practices to error handling to

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,400
user experience simply hadn't reached

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,870
the lab and I don't attribute this to a

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,790
lack of caring on the part of the folks

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,040
before me they care deeply about the

00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,900
work they were doing but I think for all

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,590
sorts of reasons ranging from the

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,610
obtuseness of modern front end snacks to

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,460
traditional funding structures in

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,230
biology that advances in software and

00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,650
computing just hadn't reached them yet

00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:32,390
they weren't aware of them and so this

00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,250
is idea in telecommunications that's

00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:37,070
been applied more generally to providing

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,140
any good or service this idea that

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,180
covering the last mile of distance ie

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,490
to someone's home is much harder than

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,350
providing coverage up to that point it's

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,550
this last mile that necessitates your

00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,770
distribution network whether it's

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:51,500
physical or virtual leased out immensely

00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,300
and seemingly immeasurably compared to

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,930
more concentrated service delivery

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:59,420
points mail services are a good example

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,310
and typically used every day the US

00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,310
Postal Service touches often literally

00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,350
every mailbox in America the USPS would

00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,430
be a much smaller business if it just

00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,320
had to get mailed to regional

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,990
distribution centers or even local post

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,000
offices the difficulty in expensive

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,040
bridging that last mile is the reason

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,840
why private mail carriers like UPS and

00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,130
FedEx as they handled more and more

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,830
packages with the rise of online

00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:25,040
shopping started using USPS for final

00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,830
delivery that's when your Amazon package

00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,560
takes longer than you want it to show up

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:32,480
so USPS already had a last mile Network

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,100
because it's a much older organization

00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,100
and it had the mandate to do so

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,250
so when I first started the lab I kind

00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:40,750
of thought the terrible software which

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,060
is par for the course because no one

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,840
cared as long as it appeared to work at

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:49,930
least once but the reality is that

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,370
people do care and so I see it as this

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,110
last mile problem it's not that the

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,060
field doesn't care about producing bad

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,130
error-prone code that reinvents

00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,870
previously solved wheels over and over

00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,610
again but that the field doesn't have

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,260
access to modern practices and

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,550
technology when it comes to software and

00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:09,490
more broadly computing so the tech

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,350
industry at large at least you know in

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,360
the public eye is busy building gleaming

00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,520
glistening towers up in the clouds and

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,600
so while it's busy innovating by putting

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,120
software and everything from

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,260
toothbrushes to mugs the industry

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,210
doesn't seem to have much interest in

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,080
actually trying to advance other fields

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,330
by bringing them the bread-and-butter

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,949
tech that we've all had for a while now

00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,949
and that we're used to things like

00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:34,810
snappy reactive web apps that you know

00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:36,070
consider user interaction so I don't see

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,900
many people who I think of those tech

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,610
ambassadors people who try to keep one

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,740
foot in technology and one foot in some

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:45,220
other field and facilitate the transfer

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,510
of that knowledge it seems that everyone

00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,910
thinks the text might just trickle down

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:50,500
eventually and an older name for

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,680
trickle-down theory was horsing Sparrow

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,060
Theory the tech industry is easy to

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,460
blame but it's not all at fault of

00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,200
course traditional funding structures as

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,729
I mentioned before can make it hard to

00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,979
competitively hire professional

00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:05,919
developers and generational and

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:08,470
institutional biases often devalue staff

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,990
roles in science making it harder to

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,639
justify bringing in outside Talent so

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,550
neither of these are universal but they

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,770
are impediments that are slowing but

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:21,910
they are impediments to progress that

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:23,560
are slowly over time breaking down so

00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:27,160
while I can't effect funding structures

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,570
at the NIH I can help dispense with the

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,860
myths that all software and science has

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,310
to be terrible and other people writing

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:36,120
it has to be trained scientists perhaps

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,120
I can even pique your interest

00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,580
from day one my goal is to improve the

00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,250
situation I found I didn't know much

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,750
about biology at the time but I knew

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,880
what rotten software smelled like and

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,620
the name of the game was to throw what

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,380
was run and to keep what was sound and

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,640
then to build from there since they

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,920
didn't have a big picture of what the

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,900
lab needed at that point I hope that by

00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,580
just relentlessly trying to improve the

00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,560
computing environment that I found I

00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:04,310
would find ways to help everyone out

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,400
through that progress was slow at first

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:09,680
and I spent about my first three weeks

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,810
converting a mess of a global CVS

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,839
repository to the best gift repository I

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:17,270
could manage that was as much for my own

00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:22,370
sanity as the ability to actually make

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:23,540
meaningful progress in a sane way more

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,600
weeks were spent improving the

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,850
deployment infrastructure for virus the

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,170
labs primary web application so that I

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,940
could deploy changes during working

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,230
hours without accidentally eating

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,140
someone's data that they were in the

00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,520
middle of inputting gradually tangible

00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,310
improvements compounded and real

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,600
progress was easier to make and about a

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,430
year later the results were good enough

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,200
that I could convince my boss Jim to let

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:47,690
me hire a co-worker to work alongside me

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,190
and since then improvements been much

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,110
more rampant and together we've been

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,839
able to feasibly tackle larger projects

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:57,500
and I think that's an inch I think

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,750
that's a critical point is that there's

00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,040
a lot of people working in computing and

00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,200
science who are working by themselves

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,250
and who are become isolated because of

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,050
that because they're surrounded by

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,410
people who don't do the type of things

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:13,370
that they do in the lab and so I do

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:15,980
think that part of this part of what's

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,010
important in getting software developers

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:21,709
into science is to get them in pairs or

00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:26,450
in threes or fours or in organized cores

00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:28,459
that can help multiple labs at once so

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,709
what did what did we learn in the lab so

00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:32,600
over these past years I've learned a lot

00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:34,850
about how a lab works and how science

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,310
works and I wanted to share those

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:39,800
lessons and examples with you these are

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,930
lessons that I remind myself of and try

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,490
to work by because often my default

00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,500
reaction is the opposite of what I've

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,960
learned

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,150
I think they give a nice glimpse into my

00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:52,250
day-to-day role and I strive to make

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,570
excellent software for scientists and so

00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:58,550
these are these are the lessons that I

00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:00,590
try to take the heart the first is that

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:03,470
you should try to enable people to use

00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:06,140
better practices and what I mean by this

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,430
is that we should we should make it

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,260
easier for people to follow best

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,970
practices with whatever work they're

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:14,420
doing rather than to try and force them

00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:16,120
to do so a while back we had an issue in

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:21,440
the lab around how sequences were named

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:23,210
sequences are are the the DNA the

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,400
genetic code that is passed on

00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:29,080
generation to generation and this

00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,220
happens in viruses as well as in humans

00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,140
scientists would generate these

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,180
sequences in the wet lab and attach a

00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,760
mostly standardized name and then upload

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,170
them into our database by reverse but

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,670
when it came time to do the analysis

00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,520
instead of downloading the sequences

00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,110
kind of in bulk out from virus they

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,580
would collect all the data from dozens

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:49,490
of personal folders that were strewn

00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:52,220
across our shared lab file server now

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:53,900
this was an ideal because virus was

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,820
supposed to be the authority of the

00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,670
sequencing data and it was important to

00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,589
keep the assigned ID numbers that virus

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:04,430
gave to each sequence so that we had

00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:07,430
data provenance tracking sequences were

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:09,770
also sometimes revised in virus without

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:12,290
the data files that were originally

00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,970
imported being updated themselves and so

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,650
people ended up using out-of-date data

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,540
data that has been you know q seed

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:23,089
already and they were using the yun QC

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:25,250
data the problem was is that it was hard

00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:27,020
to find and download all the information

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,600
you needed and when you did each

00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,400
sequence was assigned a name that as far

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,230
as anyone was concerned was just noise

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,700
to them that got in the way of analysis

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,110
something I had to deal with first

00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,960
before they could get started doing what

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:42,260
they really wanted to do and names look

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,660
like this gibberish this is an insane

00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:48,100
mix of both fixed-length fields with

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:52,910
variable length fields in the middle

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:54,500
it's impossible to parse correctly since

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,500
the sequences on the file server were

00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,370
more sanely named because a human had

00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,529
been involved people naturally op

00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,720
to use those instead so instead of

00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:05,940
trying to enforce this policy and you

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,350
know kind of beat people in the line we

00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,240
made it easier to get sequences from

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:17,580
fire worship and easier than trolling

00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:20,250
the file server to find them so first we

00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,230
improve searching to find the batch of

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,589
sequences you needed this was the

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:27,750
previous advanced search it's typical I

00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:29,339
build things like this you may have

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,710
built things like this I think they're

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,490
bad they're hard to understand it

00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,630
requires a bunch of clicking and you

00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:40,560
kind of have to know what to punch in to

00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:42,330
get the results you want beforehand so

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,220
what we replaced it with was this

00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,050
faceted search interface which updates

00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,670
immediately when you click a facet value

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:50,550
one of these values in the list there on

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:53,430
the top and it's immediately graspable

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,930
just by playing around you don't have to

00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,700
already know what kind of values you can

00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,260
search for you can get a sense of the

00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,029
distribution of values that are in the

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:04,709
system just by looking at the list of

00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:05,940
facets because they're all just shown so

00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:07,170
faceted searching is one of those

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,089
improvements that's kind of all over the

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,310
tech world you see it on almost any

00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:12,690
e-commerce site you see it in lots of

00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:16,290
searching things like elastic search

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:19,310
support it but I rarely see faceted

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,300
searches outside of outside of tech

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,520
we're also using a slimmed down version

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,220
of the same component to replace some

00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,990
data tables since it kind of works

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:33,480
nicely as a general filter interface for

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:34,709
any table that's long so crucially now

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,140
that people had a way to find the

00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:38,550
sequences they wanted the download

00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,190
process also started letting you choose

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,930
how you wanted the sequence is named

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:46,020
this widget is pretty simple and it's I

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:48,150
mean as a as a programmer it's not

00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,430
really that interesting necessarily on

00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:52,709
the face of it but it's intuitive and

00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,910
it's super useful to the scientists so

00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:55,260
you check out the fields you want in

00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,900
your sequence names and you can drag

00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,700
those fields around in that list and

00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,410
that's the order that the sequence names

00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,640
come out it's as simple as that it's

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,560
kind of you ask what you want for and

00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,850
you get it you can change the delimiter

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,320
if you want things like that and off you

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,550
go the data has been tailored to your

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,370
needs and so that's a crucial part is

00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,249
that

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:18,939
when you can provide tailored data with

00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:21,610
a little bit of import input more people

00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:23,079
will start wanting to use that data so

00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,939
people started searching their sequences

00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:27,459
from our application from the authority

00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:29,470
of this data they kept the unsigned

00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,939
ideas intact which meant we could track

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,040
the provenance of those sequences

00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:34,329
through an analysis to say well what's

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,420
the reaction that originally generated

00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:39,550
this and they didn't have to spend any

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,259
time renaming sequences themselves with

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,899
this careful series of find and replace

00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:45,939
operations and text triangular or some

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:51,910
not so careful series of find and

00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:54,189
replace operations so another lesson

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:57,910
we've learned is to don't collect data

00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:59,589
that you don't plan to use it's tempting

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,059
it's very tempting if you're working

00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:02,319
with a database and collecting data from

00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:04,449
people just to collect as much as

00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:07,329
possible in the hope that it'll be

00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:09,189
useful someday but all this does in the

00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:11,740
short term is I work for everyone you

00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:14,139
have to support it and they have to

00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,569
enter it and bench scientists already

00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,100
keep detailed lab notebooks that shelves

00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:19,600
of things you saw before so it's not as

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,370
if the data is gone forever if you

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,889
actually need it later in a science lab

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,059
it might be work to get it but you can

00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:26,800
do it

00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:28,509
and it also turns out that if you ask

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,639
scientists to enter information that

00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:32,679
they know is never used and they're

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,559
smart they'll figure this out they won't

00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:36,819
bother to enter it accurately anyway you

00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:38,050
might as well just stop collecting it

00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:38,949
it's going to be easier for everyone

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,040
because you're not going to be able to

00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:44,069
use the shoddy data so we ran into this

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,209
with our sequence upload workflow

00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:49,089
previously people were required to

00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:50,559
tediously paint this diagram of how they

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:53,259
were submitting their samples to the

00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,300
sequencing facility and this interface

00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:57,490
required repetitively dragging over the

00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,139
diagram to specify up the dozens of

00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,290
different values for each sample

00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:03,339
sequence and it was all color coded

00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:06,899
there's kind of this mimetic interface

00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:09,370
that looked like a sequencing plate and

00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:10,990
after doing this they then still had to

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,600
manually prepare the exact same

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:18,010
information in a different format to

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,299
give to the sequencing facility and then

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,549
when they eventually got the results

00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:23,559
back they had to upload these several

00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:25,149
dozen files they got and manually drag

00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,750
and drop them around to match up with

00:17:25,149 --> 00:17:27,250
the correct look

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,530
and these diagrams that they had

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,570
painstakingly made before I really wish

00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,400
I tried very hard to find an image of

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:36,220
this so I could show you instead of just

00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,050
describing it to you but it was one of

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:41,010
the very first things we gutted and

00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:46,270
removed and I simply couldn't find it

00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:48,580
good riddance really so after they had

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:53,170
mashed up their data with this diagram

00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:55,000
they had drawn it was kind of slow and

00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,410
error-prone and and ultimately

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,510
collecting data we didn't need we didn't

00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,770
care about how exactly it was submitted

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,060
to the sequencing facility we cared

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,560
about the steps in the lab up to that

00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,050
point and then we cared about the

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,880
results and we never use this data in

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,980
between that they spent you know

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,460
sometimes hours meticulously going

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:14,860
through and also there's this other

00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,570
point which is that because people

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,130
realize we didn't use this they some of

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,780
them started fabricating these diagrams

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,850
in ways that made the data input steps

00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,180
easier rather in ways that actually

00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:27,820
reflected the reality of the situation

00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,590
and so even though we might have had

00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,180
some good data in there that you know if

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,650
we had had a use for it we could have

00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:37,330
used we wouldn't have been able to

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:38,950
separate it so in the end we replaced it

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,530
with this kind of simple input workflow

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:45,220
it has a batch a batch upload process

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:47,440
and that offload process can just get a

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,330
drag-and-drop a bunch of stuff and then

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,250
it incorporates heuristics for automatic

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:54,340
data matching so instead of requiring

00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:56,770
people to match up everything themselves

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,540
you kind of do the best job best effort

00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,570
you can and then ask them to review what

00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:04,060
the computer did and so now all they

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:06,190
need to do is review these matches and

00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:10,360
if they see any mistakes they can fix it

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:11,680
and then save the results and people

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,150
were so appreciative of this change

00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,190
because we stopped wasting their time

00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,000
and that's part of this if you're not

00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,400
going to use the data

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,980
don't don't collect it you're just

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:28,150
wasting everyone's time and I think this

00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:30,400
also highlights something that is very

00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:33,340
common in a science lab where you're

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,750
working with things that people do which

00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,850
is that the computer should be this tool

00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,380
that helps them and so if it can get

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,400
most of the way or part of the way

00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,260
you're kind of doing

00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,510
half-decent job that's better than doing

00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:51,100
no job at all if they can review those

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:52,960
results and fix it so data once you have

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,450
it is also useless unless it's in front

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,340
of someone's eyeballs when I first

00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:00,070
started a lot of the data we had wasn't

00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:02,740
very visible to the lab I had access to

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:05,200
it if I knew it existed which wasn't

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,790
always the case being new and I could

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,890
pull it up on demand from the database

00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,809
but the lab didn't always know what data

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,760
we had or have the ability to see it so

00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,920
they didn't know to ask for it

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,750
invisible data doesn't inspire questions

00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,309
it doesn't generate hypotheses it

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,460
doesn't register as available or

00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:22,840
pertinent when planning analyses

00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,640
probably about a third of my overall job

00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,440
is thinking critically about how to best

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,309
surface and present the data that we

00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,530
already have and there's a lot of work

00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:34,120
to be done there scientists are

00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,190
naturally curious and so if there's data

00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,390
in front of them they'll look at it and

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,250
the last questions of it and they'll

00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,929
want to know more and there are all

00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:44,050
sorts of good ways to get this data in

00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:45,940
front of people many people dismiss data

00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,500
tables as kind of boring and immediately

00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,160
reach for plots and charts and diagrams

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,660
may be animated and kind of whiz-bang

00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,670
but I would take a thoughtful well

00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,670
designed data table over a poorly

00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,710
thought-out visualization almost any day

00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:01,630
and there are all kinds of data tables

00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,860
you're really not limited they have

00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:06,160
nicely two different needs and

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:08,200
constraints so you can start simple with

00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,520
this kind of static but information

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:14,080
dense table for basic scanning

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,660
sparklines are helpful for increasing

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,580
information density in this table

00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,590
showing longitudinal data that wouldn't

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,390
otherwise fit but it is important when

00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,850
skimming this table to find suitable

00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:28,720
subjects for study that we have in our

00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:30,550
sample repository from there you can add

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,440
things like filtering and sorting by

00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,880
printing properties and the table

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,980
becomes a little more interactive you

00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,170
can do things like add graphical labels

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,150
for easier scanning there's another

00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,720
example of not a spark line but a spark

00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,720
chart there

00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,120
and as the data becomes more complex you

00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:51,630
can present different views of the data

00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,340
with the same toggle so these buttons at

00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,840
the top convert the units in the table

00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,549
because depending on what you're doing

00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,130
as a scientist with this information

00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:01,500
different using units are easier for

00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:03,000
some tasks than the others now this is

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,980
really simple you can copy and paste the

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,570
data and throw into Excel and make a new

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,220
column with a formula and do it

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:10,220
that's extra work who wants to do that

00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,820
so

00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,760
tables like this you can also you know

00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,650
filter by arbitrary expressions and it

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,870
doesn't have to be limited to say just a

00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,510
simple text filter imagine the slack

00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:30,299
text search box where you have operators

00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:32,240
you can be fine-grained you can be vague

00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:36,000
and you can try and just do your best

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,890
and sometimes it's nice to interactively

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,750
link a table with the visualization so

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,910
that people can flip between the two as

00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,830
they dig into the data the previous

00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,840
table you just saw and this plot of data

00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,669
are linked and so that's selecting a

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,220
curve and the plot you just click on it

00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:52,410
select the related data in the table and

00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,720
vice versa and you can toggle what's

00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:59,640
shown and what's not shown and get a

00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,830
sense of what's going on and when a data

00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,100
table becomes unwieldy like this kind of

00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:07,770
all scrolling all dancing horror it's a

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,860
little laggy here you can upgrade it

00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:14,340
directly into a visualization and regain

00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:16,320
comprehension so this is what replace is

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,720
replacing that table and it's not only

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,070
increasing information density that is

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,520
it's fitting more information into the

00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:30,620
same space but also clarity and there's

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:33,440
no more horizontal scrolling so

00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:36,590
simple plots are kind of a dime a dozen

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,720
in science but good visualizations

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,730
really integrate and synthesize lots of

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,940
data in order to highlight relationships

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:47,840
within and between groups and this is

00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,070
looks like a relatively simple chart but

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,110
what it does is compares the performance

00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,730
of this current experiment over

00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,890
thousands of data points for each

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,210
experiment and then highlights that

00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,340
current experiment and shows you how it

00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,799
relates to other experiments that are

00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,620
related to it so in this case it's by

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,779
the same subject and so we use this for

00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,909
quality control and at a glance instead

00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:09,350
of staring at reams of data I'm trying

00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:11,360
to get a sense of what's the gist of

00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,520
this thing what's the overall sense of

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,899
of how we're doing you can look at

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,669
something like this bad visualizations

00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:21,140
on the other hand they're they're hard

00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:23,990
to digest and they leave you wondering

00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,250
who thought this was a good idea they're

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,640
kind of like a pizza with too many

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,440
toppings it's better just to split it up

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,870
and to have each thing separately if you

00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,340
want a pizza with that's half a Y and a

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:44,600
half an two of Ian mustard will get it

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:47,960
half and half not altogether so another

00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,360
lesson we've learned is is this one and

00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,580
it says designing and building research

00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,640
software is different than building a

00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,289
product to your vision research software

00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,990
must fit into the workflows that already

00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:01,940
exist and by and large those workflows

00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,529
are outside of the computer and you

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,470
can't dictate what those workflows will

00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:08,659
be necessarily your modeling real-world

00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:11,120
steps that happen in experiments things

00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:13,850
that experiments produce and actions

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,350
that people perform you don't typically

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,590
get to decide what someone does at the

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:20,149
lab bench and so challenges are

00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,980
different from designing many software

00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:23,120
products or applications well you can

00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,159
kind of figure out well how's this

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,919
feature going to work exactly how do we

00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:29,899
want people to interact with this the

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,669
software in a research lab is in service

00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:34,250
to the science and the scientific goals

00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:38,299
and a job is to save labor not created

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:40,620
by imposing new demands on people my

00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:42,990
colleague Evan

00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,759
talks about this goal as building right

00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,399
up to the edges of what researchers are

00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:49,529
already doing and sometimes I like to

00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:52,110
think of this as I won't touch what

00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:54,620
already works for you you know we're

00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:58,399
going to get as close as possible and

00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:02,509
kind of take a carve away from tedium

00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:05,009
but you can still doing do you

00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:07,320
so one of my concrete lessons with this

00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:11,370
was when building a data input widget

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,639
for counts of cells this widget mimics

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:16,889
the layout of a particular device used

00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:19,519
under a microscope to count alive in

00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:23,669
dead cells it's called a hemocytometer

00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:26,700
each quadrant these kind of couplets of

00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:28,320
boxes gets counted along with a volume

00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,669
and no dilution and then the number of

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,220
cells and the entire dish can be

00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:34,470
extrapolated from that and I talked with

00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,210
the scientists a lot about the process

00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,649
of counting cells and the steps and data

00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,070
involved because I wasn't familiar with

00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:40,619
it

00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,840
there were mock-ups and sketches and a

00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:45,809
design the widget with this data entry

00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,700
task in mind it supports a tally mode

00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:50,159
designed for use with an external numpad

00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,720
where he presses either tally live or

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,659
dead cells and you can move between the

00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,490
quadrants and back and forth you can

00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:59,190
fully operate it with a single hand and

00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:01,590
it even includes distinct audio feedback

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,759
for the keys you've pressed so that you

00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,129
know when you've hit the right one when

00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:06,480
you're not looking at it so they could

00:27:05,129 --> 00:27:08,009
directly enter this data while they were

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,909
collecting it and I was pretty pleased

00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:14,340
with this result after all that thought

00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:18,179
an effort though it was barely used as

00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:19,499
intended so what went wrong well see the

00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,690
scientists are recording these counts

00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:23,580
while in a biosafety level 3 lab space

00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,559
they're in bounds they're in hats

00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,289
goggles they're wearing two gloves on

00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:32,039
each hand and it's hot in this small

00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:33,899
fully enclosed room counting cells is

00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:35,580
mundane and it's tedious and it's a lot

00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:37,679
of time staring down the microscope and

00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,629
so they streamline the process with two

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,049
people one prepares the cells to count

00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:44,490
and the other just counts furiously

00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:46,409
plussing with a laptop and software to

00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,149
do direct entry even with the ux

00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:50,190
affording affordances that i thought

00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:52,470
were useful it was just a non-starter

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,040
the goal is to get in and get out of

00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,170
this space as quickly as

00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,580
possible and so it's much faster to use

00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,770
a physical clicker just like you see at

00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:01,420
a movie theater and scribble down

00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:03,640
numbers on any old piece of paper and

00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,960
then transcribe that to a spreadsheet

00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,760
when you get back to the comfort of your

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,140
office so what do we do well we remove

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,100
nearly all of that specialized

00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:16,090
functionality that I was proud of and we

00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,890
just left the bare-bones

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:20,860
input widget in case you needed to enter

00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:23,500
something ad hoc and the way we do it

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,780
all now is you download this template

00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,600
excel file you fill in your data you

00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,920
upload the file back and boom it's in

00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,920
the database

00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,530
it's simpler it was easy it took less

00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,630
time to build them the other thing and

00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:39,250
this met the scientists on their own

00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:42,550
terms kind of right up to the edge of

00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,960
what they were already doing another

00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,450
good example of this is when we realized

00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,610
our scientists were hand labeling dozens

00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:51,250
of tiny stickers for every experiment

00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:53,470
they did each stickers label had to be

00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:56,340
different and so even using a word

00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:59,170
template was kind of laborious for this

00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:01,540
any in this photo each white dot there

00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,920
is a sticker on top of a very small vial

00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,170
and that's not a giant marker the

00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,550
stickers are just very tiny and these

00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,810
aren't normal printable stickers you'd

00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,820
buy it Office Depot either

00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:12,130
these are cryo safe stickers so they'll

00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:15,310
stay stuck to vials for years at minus

00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:17,920
200 degrees C while they chill out in

00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:19,510
the liquid nitrogen freezer so our

00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,000
science is just buckled down to get the

00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:24,810
job done every time and it was obvious

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,190
that we couldn't let that stand

00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:29,020
so after only a couple days of hacking

00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:31,840
testing discussing stickers getting law

00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:33,910
tech to work our scientists can now come

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,010
to the labs tissue culture ask tea cosy

00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,660
and generate labels based on the

00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:40,060
relevant data for the experiment that's

00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,620
already in our databases they were

00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,300
looking it up there to begin with and

00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,570
then kind of printing it out and then

00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:48,400
going down and writing on stickers and

00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,230
so now they just come in and tell us

00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,910
tell the app what experiment they're

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,890
wrapping up and freezing down to put

00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:57,250
into the freezer for for safekeeping for

00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,600
later use and it generates PDFs of

00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,490
stickers and they print those out and

00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,070
they just go to town sticking them on

00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:04,420
vials and so once they no longer had to

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,040
worry about actually labeling the

00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,059
stickers themselves they started

00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,139
suggesting improvement

00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:09,940
that would help them find these in the

00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:12,039
freezer later like color coding the

00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,840
label text and creating a second sticker

00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:15,460
for each vial which contained additional

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,110
information and these are things that

00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,580
were just unthinkable before because it

00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:22,419
just would have immensely increase the

00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:24,820
amount of time but once they were salado

00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:27,999
stickers are easy to make these new

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,529
ideas can delight there's also this

00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:30,850
piece of paper in the background of this

00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:33,519
picture and I think it's an interesting

00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:36,129
piece of paper it's kind of this table

00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,899
you can't really read the text on it but

00:30:36,129 --> 00:30:39,700
that's a plate set-up guide and so our

00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:42,429
application produces this as well you

00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:46,240
get a you know when you when you set up

00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:48,009
an experiment in the application what

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,840
you get back from it is a bunch of

00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:51,220
instrument setup files that go load on

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,139
the scientific instruments that are

00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,669
going to run the experiment so that

00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:56,499
doesn't have to guess manually input and

00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:57,759
you also get this PDF of setup guides

00:30:56,499 --> 00:30:59,980
and that tells you how to put your

00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:03,330
samples on these plates that then get

00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,649
put into the instrument to get run

00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,600
taking a couple hours of our time to

00:31:05,649 --> 00:31:09,639
produce those automatically is saving

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,740
the scientists many many hours of time

00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:13,570
in the long term because they used to

00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,730
look at the data tables figure out where

00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,200
stuff should go right down there make

00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,029
their own chart like this either in

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,619
Excel or just by hand and then take that

00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:25,139
to the lab bench space and follow it and

00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:27,940
so this is another example of saying

00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:34,600
this is what you're already doing let us

00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:36,159
do part of that for you so this is this

00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,340
next lesson is learning to be

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,720
comfortable adapting your models and it

00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,759
kind of tags along with meeting people

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,830
where they are so research science moves

00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:46,139
rapidly much more rapidly than most

00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,129
software development can keep pace with

00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:50,769
especially when the scientists are

00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:52,419
likely to outnumber the developers and

00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:54,220
scientists will perform an experiment

00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:56,169
learn something from it and then rinse

00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,090
and repeat ad infinitum over and over

00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:59,980
again week after week tweaking not just

00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,470
variables but also abandoning and

00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:04,840
adopting entirely different methods you

00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,759
can't model every experiment you can't

00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,350
capture all of that data you can't

00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:10,990
predict how the data being produced will

00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:14,220
fundamentally change over time as the

00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:16,210
way it's being generated changes

00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,400
scientists are constantly looking at how

00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,690
they can improve

00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,490
the steps that they're doing and the

00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:23,580
data that generating and so it's

00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:24,900
drifting software for bench scientists

00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,090
is so close to the physical world that

00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,910
no simplified abstracted model that we

00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:32,430
like to work with none of those models

00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:35,100
survive the real world very long before

00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:36,390
needing to be revised so because of this

00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,580
I kind of learn to become comfortable

00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:40,290
making changes to our schemas to be

00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:43,170
comfortable changing our object models

00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:45,540
to always consider if the problem will

00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:48,450
be easier by first adapting the model to

00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,490
fit the new reality also for make

00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,960
simplifications about the real world in

00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:54,270
order to make it tractable and

00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,220
understandable and learning how to start

00:32:54,270 --> 00:33:00,059
simple and grow more nuanced from there

00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,410
as the needs arise is crucial we found

00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,880
some good tools and techniques to help

00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,700
cope with rapid schema changes and I

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,410
just want to highlight a couple of those

00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,030
so the first is indispensable we use

00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:11,400
David wheeler sketch to manage schema

00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:13,050
changes for our projects if you haven't

00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,850
heard about it go check it out it

00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:17,760
organizes your schema in two sets of

00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:19,500
deploy a river and verify scripts with

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,929
nice dependencies between your change

00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,429
sets declared in a plan file there's

00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:25,050
some nice command-line tooling and

00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:27,090
things that leads a really useful dist

00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:30,150
and get it's pretty good and I recommend

00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:31,770
it it's certainly better than putting

00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:34,710
your database migration scripts in your

00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:36,210
commit messages who's going to remember

00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:40,380
to run that before deploying to

00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:42,030
production so what sketch is nice for

00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,620
bringing sanity to the process of making

00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,330
schema changes sometimes you need two

00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,970
flexibilities to start capturing data

00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:49,650
before you can make those changes before

00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,960
you've made sense of what those changes

00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:53,280
need to be other times you want to

00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,020
capture data that's just inherently

00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,440
variable and annoyingly hard to model

00:33:55,020 --> 00:34:00,090
relationally and so a JSON document

00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,260
store is a great option for this but we

00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,210
didn't really want another database

00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:06,450
service we run everything on PG it's

00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:08,370
awesome we love it and we did actually

00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:12,240
want the documents themselves tied to

00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:15,000
other relational objects so we use the

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,919
JSON document storm Postgres we found it

00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,690
works really well and the results give

00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:20,250
us this nice combination of flexibility

00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,530
without throwing out all of our

00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:24,600
relational integrity or adapting a kind

00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:28,139
of fully D structured object key value

00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,340
relationship table it's easier to start

00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,490
using and provide straightforward

00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,649
upgrade paths

00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:34,240
to proper relational tables once you're

00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:35,649
far enough along to know what's worth

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,320
we're factoring into this relational

00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:40,210
model and what's not it's also fast the

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,700
native Jason types in Postgres are

00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,320
indexable and work well you can even add

00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,480
check constraints to do basic jason

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,690
document validation and the documents

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,760
are manipulable at manipulatable and

00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:54,750
traversable in sequel when you need it

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,340
which makes ad hoc queries very easy

00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:59,440
this also lets you create views designed

00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,560
for analysis that present the documents

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,820
as flat tables joined into relevant rows

00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,130
meaning our data scientists don't have

00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:11,800
to know the document structure or Janson

00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:13,240
operators in sequel they can just use

00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,270
this as a normal table whether that's

00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,810
from R or Python or we have bringing it

00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,330
into Excel

00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:23,560
whatever it is Excel can talk to your

00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:25,270
sequel databases and our DB IX class

00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,100
models have helper methods for search

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,830
for searching and filtering on these

00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:32,050
jason documents the document columns

00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:34,210
themselves are automatically inflated to

00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,859
these typed document classes so that we

00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,060
constrain them on the application side

00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:40,030
and work with them as first-class

00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:42,250
objects this approach also yields nice

00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,540
options for future schema upgrades when

00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,040
you realize that perhaps some of the

00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,930
JSON data should be properly modeled

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,850
since the data is already in the

00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:53,470
database it's straightforward to write a

00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:56,470
migration script in schizophrenia and

00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:58,900
into proper tables so we use these

00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:00,850
documents in two ways one is just as a

00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,190
column directly on a primary record

00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:08,109
usually to hold variable metadata and

00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:10,930
and the second way is as this better

00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:13,210
object key value pattern kind of an

00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:15,460
object document pattern if you will and

00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:16,780
this document table refers to objects by

00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,340
real foreign key using K now the

00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,140
metadata and relationships is necessary

00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,220
now there are different lis quibbles you

00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,710
can have with this coming from a

00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:26,020
relational model but it works and it

00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,700
works well and and there's there's room

00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:31,150
to grow when it starts to not work as

00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,290
well I'm one tantalizing improvement to

00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:34,450
this approach that we may try in the

00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:37,180
future is using our application document

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,140
models to produce JSON schemas and JSON

00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,970
schemas to produce

00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,070
database check constraints so that we

00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:43,350
can validate documents regardless of how

00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,270
they answered the database

00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:49,980
even if they come in directly from an

00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:51,300
insert so finally I think the most

00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,890
exciting and important lesson I've

00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,660
learned during my time in the lab is

00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,640
that when you remove the tedium from

00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,350
people's work you help make space for

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,750
them to think up new ideas and

00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:02,490
improvements to their workflows

00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:05,190
what's deemed reasonable or even

00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:07,740
desirable to do changes once these

00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:09,210
tedious tasks vanish and people can

00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,620
think more creatively about the bigger

00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,510
picture

00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,190
many of us have likely encountered

00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,140
fundamental misunderstandings about

00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:19,410
what's easy to make the computer do and

00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,480
what's very very hard every visible

00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:23,580
successful example of automating away

00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,380
tedium is another example of how the

00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:27,510
computer can work for someone and a

00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,820
closing of that gap of misunderstanding

00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:32,730
they can better relate the possibilities

00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:34,290
to their own tasks and so at first in

00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,760
the lab I kind of had to ask around for

00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:38,640
direct ways that I could help people

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,170
with their work but over time as people

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,570
saw the successes we were making I

00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,950
started approaching us to ask about some

00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:48,600
process they were doing and making it

00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:51,120
faster or easier or less error-prone so

00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,400
is this for you well the field of

00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,500
biology has a dire need for people who

00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,020
can think computationally and write good

00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,370
software at all levels the field is

00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,430
currently grappling with how to build

00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:03,930
out these skills that last mile

00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:05,700
currently demand vastly outstripped

00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:08,340
supply for computational skills in

00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,680
biology there's a general consensus that

00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:13,110
the field needs to as a whole

00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,940
incorporate more bioinformatics and

00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,740
software development training into

00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,260
undergraduate and graduate biology

00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,600
curriculums and while there certainly

00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,310
must happen to a degree it's a little

00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,290
like saying well to be a successful

00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:28,350
mechanical engineer you also need a law

00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:30,030
degree the disciplines and practices of

00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,310
bioinformatics and software development

00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:35,100
are vast and the practices of biology

00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:37,620
are vast and while familiarity and

00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,840
literacy in both you know bioinformatics

00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:42,180
and self-development is a good goal it's

00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,190
unreasonable to expect biology students

00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:47,190
to start mastering multiple fields in

00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:48,570
the same amount of time and so there's

00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,680
another strategy that I think should be

00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,480
part of the solution and that other

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,580
people do as well and it's starting to

00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,079
come around in the field this idea of

00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,400
creating staff positions for and

00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,999
including professional software

00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,319
developers into research science there

00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:03,880
are interesting and meaningful problems

00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:05,469
to solve in biology and it's a very

00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,239
different culture than a tech industry

00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:10,420
both of which can be attractive selling

00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:11,890
points to the right people so rewards

00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,509
are working in our lab remedy you'll

00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,400
learn a new domain and learning new

00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:17,559
domains is always fun there's things to

00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,969
know that you didn't know before

00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:20,979
scientists are happy to teach and

00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:22,269
explain you'll be doing scientific

00:39:20,979 --> 00:39:23,319
research where the problems are

00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:24,819
different than you're used to and

00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,769
there's broad space for your own

00:39:24,819 --> 00:39:28,599
thoughts your own decision making your

00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:31,930
own implementations and getting feedback

00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:34,180
on all of those in real time and the

00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:35,739
pace is often fast and exciting

00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,329
you can never keep up with these bench

00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:38,859
scientists whether they're working on a

00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:41,469
new ass they are just churning through a

00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:43,479
rote set of experiments thinking on your

00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:45,190
feet is necessary so you'll build

00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:47,769
minimum viable products to start

00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:49,029
capturing data now and then later figure

00:39:47,769 --> 00:39:52,930
out how to refine it for ongoing

00:39:49,029 --> 00:39:54,849
analysis and as programmers who know

00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,469
Perl you're well pleased to think in

00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:58,630
terms of both high-level applications

00:39:56,469 --> 00:40:00,249
and raw data manipulation you'll be able

00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:04,779
to deploy regular expressions to save

00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:06,609
the day multiple times and most

00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:09,190
importantly you don't need a PhD to do

00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:10,869
this work but you do need to have

00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,579
empathy and a determination to help

00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:14,650
others and I like to think of this as

00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:18,940
compassionate computing our software for

00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:20,410
humans that's all I'd like to thank Evan

00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,670
Silverman my coworker for his thoughts

00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,440
and conversations about these topics

00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:26,140
while we work and Jim Mullins

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,849
for his support and in allowing me wide

00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:30,069
discretion in the lab with what I work

00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:33,150
on and thank you for your attention and

00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:36,260
I'll take any questions

00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,260
[Applause]

00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:48,619
I just wanted to make a point reportedly

00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:54,600
this was not how tax software elephant

00:40:48,619 --> 00:41:09,150
and everything except actually looks

00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:11,570
like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and

00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:13,800
and that's something you know I realize

00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:15,720
as I was learning these things that

00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,600
they're applicable more broadly than

00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,130
just science but the way I the way I

00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:27,990
learned not all of them but some of them

00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:30,109
was through these interactions yeah over

00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,109
there

00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:44,150
yeah that's a I could mean I could do a

00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:46,759
whole nother talk and maybe I should

00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:48,619
sometime on sound biology because I

00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:51,949
think the biology behind this stuff is

00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:53,089
fascinating but there's there's a lot to

00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:56,499
talk about them there's a lot of

00:41:53,089 --> 00:42:01,939
backgrounds to to bring up to speed on

00:41:56,499 --> 00:42:06,319
so some of the more recent work the lab

00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:10,519
has been doing is so retro viruses like

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:12,859
HIV they when they enter a human cell

00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:15,349
they end up integrating themselves into

00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:18,769
your cellular genome so into that cells

00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:21,289
DNA and then they get expressed and kind

00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:26,989
of replicate through that after that

00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:28,939
process and so you might ask well how do

00:42:26,989 --> 00:42:30,859
they like where where do they integrate

00:42:28,939 --> 00:42:32,119
into your genome your genome is huge

00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:34,609
it's humongous

00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:35,569
compared to these tiny viruses so where

00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:38,599
do they integrate do they have

00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:40,969
preferential locations and hotspots are

00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:42,319
there patterns in the genes that they

00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:44,509
integrate into are there patterns and

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,539
where they integrate relative to other

00:42:44,509 --> 00:42:50,539
genomic features and things like that

00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:53,749
and so some of the the work we're doing

00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:56,449
currently is to look at that data and

00:42:53,749 --> 00:42:58,309
it's not data I talked about here but

00:42:56,449 --> 00:43:00,799
we've built software and databases and

00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:02,900
applications for that as well

00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:05,359
it's a look at those those sites of

00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:07,489
integration those integration sites and

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,979
see what are the relevant factors and so

00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:12,169
there's some papers over the last couple

00:43:09,979 --> 00:43:14,630
years some of our preliminary work for

00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:17,359
this in science and there's another one

00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:19,459
coming out soon I think in cell I'm not

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,029
sure if it's not sure what the status of

00:43:19,459 --> 00:43:27,489
that is so don't quote me on it

00:43:22,029 --> 00:43:30,529
but we're finding that the the I

00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:31,759
shouldn't say that because I can't

00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:34,189
explain the background of it in this

00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:39,529
amount of time so it would be properly

00:43:34,189 --> 00:43:43,729
understood but there are integration

00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:46,039
sites with HIV are linked to other genes

00:43:43,729 --> 00:43:49,759
that are related to other diseases and

00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:51,499
things like that yeah come talk to me in

00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:51,690
the hallway and and maybe I can talk to

00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:55,099
your

00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:55,099
up a little more yeah

00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:14,579
yeah I feel like they're pretty

00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:16,739
forgiving and they're very willing to if

00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:18,029
it's necessary and or something's

00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:19,559
necessary even if it's going to be

00:44:18,029 --> 00:44:21,359
tedious and boring and hours of their

00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:23,279
time or all day of their time you'll

00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,769
just do it because it's what has to get

00:44:23,279 --> 00:44:28,649
done and that's kind of the work ethic

00:44:25,769 --> 00:44:30,359
that is in research science so when they

00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:31,829
get frustrated is is more when we've

00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:33,509
talked about something and I'm like oh

00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:35,729
yeah we can totally build that for you

00:44:33,509 --> 00:44:36,719
we'll do that it'll be great here's

00:44:35,729 --> 00:44:39,209
here's the plan

00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,259
and then life conspires and we have a

00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:41,759
million other things to do and that

00:44:40,259 --> 00:44:45,089
doesn't happen for a month or two months

00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:47,189
or three months for six months and then

00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:48,839
they come back and like so could we do

00:44:47,189 --> 00:44:50,789
this thing and they're asking the same

00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:54,059
questions and I'm like yeah oh we talked

00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:55,139
about that I'm sorry and so I feel like

00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:58,199
that's that's when they get frustrated

00:44:55,139 --> 00:45:01,019
and in terms of talk to them about kind

00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:03,269
of spec'ing out the work one of the most

00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:04,919
useful things if it is directly related

00:45:03,269 --> 00:45:06,839
to what they're doing at the bench is to

00:45:04,919 --> 00:45:08,819
go into the lab and watch them do it and

00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:10,049
ask questions as they do it and year so

00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:12,119
they'll just show up behind their

00:45:10,049 --> 00:45:15,449
shoulder to say hey can I take Dylan can

00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:16,859
i watch you do this a couple times you

00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:19,469
know when's a good time for you when I'm

00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:20,759
not going to distract you and can I just

00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:22,709
watch you do it and pester you with

00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:24,539
questions about what's going on and all

00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:26,369
the assumptions that you're you know

00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:27,659
you're making that I know or that you

00:45:26,369 --> 00:45:29,519
think I know but I don't actually know

00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:31,649
or I want to more fully understand so I

00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,809
can model it so it's probably the most

00:45:31,649 --> 00:45:35,429
valuable technique is sitting down and

00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:37,919
sketching at a whiteboard and talking it

00:45:35,429 --> 00:45:39,989
and then seeing it seeing it or really

00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:41,669
seeing it first and then once I

00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:43,319
processed it getting them back in a room

00:45:41,669 --> 00:45:45,449
and and sketching out saying here's what

00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:51,389
I'm thinking am I missing anything is

00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:52,840
what's wrong here all right thank you

00:45:51,389 --> 00:45:59,079
very much

00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:59,079
