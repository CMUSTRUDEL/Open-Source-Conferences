Title: Jason McIntosh - "BumpySkies: A Passion-Project Postmortem"
Publication date: 2017-06-23
Playlist: TPC 2017 in DC
Description: 
	Jason McIntosh spent much of 2016 creating BumpySkies (bumpyskies.com), a turbulence-forecasting tool for nervous air passengers (such as himself). In this talk, Jason explains why he spent a year writing a web application instead of writing a book, why making one dang webpage took a whole year (government agencies are involved), and the hopes and uncertainties that lie in the project's future (government agencies are involved).

Maybe he should have written a book after all. Well, whatever, he did this anyway, and he's going to talk about it. Come hear him talk about the rewards of asking people for stuff nicely, and the pitfalls of writing software that's only useful for doing a thing that you're normally too scared to do very much.

Look, he's already written two books and that's all behind him now, okay?

Freelance software engineer, game design consultant, and creator of various online organizations and oddities. Daily Perl user since 1998.

thank you very much I spent a lot of

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,719
last year making this thing it's a

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,610
website called bumpy skies it does a

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,139
fraction of what I'd like it to do

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,719
someday but today it can provide

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,000
graphical predictions of turbulence for

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,670
near future flights over the continental

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,710
US I made it for nervous wires like me I

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,140
think of it as a tool for demystifying

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,760
flight by mitigating surprise turbulence

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,410
prediction represents only a start of

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,090
what I'd like to do but it does it well

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,309
enough that I consider it a shipped

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,600
project so when this project postmortem

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:35,579
I'll tell you about three things that

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,920
went well and three things that did not

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,480
go so well and an ill-defined number of

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,739
things that have yet to earn qualitative

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,739
judgments because they have not happened

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,480
yet for a project about managing fear

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,010
bumpy skies development depended upon by

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,370
overcoming personal faults

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,440
let's about fear and more about

00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,660
misperception I learned that tools and

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,640
resources exist outside of purely

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,750
independent study if one is going to ask

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,820
for the night to leave

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,649
I found myself able to personally

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,439
succeed in tasks that I previously

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,060
assumed I had no business attempting but

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,619
first I want to tell you about how

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,810
before I could do anything else I had to

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,390
throw away and we build my own sense of

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,320
professional identity see a couple years

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,540
ago I thought I was going to write a

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,460
book I'd done it before or anyway as a

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,850
co-author or at least a contributor a

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,100
long time ago I have few good memories

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,560
of these experiences and these are all

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,900
projects I agreed to when I was had far

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,630
more youthful enthusiasm and wisdom or

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,369
even basic preparedness but I thought

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,680
this time would be different I'd be

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,570
writing by myself about a subject deeply

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,979
interesting to me and sharing things

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,110
I've learned with people who really

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,329
needed it as opposed to just documenting

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,670
some computering stuff I had the exact

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,049
same thought five years ago and seven

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,729
years ago in fact the thought occurred

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,040
to me literally every time I got off of

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,750
an airplane because my thought was I

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,670
could sell a book to my fellow nervous

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,070
Flyers about all the knowledge and

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,570
techniques I had gradually accrued to

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,119
make the experience of commercial flight

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,710
left in your racket I was never going to

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,090
write that book and I know today I may

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,369
never write another book about anything

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,439
ever but I didn't know that when I wrote

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,330
a blog post in Salt Lake City during

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,090
that year's pearl conference two years

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,560
ago I was in a very writerly mood that

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,959
year I gave a talk about a blogging

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,940
Platform I had made and with my lizard

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,440
brain freshly hoarse from screaming all

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,630
through the across continental flight

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,640
things seem to align such that I

00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,220
couldn't not see my post as the nut

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,590
graph of a much larger work I was right

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,090
but not in the way that I thought my

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,260
flights to and from Salt Lake City were

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,200
the first I'd ever made on an aircraft

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,489
within cabin Wi-Fi not knowing what else

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,170
to do with it I spent the whole time

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:40,019
posting infinitely on Twitter as a

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,790
distraction while my jet pinballed over

00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:43,560
Heartland turbulence and my friends

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,140
encouraged me and brands engaged with me

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,170
and that was all great and I had a novel

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,840
experience of reading Noah's turbulence

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,519
maps even as the Jedi Road tour straight

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,530
through its various bright orange doom

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,630
blobs and while I still hated every

00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,549
minute of it I could feel my Terror

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,280
lessened by seeing it reduced from an

00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:04,230
unknown or tearing at my fragile craft

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,840
to a finite phenomenon whose discrete

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,400
borders fit on my tiny phone screen by

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,080
the time of my next long-haul flights

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,299
someone's later I discovered plane

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,489
tracking mobile apps like flight radar

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:17,099
which yes do work splendidly while

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:19,049
airborne and this led to be true pivot

00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,720
in my thinking about how I could best

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:23,250
help my fellow AVO probes and it was a

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,519
literal pivot which is to say it was

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,590
this lectern over Atlanta which flight

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,410
radar somehow plotted ahead of my planes

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,569
current position I paused in my mid-air

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,850
tweet shivering to ask out how out loud

00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:37,560
how this is possible and my friend Mark

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,510
said it might have something to do with

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,250
this crowd-sourced plane tracking

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,280
project at another service called flight

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,769
aware front and so my plane continued on

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,859
to Logan but before it landed I knew I

00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,540
had just started a new journey I gave a

00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,609
lightning talk my first phone conference

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,859
talking 2013 called just making things

00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,750
just make your thing where I set up a

00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:59,579
case that in software purposeful tools

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,109
however rough around the edges can bring

00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:02,819
at least as much value to the world than

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,160
the most beautifully architectured

00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,900
abstraction layers and as my plane

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,670
juddered through the clouds over

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,290
Massachusetts a I saw my long

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,109
assumptions of just repackaging

00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,049
monologist text and now I love text as

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:17,700
the less vital abstraction here my time

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:20,220
would be much better spent building a

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,440
tool one that would somehow mix these

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,500
disparate mobile technology magics into

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,780
some credit software that would directly

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,510
demystify flight

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,820
a fearful years overdue and thousands of

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:34,310
feet high the discarded pages of my

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,130
outdated identity as an author fluttered

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,020
into the bay I landed in Boston a fully

00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,720
self-conscious tool maker and I knew

00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,610
what my next tool had to be even as i

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,889
deplaned back into my home city I found

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,230
myself in gloriously unknown territory

00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:51,650
and of course I had to spend some time

00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:54,020
going about it all wrong one of the

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,430
dangers of working freelance as I have

00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,050
done for the last decade is the

00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,669
temptation to start viewing yourself the

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,070
way your clients intended you as a

00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:03,320
wizard ensconced in your high tower with

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,540
only your grimoire and your Palantir

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,940
working in beautiful isolation to bend

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,380
reality to match your will the danger

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,050
lurks and how this view can feel quite

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,640
accurate 90% of the time but healing

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,530
yourself off like this all the time can

00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,480
block even the most experienced actor

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,130
from utilizing some of their best work

00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,800
which requires not just showing up at

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,330
conferences and such but truly venturing

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,919
outside of one's comfort zone taking the

00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,169
initiative to reach out and ask for

00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:28,790
knowledge access or perspectives that

00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:31,280
will never come through a mere search

00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,990
query but when I began working on bumpy

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,700
skies I wasn't a big believer in any of

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,680
that so I retreated into my workshop

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,090
assuming that I could apply all my usual

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,650
methods it's isolated study and

00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,720
experimentation until the day I shipped

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,850
just as I was due I would do with any

00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,229
client driven task

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,550
obviously I would need access to cue

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:49,039
data sources one for weather conditions

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,660
and one for flight routes my idea being

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,310
that forgiving flight I would just run

00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,860
the ladder through the former and show

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,050
you the numbers somehow and my natural

00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,960
introverted starting point was let's

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,030
find the public API surely there are

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,919
public api's so I started with the

00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,720
flight plans and to my surprise I didn't

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,060
find any obvious API is offered by the

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,850
FAA even though I had a notion that

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,710
flight plans Republic information I did

00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,600
quickly find a commercial API offered by

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,729
a company called flight aware which

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,340
offered exactly the information I wanted

00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:23,030
for the low low price of 2/10 of a cent

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:26,150
for query ok well so noted let's put

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:28,910
that aside for now Noah they have public

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,890
API s1 even involves air turbulence it's

00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,780
a lot of fun you can give it a path of

00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,240
geographical fixes in a timestamp and

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,030
it'll send

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,520
no telling you all about air vents along

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,800
the way air Mets look like this they're

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,840
big ol irregular polyhedral floating in

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,060
the air with floors and ceilings defined

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,380
at certain altitudes they define a 3d

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,150
space that contain an increased

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,130
likelihood of atmospheric conditions for

00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,889
aircraft passing through them including

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,630
turbulence as perfect and I drafted a

00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,400
prototype out of it and some friends

00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,990
tested it but it was clearly too broad

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,449
to be a useful predictor of anything

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,069
from a passenger's perspective what I

00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:04,590
wanted was something like this no a

00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:06,289
graphical turbulence display which I've

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,090
used as part of my own creep up

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:12,270
pre-flight medication for many years and

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:14,099
friends I sunk many serious hours into

00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,409
the puzzle of downloading and analyzing

00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,669
these images pixel by pixel before I

00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:19,770
even began to consider the possibility

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:23,460
of doing something with those contact

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:27,050
links down at the bottom now my wife is

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,460
a public servant that's her on the left

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:32,039
she worked as a librarian for the US

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,229
Navy and upon hearing my image analysis

00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,389
was she said you know that contact forum

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:38,759
is probably monitored by somebody who

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,009
cares deeply about their work seldom

00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,900
hears honest curiosity about it and who

00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:44,130
would be absolutely delighted to hear

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,680
from a member of the taxpaying public

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,969
for who may ostensibly labor that struck

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,530
me as counterintuitive given my own

00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:51,479
typical private sector response to

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:54,240
unsolicited requests on my attention

00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:55,979
from strangers but I like to think I

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,139
know when to defer to experts and so I

00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,849
filled out that contact form feeling

00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,650
optimistic about the airman api's I

00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:03,330
asked if they made their graphical

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,840
turbulence data available in some plain

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,580
text format XML maybe JSON and I got a

00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,449
response almost immediately and they

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,370
said JSON or XML files yeah we don't

00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:16,169
have any data like that but we do have

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,460
an anonymous FTP directory full of

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:19,169
up-to-the-minute weather data using a

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,150
format that meteorologists use calls

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:22,919
grib and here's all the information you

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:27,509
need to get at it with that be useful

00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:29,069
and I said I will let you know and so I

00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:30,449
retreated to my tower which that

00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:31,860
particular afternoon was actually the

00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:33,510
blue state coffee house in Allston

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,250
Massachusetts and there I could work I

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,630
have no doubt anyone entered in this

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,089
room could have done and I had a great

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,159
deal of fun cuz they're already just a

00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:43,680
suite of open-source tools specifically

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,760
for working with grid data yet was it

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,120
already packaged up for Mac OS home

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,560
yes did it feel indescribable refreshing

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,810
to work with open source tools and

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,000
process data for a purpose more focus

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,470
than data processing own sake as so

00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,649
often feels like the purpose of my

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:01,180
career god yes and my discovery of this

00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:03,100
territory would have been impossible had

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,930
I not jump the track and contacted

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,300
someone from outside of my usual sphere

00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:10,120
and so I ended up that afternoon with

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,730
this and I fell jubilant and I posted it

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,320
to Twitter Jitterbug being an early

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,850
codename for the project and my friend

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,839
Jenny said is it a tumor and I was like

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,670
no Jenny but yeah okay I didn't really

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,970
provide any context so that's fair but

00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,589
no it's it's CONUS it's the continental

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,720
United States or rather a slice of the

00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:30,310
atmosphere above it or a forecast of

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,410
clearer turbulence intensities at a

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:35,560
particular altitude at a particular

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,029
minute on January 16th 2016 I was able

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,130
to read the data well enough to create

00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:40,660
this image and this is a moment where I

00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:44,170
knew this project had potential which

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:47,199
left the problem of the airplane I had

00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:50,230
enough that given takeoff and landing

00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:51,490
time and a line of navigational fixes I

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,230
could estimate what conditions

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,750
surrounded the plane at any given point

00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,220
on a concern II but asking users to look

00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,810
up and type in nav codes of their

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,139
upcoming flight versus just a flight

00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:03,760
number with a non-starter as an aside I

00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,500
learned a lot about aeronautical

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,569
navigation points for this project and

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,760
how there's no good public database of

00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:11,709
them all but you can fake it well enough

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,440
by downloading the free trial of

00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:18,279
explains flight simulator and rating its

00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,350
data text file but that is a tale for

00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,940
another time back to my tower which I

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,620
wasn't ready to leave again just yet I

00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,899
returned to my old friends at

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:29,620
FlightAware they of the commercial API

00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:32,050
and well I built a screen scraper of

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,720
their web app which among other things

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,459
turns flight numbers into nav pad this

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,110
would not scale to production but it did

00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,850
let me complete my proof of concept

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,589
which me and some friends of which means

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,029
in French were the only users and yes

00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:44,889
that's plotted against an apple map

00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:47,370
screen grab it was there and was good

00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:50,110
enough but now progress slowed down

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,930
never have I self so close to another

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,390
sole rights randall munroe in xkcd 979

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,670
and yet so helplessly alone as when I

00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,240
Google an error and there's one results

00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,980
thread by someone with the same

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,860
problem and no answer last close to two

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,600
in 2003 naturally it was not the only

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,339
jerk on the internet who wanted FAA data

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,649
and indeed found many instances of

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:11,450
people asking but no clear answers I did

00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:13,190
find some tantalizing almost rumor level

00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,570
pointers in multiple years old forum

00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,910
posts that all linked to the same URL

00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:19,310
and clearly there used to be a website

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,839
there but now it just held a 2011 press

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,580
release describing a random policy

00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:24,800
change like a fading concert flyer

00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,110
tacked to an old warehouse however it

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,850
had an acronym I hadn't seen before a FB

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,399
I and a reference to something called

00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,690
the FAA a FBI data feed escapes me

00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,190
another candle the search on and I found

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,709
for example this document will sync

00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,810
users of a FBI whatever it was which

00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:40,070
included my friends at sleight aware

00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,899
okay right track

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,399
I'd also seen mentioning of this class 1

00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:45,440
versus class 2 designation which would

00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,850
come in handy later finally I found this

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,399
PDF sitting in a directory containing

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,930
new index files and on an FAA website

00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,149
otherwise dedicated to flight delays

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,680
that search engines had indexed it to

00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:56,060
spoke at dignified past for that

00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,740
document and I could only assume its

00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,050
continued to existence an organizational

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,700
oversight I did not let that stop me I

00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,320
had learned my lesson from earlier I

00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,209
wrote the email address printed on it

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,130
like a tourist speaking from a phrase

00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:09,320
book I pieced together vocabulary I had

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,120
encountered but not fully understood and

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,040
I said hello I would like to request

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,029
information about obtaining class to

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,870
direct access to the FAA FBI data stream

00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:24,140
weeks later I got a response and it said

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:30,320
SDI we retired that have you checked

00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:32,060
data FAA you know the website we have

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,130
that is literally covered in giant green

00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,870
button the very first one of which is

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,170
labeled enroute flight and related data

00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:41,810
and I said how have you configured your

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:44,600
robots.txt no you know what never mind

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:46,879
thank you and friends I hit that button

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,009
and at this point about three months it

00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,749
passed since that Bank port over Atlanta

00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:53,120
and now I found myself set up with my

00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:54,680
own assigned contact at the FAA as well

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,209
as a passel of documents about hooking

00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,279
into the administration's flight data

00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:00,050
firehose and here for the first time in

00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,910
this project I faced an obstacle I could

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,160
neither codes nor question my way around

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,110
the FAA requires our organization

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,939
seeking this data first establish a

00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,439
permanent site to site VPN connection

00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:11,809
between some machine under their control

00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:14,180
and the FAA s own internal network

00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:16,759
now I barely know how the internet works

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,309
and I don't know anything about VPNs

00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:21,019
in my experience heretofore VPN very

00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:22,579
vague me annoying Colonel that business

00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:24,170
clients insist I leap over before I

00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:26,749
could SSH in and see why their apache

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,279
crash this time site to site VPN

00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:29,569
connections are swiftly learned or

00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:31,279
something much more intimate than this

00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:33,170
remote client sort of relationship

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,059
establishing an encrypted tunnel between

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,730
two routers that to each other as peers

00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:39,829
and are typically used to secure a

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,569
single organization geographically

00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:43,730
disparate sub networks over the insecure

00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:45,350
internet so as a prerequisite for

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,209
something I saw is a public API a

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,160
site-to-site VPN striping is a little

00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:50,449
weird a colleague of mine upon hearing

00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,100
about it compares the requirement to

00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:53,120
inviting a dinner guests over on the

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,209
condition that they come in through your

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,649
bedroom window it's just not a commonly

00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:59,870
encountered phenomenon at least not in

00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:01,639
the open-source key world and when I use

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,879
my shiny new superpower of asking for

00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,069
help

00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:05,839
I got nothing none of my colleagues you

00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:07,040
know how to implement it and I continue

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,569
to get dirty little results when I

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,250
decided to start spending some money on

00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:12,259
the problem hiring other consultants to

00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,790
help while I did have some great

00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:15,740
insightful conversations the problem

00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,660
still stumped every professional in my

00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,089
vicinity who I approached and was

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,500
willing to consider the problem and I

00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:23,329
talked a couple years ago about blogging

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,069
I mentioned it inside a how in recent

00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,990
years I've taken up regular exercise I

00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:28,879
had a two-fold reason for it on the one

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,589
hand due to both age and I see genetics

00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,269
I've stopped receiving daily well-being

00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,980
for free every morning but more the

00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:35,569
point new scientific and technological

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,250
developments like the standardized

00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:38,870
seven-minute workout and the panic way

00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,879
of web and mobile apps that implemented

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,529
made high-intensity workouts much more

00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,720
feasible for an otherwise lazy and

00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:45,949
antisocial person my whole life up until

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,170
then I assumed that I couldn't do

00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:50,389
push-ups that I don't know I lack some

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,250
ineffable sinew for it like how some of

00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,750
my friends can't eat cilantro but as

00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,310
soon as I reached a sweet spot

00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,560
intersection of personal motivate

00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,510
technological affordance I found that I

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,580
could do push-ups just fine decades of

00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,830
denial to the contrary and even though

00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,140
it took it up until the summer of 2015

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,790
for the penny to drop I do believe that

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,800
the experience helped me to question how

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,710
accurate was I just couldn't do network

00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,029
engineering what if crazy thought what

00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,010
if I took just a little that money I

00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:17,450
tried to spend on consulting as good as

00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,820
ideas that sounded at the time and

00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,830
blocked out some weeks and taught myself

00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,020
how to do this I'll tell you right now I

00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:26,000
still have barely any idea what a VPN is

00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,890
but I can also tell you I didn't let

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,630
that stop me I in all their

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,910
documentation the FAA assumed that you

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:34,310
the outsider would use dedicated I Cisco

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:37,250
branded hardware as your end of the site

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,660
to site VPN tunnel fine so be it after

00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,070
some time banging around in Amazon I

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,270
bought Cisco's cheapest networked

00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,130
appliance that literally had

00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,980
site-to-site VPN written on the box and

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,420
I bought a Raspberry Pi to use as a

00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,490
development server to which I had

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,680
physical access and I bought a static IP

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,660
address for my little office and using

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,339
the boxes Java GUI wizard which causes

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,190
my laptop's span to switch into jet

00:15:55,339 --> 00:16:00,080
turbine modes I got after two weeks that

00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,880
Raspberry Pi to talk to the FAA and

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,589
after two more weeks I managed to

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,290
translate the state of that Cisco box

00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:07,790
into a nice clean strongswan

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,980
configuration file running on one of my

00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,630
beautiful violence invisible liners

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:20,510
which is all I really wanted eight

00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:22,580
months prior both the PI and the router

00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:24,950
sit unplugged in places of honor on my

00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,060
office shelf today and that all brings

00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,550
it around to where the whole project

00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,100
rests today so what didn't go well

00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,839
obviously it took too long a one-page

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,880
web application that draws lines over a

00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:36,980
map of a single country shouldn't have

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,720
taken most of a year to build and while

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,000
I could further dig into reasons why I

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,890
find far more interesting the problem

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,080
that I can't eat my own dog food here

00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:47,330
that inspiration struck while I sat

00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,370
literally in flight makes for a subtly

00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,720
crucial point when I was blind to during

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,640
those initial months of subsequent and

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,140
entirely ground-based work when I was

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,270
able to pretend that my goals firmly

00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,880
established the rest was a simple matter

00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,470
of programming my joy at rapidly

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,450
learning and experimenting and iterating

00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,740
was genuine but in the excitement

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:06,079
I never thought through the fact that

00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,940
I'd be able to use the final project

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,550
only four or six times

00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:13,190
year at most I just don't fly that much

00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:15,890
today as much as I love seeing the site

00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,850
work I do so at a far more abstract

00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,130
level than I should

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:20,930
compared to stoop lured my blogging

00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,090
platform and my most successful self

00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,830
started open source project colleagues

00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,960
now uses several times per month across

00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:29,300
multiple contexts and this more than any

00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,740
github star count or whatnot has driven

00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,630
me to make it the best tool that I can

00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,370
there's no getting around the fact that

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,140
passion projects work best when their

00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,690
builder can also become their most

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,850
fanatical user and in bumpy skies of

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,550
case that just isn't possible and that

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,750
will always be a diminishing factor

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:46,310
thirdly and most worryingly the

00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,800
project's dependencies have become more

00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,330
precarious to no action of my own I have

00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,370
concerns now about its future viability

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,950
which didn't seem worth my trouble in

00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:57,560
late 2015 in particular those two data

00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:59,570
sources that rely on depend in turn on

00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,280
American tax dollars share through

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,050
transparent government funded science

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,810
that increasingly feels itself subject

00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,430
to a new kind of turbulence 18 months

00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,470
ago I wondered if using an anonymous FTP

00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:12,140
server outside of my control would give

00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:13,790
me problems later on today I wonder if

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,130
assuming the continued existence of

00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:19,910
publicly funded meteorological science

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:21,520
is folly I hope not but so far I don't

00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,320
have any reason to bail out in

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,850
retrospect I find bumpy skies absolutely

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,010
worth the effort I put into it so far

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,540
and with climate change all about

00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,490
guaranteeing that air travel will become

00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,960
only more turbulent I see this tool

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,770
itself as a source of comfort in an

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,990
uncertain future and yet I'm not sure

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,000
what to do with lumpy skies yet I'd like

00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:43,070
to add more features like mapping cloud

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,550
cover for fliers like these to see the

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,800
ground

00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:48,440
honestly I'd also like it to generate

00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,650
income somehow and that's truly flying

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,510
far afield of my own expertise so I end

00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,980
with an appeal if you or someone you

00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,750
know might like to speak with me about

00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,050
where this technology could go next and

00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:02,420
for whom please do look me up I'm

00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:03,670
willing to travel if I have to thank you

00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:10,989
very much

00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:10,989
