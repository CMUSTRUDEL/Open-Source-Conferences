Title: Jason McIntosh - "BumpySkies: A Passion-Project Postmortem"
Publication date: 2017-06-23
Playlist: TPC 2017 in DC
Description: 
	Jason McIntosh spent much of 2016 creating BumpySkies (bumpyskies.com), a turbulence-forecasting tool for nervous air passengers (such as himself). In this talk, Jason explains why he spent a year writing a web application instead of writing a book, why making one dang webpage took a whole year (government agencies are involved), and the hopes and uncertainties that lie in the project's future (government agencies are involved).

Maybe he should have written a book after all. Well, whatever, he did this anyway, and he's going to talk about it. Come hear him talk about the rewards of asking people for stuff nicely, and the pitfalls of writing software that's only useful for doing a thing that you're normally too scared to do very much.

Look, he's already written two books and that's all behind him now, okay?
