as I say and now for something

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,609
completely different we're going to talk

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,120
about kite photography with the

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:13,259
Raspberry Pi the Raspberry Pi is a teeny

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:18,240
tiny computer that I have on here with

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:21,119
the caboodle sensors on confidence and

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,460
I'll include some I'll talk to the pro

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,460
code that's very teeny tiny but it's

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:30,869
sort of a fun hobby and I've been doing

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:33,149
so we're in DC and I'm like I saw the

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:37,140
UAV trend coming and I was like I want

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,090
to do that FAA said no you can't so

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,270
instead I've been sort of trying to find

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,879
a way of doing something like that it's

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,890
a challenging fun little hobby this was

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,629
me as a kid and that's me a couple years

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,879
ago and you take a back basically a

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,160
package of sensors so you have the

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,309
computer on the lower left camera on the

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,350
upper right and a little power supply

00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:03,629
connect it together you put it up on the

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,369
kite which is the middle photo and then

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:10,260
by a cron job you essentially take

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:13,350
photos of the ground all information is

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,340
available by the way online at kites

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,110
likely that info and that actually has a

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,950
pointer to the github page and all that

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:27,960
fun stuff so yeah I was thinking

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:30,869
applying a drone inside DC if I want to

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,520
keep my job I can't really fly a drone

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:33,479
within the red zone which is actually

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,509
where we are right now

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,970
we would have to essentially drive south

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,710
for about 45 minutes to an hour

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:45,750
depending on traffic to actually fly a

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:49,020
drone so that's a little hard to do on

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:52,049
the weekend however one of the things

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,409
that that they a does allow is tights so

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,369
that's how I started this whole thing

00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:59,240
and actually they're actually

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:05,820
encouraging you to bring kites with them

00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:08,390
within the DC area so basically this

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,039
sounds like a job for a tiny computer

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:17,640
we're a 3/8 with

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:21,150
I is a plus is a small $25 computer

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:26,000
running Linux we take a little camera

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:28,019
power pack add some stuff to the kite

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,849
all the stuff that you would think of

00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:35,670
and you start taking photos so you can

00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:37,319
actually see on the left here how five

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,819
years ago I started with basically a

00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:43,349
piece of cardboard drilled some things

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:46,650
into the hole and magically everything

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:49,200
worked I lost that one in the ocean so

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:54,019
on the second version you see I added

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,549
the if found please call the sign and

00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:59,220
then I went away from the acrylic one

00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:02,430
the acrylic platform because the one on

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,750
the center actually sort of broke into a

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,569
million pieces when I hit the ground

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:10,470
hard so I then tried a paper craft one

00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:11,879
which unfortunately is not it's not as

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,459
dirty as I would have thought it would

00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,989
have been but so anyway so then I tried

00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,750
the very last one which is the current

00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:21,959
ones I have here which is a little piece

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,209
of wood and essentially what happens is

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,099
as the kite line goes up this will sort

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,530
of just go up with it because it's like

00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:33,810
super light and it will start taking

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:36,959
kozol to ground so I wrote two pieces of

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,639
code Python and Perl the reason why I

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,409
wrote Python instead of Perl and I

00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,069
realize that this is a pro conference is

00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:48,389
that the Raspberry Pi has a large Python

00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:54,510
code base just natively so I basically

00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:58,109
learned how to do Python it's somewhere

00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:04,379
concepts I mean if anyone can do Perl 6

00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:08,729
you can definitely do Python so what the

00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:10,709
Python code does is basically we there

00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:13,109
is on the slew there is something called

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,720
a sunset which it has a fuller ometer

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:17,849
built in so you can sort of check to see

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,250
what it's shaking and when it's worth

00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:22,650
it's a sort of stable and polite it's

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,600
like oh I'm not shaking and it takes a

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,420
photo so

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,760
magically it all works the Perl code I'm

00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,610
using that on startup to see if there's

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,590
a USB drive attached to the Raspberry Pi

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,880
and if it does it copies all the files

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,180
over in the Nexus

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,180
so it works and the code is available

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,980
under MIT license not really something

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,610
super predicate for the pro conference

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,610
but there is a lava

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:54,680
[Applause]

00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,680
