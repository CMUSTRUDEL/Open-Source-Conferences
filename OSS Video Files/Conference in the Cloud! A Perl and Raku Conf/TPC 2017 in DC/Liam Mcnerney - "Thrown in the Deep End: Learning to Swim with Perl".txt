Title: Liam Mcnerney - "Thrown in the Deep End: Learning to Swim with Perl"
Publication date: 2017-06-23
Playlist: TPC 2017 in DC
Description: 
	In 2012 I was freelancing as a PHP/MySQL developer and knew practically nothing about Perl. I took a PHP job with a company and, within two weeks, was writing Perl code for an enterprise application. This talk discusses my experience getting thrown in the deep end and learning to love Perl.

I'm an East Coast native currently living in the Great Plains. I became a developer about twelve years ago working on mainframe applications in COBOL; since then I've done stints as a freelance web designer, backend developer, and for several years taught computer science at a small university. I'm now a Perl developer acting as technical lead for an Enterprise application.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,540
good morning this is a little bit of a

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,690
departure I'm not doing a technical

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:14,299
lecture this is more of a story about

00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:17,400
how I shifted from being a person who

00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:19,770
worked as a programmer to becoming

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,859
someone who programmed as an avocation

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:27,510
someone who fell in love with it and

00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:31,800
Perl was really central to that so my

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,890
career arc was kind of odd right out of

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,620
college I got a job with a bank doing

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,710
software development in COBOL I did that

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,800
for several years before transitioning

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,950
into teaching computer science at a

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,700
university I did that for several years

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,559
as well

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,260
whole variety of different things

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,860
Microsoft version of people but c-sharp

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,770
some UNIX stuff and security and that

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:03,539
was fun and and on the side I had picked

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,850
up PHP so I started doing some some lamp

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,590
work on the side just little freelance

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:17,759
gigs and that was fun too for a while

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:21,229
but by 2011 I was feeling stagnant and I

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,729
was also feeling kind of lopsided I

00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:27,229
looked at my career and realized that I

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:32,759
had basically done some really ish stuff

00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:34,560
you know academia is nice COBOL go take

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,659
a look at COBOL table things and you can

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,170
tell me if that's nice if you can find

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,570
them and I knew that there were a lot of

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,909
common practices in software development

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,310
that I wasn't aware of there were tools

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,970
like git that I had not heard of but not

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:55,619
used and there were skills that I felt I

00:01:50,970 --> 00:02:01,909
was lacking so I made another transition

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,909
from teacher back to programmer

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,040
in 2012 I got a job with a software

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,990
company in Minneapolis they had this

00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,950
project this internal project that had

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,530
started with their insulting who wanted

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,300
to understand why installs failed what

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:25,590
were the issues customers were facing

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:29,420
and what could be done to fix it and so

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,770
they built this this two-part

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,140
application to find out they had a

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,240
client-side agent which would sweep up

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,120
install logs and some config information

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,490
and ship it back and a server side

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,860
component that would parse that incoming

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:47,610
data and put the interesting bits into

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,160
the database and the manager had dreams

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,810
of putting a reporting server on top of

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,709
that so that people could go to a web

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:59,340
site and see this data but the insulting

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:01,950
got busy they had higher priority things

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,450
to do than this project so they opened a

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,720
wreck and they went to hiring and they

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,900
found me and I was really excited about

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,150
this because this was getting into a

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,269
software company where I could learn the

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:17,519
kinds of things I wanted to learn it was

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:18,930
an interesting project I liked the

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,220
people I'd met during an interview

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,080
process all of this was great

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:28,320
the only thing that gave me pause in

00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,150
this was that I would also be

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,850
responsible for doing maintenance from

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,299
the two existing components both of

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:40,320
which were written in Perl I had touched

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,670
Perl a little bit in college I hadn't

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,890
really stuck with me most of what I

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:48,480
learned was it allowed some really odd

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,980
things like postfix tests and magic

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,120
variables that could mean different

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,780
things in different contexts

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,150
I remembered the idiosyncrasies but I

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,739
hadn't really done anything much with it

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,910
since and it wasn't something I reached

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,890
for day-to-day but I could read it after

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,730
a fashion and I was really interested in

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:13,260
doing the big shiny PHP stuff so I

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:15,330
figured no problem my expectation was

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,070
that I would get in and start building

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,060
out that reporting server and I'd be

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,120
able to focus on that

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,800
for a while and then I would shift over

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,550
to whatever maintenance work there was

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,910
in the pearl that expectation died my

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,370
second week my manager came in and said

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,220
hey now you're through all your new hire

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,080
stuff you need to go and extend the

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,520
processing because there's a lot of

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,960
stuff coming in that's not going into

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,190
the database and that's what I want you

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,930
to build reports on so before I even got

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,770
to the fun shiny stuff that was already

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:50,790
in my wheelhouse

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,710
I was pivoting to work in pearl but I

00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,600
figure this is a learning experience and

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,590
this is something I want to do broaden

00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:02,100
my skills so I checked out the code and

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:05,910
started going through it and started

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:10,020
getting this sinking feeling as I looked

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:12,210
through this application now my previous

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,340
experience with applications I mean this

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,080
was a small application but it was a lot

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,270
bigger than anything you normally do in

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,840
academia unless you were working on a

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:25,680
huge project most of what you saw were

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,800
sample programs and the code I'd worked

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,520
with at the bank so I worked at the

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,039
COBOL I mean that was built to run for

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:40,740
decades it was waterfall from stem to

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:43,200
stern and exhaustively documented and

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,740
and everything in lines with the coding

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:52,860
standards that were codified ha ha in

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:55,410
three huge binders of printout so that's

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,240
what I was used to and then I started

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:01,470
looking through this program and this

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:05,060
was not like that hey it was well

00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:08,070
designed it was very well designed it

00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,680
you know utility functions were

00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,960
logically organized into packages and

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,780
the packages were in a hierarchical

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,000
structure they were using an ORM for a

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,190
lot of the database stuff and I wasn't

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,460
familiar with an lrm but in principle I

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:26,330
understood what it was doing and the

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:29,390
code itself was pretty easy to read

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:34,040
until I got to the

00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:35,300
the main method that did all the parse

00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:41,960
the data and put it into the database

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:45,170
logic that was a 700 plus line

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:50,980
subroutine of deeply nested conditional

00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:56,420
logic and so sprinkled with a dozen of

00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:58,760
database object calls which again we're

00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,370
very useful and standardized the code a

00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:05,540
lot but to my inexperience I they look

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:07,070
like so much clutter I started digging

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,930
through it took a couple days just to

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,450
untangle some of the some of the

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:15,350
variable scope for things I was going to

00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:20,960
need and I started to worry that I had

00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:23,290
gotten in a little TV but I made a

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,600
couple small edits and they worked I

00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:28,520
added a table to the database and Bill

00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,740
Pell processing for it and it worked and

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,380
I started to get a little more confident

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:38,390
with it it was it was a big unknown but

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:41,030
I was starting to find my way and of

00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,500
course I ran into issues and you asked

00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,720
to Google for help and sometimes it's

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,470
helpful and sometimes it's not the big

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,940
help I got was from my colleagues and

00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:54,980
this is when I really started to see

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:57,230
curl as something on its own rather than

00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:01,250
just another tool that might be in the

00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:05,810
toolbox when I went to my colleagues for

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:08,810
help they were very patient they were

00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:11,420
very generous with their time they

00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:15,560
provided a lot of context around what I

00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:18,110
was doing and why one solution worked

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,750
and another one kidney and I thought

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,730
this was really important my experience

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,210
when I was teaching was the context with

00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:28,760
everything we we think we learn by

00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:31,220
memorizing facts but we really don't we

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,800
take fact and we put them into a story

00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,080
we make a narrative that tells us how

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,770
those facts work and that's how we learn

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,540
and that's what I always try to do when

00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,730
I was teaching and that's what my

00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:47,530
colleagues were helping me do

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:51,070
and then one of them pointed me towards

00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:56,440
pearl monks and that oh there was only

00:08:51,070 --> 00:09:01,150
the one side anyway that was that was

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:06,150
remarkable also have you ever gone into

00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:09,190
an online community forum whatever and

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:12,010
someone comes in some poor newbie with

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,990
some question that you know six months

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,730
in everybody knows the answer but this

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,770
person did they come in and they ask the

00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,710
question and they immediately get shut

00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:24,180
down with RTFM did you even look at the

00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,180
documentation before you bothered us

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,570
yeah don't you know how to Google and

00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,130
that didn't really appeal to me I never

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,320
engaged with those so I hadn't really

00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:38,050
gone looking for some online resource

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:43,240
for pearl until I got hung at the Pearl

00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:45,430
monks and pearl monks was different that

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,200
was a larger community of what I was

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,470
already experiencing with my colleagues

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,470
people who did not just shut you down

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:55,900
even if it was a simple question were

00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:59,560
courteous generous genuinely tried to

00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,280
help and if someone said go read the

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,710
manual

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:08,560
they usually included a link to the

00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:12,010
manual and I began to see pearl in light

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:16,240
of this community it's a little bit like

00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:18,700
I realized it was a little bit like

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,250
walking up to a campfire on a really

00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,780
cold night just that that welcoming

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,810
sense I started to get that from the

00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:28,540
Pearl community but the thing that

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:31,630
really encouraged me was that this work

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:34,120
to extend this processing node was going

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,870
very fast it was going much faster than

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,550
I would have expected far sooner than I

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,709
anticipated that work was done

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,110
all the all the necessary items were

00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:47,209
going into the database and I could turn

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:53,029
around and go back to the fun stuff the

00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:55,490
PHP the website and that's what I did

00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:57,860
for for the next few months just solid

00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,110
PHP building out the website building

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:05,649
the reports for this database database

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:09,230
queries yadda yadda yadda and then about

00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:11,589
five months in my manager stopped by

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,480
again and said now that that's running I

00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:19,490
need you to shift over and start

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,050
expanding the client-side agent there's

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,880
other things that we want to get so that

00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:24,829
we can understand what issues are

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,940
happening and so you need to go and

00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:31,610
build that so that this was an order of

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:35,060
magnitude larger than what I done with

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:36,470
the processing this was not just

00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:42,339
building on something that was already

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:46,040
there this was brand new brand new work

00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:48,140
but the the client-side agent had been

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,630
designed from the start to be extensible

00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,070
it had a frame plug-in framework so I

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,649
was just building another plugin for

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,050
that and I could take the the basic

00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:59,000
framework structure and and have that

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:04,250
build very quickly and then start

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,620
expanding on it after that it was more

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:11,060
research and asking my colleagues for

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:13,430
help and and at that time I got pointed

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,920
towards Sipan for something I don't even

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:18,560
remember what I had I had encountered

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,120
some problem and I'd be able to write

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,899
the code around it but it was going to

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,610
take me at least a week and one of my

00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:29,180
colleagues said hey go take a look at

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:31,370
this module on Sipan so I pulled it down

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:36,589
and tried it in a little test script and

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:40,190
it worked and I put it into the new code

00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:41,540
I was building and it worked and it it's

00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,920
one of those things where you know the

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,750
value of something like Sipan in the

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,310
abstract but until you start using it

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,160
you don't really appreciate how much

00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,750
time it saves you or how much confidence

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,579
it gives you in your own code

00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,500
because you're not just relying on this

00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:57,750
this week's worth of code that you

00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,389
hacked together to do something you're

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:04,019
relying on a module that in this case

00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:08,430
had tests had been around for a while

00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:10,500
and was reliable I could have more faith

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:13,250
in the quality of my code because I

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,029
could build on the quality of other code

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:21,139
and again that work went very quickly

00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:26,910
and I started to realize something

00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:32,579
during this process well realize has

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:35,250
anyone heard that PHP has some issues so

00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:38,000
I had heard that but when I started

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:40,949
learning it and it was all self-taught

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,769
PHP was also great because it was really

00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:45,839
fast to pick up and I could get stuff

00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:48,000
done fairly quickly in it which is not

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,889
the case in COBOL I don't know if

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,230
anyone's even tried to do web stuff in

00:13:49,889 --> 00:14:00,180
COBOL of course somebody has tried to do

00:13:52,230 --> 00:14:03,509
it so I I'd known about those things

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,639
like yes it has poor error handling and

00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:09,149
yes there are inconsistent variable

00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:12,930
names and yes yes yes yes yes but by the

00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:14,670
time I gotten to this company I was

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,589
familiar enough with PHP that those were

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,970
kind of invisible to me the weeds had

00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:25,639
grown up I couldn't see the potholes

00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:28,470
anymore but now I had just done a

00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,839
several weeks working very solidly in

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:34,670
Perl getting my feet wet with it and

00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:38,100
then done this chunk of PHP work and

00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:42,569
then shifted again into another solid

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,639
block of Perl and I became very aware of

00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:55,800
how I felt during each of those

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:58,949
processes PHP hurt it it was like trying

00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,269
to Ford a river across a fast rushing

00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:02,970
stream and you're trying to go that way

00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:04,800
anything I wanted to do I had to try and

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,230
hammer pH

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,920
into the shape I wanted it to be to get

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:13,709
my work done I always felt like I was

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:17,249
writing too many lines of code to do

00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:19,550
something and even after several rounds

00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:24,269
of refactoring and code reviews and

00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:26,249
feedback it never felt clean it never

00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:33,420
felt concise it always felt like bad

00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:36,379
code whereas with Perl I could be as

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:39,239
concise as verbose as I wanted to I

00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:41,639
could turn the verbosity up to 11 and I

00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:44,009
could still follow what I was doing and

00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:48,179
when I went through and refactored

00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:51,119
everything always got cleaner and it

00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:59,189
always felt easier to read any easier to

00:15:51,119 --> 00:16:03,299
maintain that project took about two or

00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:04,709
three months from start to finish and by

00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:09,869
the end of it I was a pretty dedicated

00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:13,619
Perl developer because pearl worked with

00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:15,600
me for the first experience I'd had as a

00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:17,459
programmer I wasn't working against the

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,240
language I was using the language was

00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:24,089
helping me I've done a lot of other

00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,799
things with Perl since then you know got

00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:27,799
into unit testing and TDD and

00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:32,429
object-oriented development and all

00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:35,459
sorts of other things but that's been

00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:39,019
really consistent the language has

00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:41,549
always helped me it always made me feel

00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:43,379
like I'm writing something that's

00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:50,549
effective I've always been happy with it

00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:52,980
at the end of the day and that's that's

00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:56,579
really the whole point of the story is

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:59,879
that I did get thrown in the deep end I

00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:01,619
had to learn this at speed there wasn't

00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:04,289
a lot of time between when I got there

00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:08,510
and when things had to but Perl

00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:12,599
helped me spend thank you

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,599
[Applause]

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:28,180
I think there's time for one or two if

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:30,010
anyone has one yeah um yeah well that's

00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:33,550
about the time I realized that the Pearl

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:37,030
was the hyung stuff PHP wasn't fun at

00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:38,950
all it is for now but we're doing a a

00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:44,559
complete rewrite of that and it's going

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:46,450
away parts of it are going to be pearl

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,280
I mean we're changing everything on it

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,080
we're changing the under underlying

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,460
database we're changing the whole

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,460
architecture of the application

00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:08,000
have to migrate the old data if we don't

00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:10,340
want to so we can just cut over and keep

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,610
going but the nice thing there is we

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,980
have all the old data so if we want to

00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,500
we can repopulate into this with very

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,760
little difficulty a few days because

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,570
it's not a migration it would be a

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,570
reprocess

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,689
[Laughter]

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,689
[Music]

00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:29,780
what I would I'm glad to know it that

00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:53,280
would be answered I have to say that I

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,860
think Stack Overflow has actually done a

00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:00,510
really good job of regularizing that

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:02,580
across different languages and the level

00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:08,870
of courtesy there is much higher than

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:08,870
you see on some language specific fora I

00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:30,200
didn't have anything to protect any and

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,200
