Title: Liam Mcnerney - "Thrown in the Deep End: Learning to Swim with Perl"
Publication date: 2017-06-23

Description: 
	In 2012 I was freelancing as a PHP/MySQL developer and knew practically nothing about Perl. I took a PHP job with a company and, within two weeks, was writing Perl code for an enterprise application. This talk discusses my experience getting thrown in the deep end and learning to love Perl.

I'm an East Coast native currently living in the Great Plains. I became a developer about twelve years ago working on mainframe applications in COBOL; since then I've done stints as a freelance web designer, backend developer, and for several years taught computer science at a small university. I'm now a Perl developer acting as technical lead for an Enterprise application.
