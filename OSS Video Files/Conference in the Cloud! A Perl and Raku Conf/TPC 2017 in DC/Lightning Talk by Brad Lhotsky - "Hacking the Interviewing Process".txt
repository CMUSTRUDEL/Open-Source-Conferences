hello tipsy Brad lotzie I'm here to talk

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,649
to you a little bit about hacking the

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,990
interview process so blame everything

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,210
you're about to hear on me doesn't

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,280
represent my employer this is all about

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:18,000
my experiences interviewing and being an

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,369
interviewer Dave did a 50-minute talk on

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,090
the entire hiring process if you didn't

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,519
see it

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,720
I highly recommend that you and anyone

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,019
that's involved in hiring in your

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,309
company actually watch that video it was

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,329
fantastic different backgrounds

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:35,219
different perspectives and different

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,620
experiences helped the process you'll

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,450
get more well rounded hires able to work

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,309
in a diverse environment ensure your

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,610
hiring team reflects the diversity you

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,079
want to see in the company

00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,239
we're generally not good at soft skills

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,680
without training to understand how to

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,690
communicate effectively you'll miss out

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,789
on great candidates there may be legal

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,920
issues as well you need to be aware of

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,840
federal state and local employment laws

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,670
as they pertain to interviewing and

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,100
discrimination if you're really not

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,260
comfortable with interviewing step aside

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,360
you will put off candidates if you

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,200
haven't had the training talk to HR

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,549
about getting it before you proceed read

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,860
the Job Description

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,810
you may disagree with what that job

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,189
description says that's fine but that's

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,140
what the company has said they want to

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,369
hire for this will ensure you're asking

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,420
the right questions and you stay on

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:27,869
track in the interview read the

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,180
candidates resume read the candidates

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,040
resume

00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,329
figure out what experiences best reflect

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,650
the requirements of the job description

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,470
that you just read

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,329
seriously don't Google stop them Twitter

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,670
and Facebook have made this a dangerous

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,680
game you may end up tripping into

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,110
protective information on the candidate

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,299
if you do you have to remove yourself

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,040
from the interviewing process if you

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,229
don't know what protected information is

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,990
you haven't received the proper training

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,790
on interviewing talk to your fellow

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,770
interviewers talk about the issues you

00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,969
have with the job requirements possible

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,619
issues you have with the candidates

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,149
qualifications based on any

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,770
pre-screening that has occurred so far

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,409
you want to save time as early in the

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,479
process as possible formulate a plan who

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:13,100
interviews with who what topics will be

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,750
covered which questions will be asked

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,970
pair up don't overwhelm the candidate

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,830
with six people on the table it's not

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,850
fair to either side of the table because

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,530
you need to give everyone the

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,910
opportunity to contribute if you want

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,190
six people to talk to the candidate

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,700
maybe three 30-minute interview sessions

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,050
are better than on three 30-minute

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,760
interview sessions with two people are

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,950
better than one interview session that's

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,650
one hour and a half long with six people

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,420
in the room make sure if you do pair up

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,790
that you pair up with someone that you

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:46,560
work well with you want to show a good

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:49,200
working relationship be humble be kind

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,970
be generous you are the first real

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,130
exposure to the company and possibly

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,930
your team that this candidate has don't

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,670
forget that the candidate is going to

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,660
have to want to work with you and your

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,910
team if you choose to accept them make

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,290
the candidate comfortable it's your

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,120
responsibility to foster an environment

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,580
where the candidate can be the best

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,890
version of themselves don't ask a single

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,390
question that has a right answer trust

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,490
me you don't care if the candidate

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,580
memorized the man page or knows why a

00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,220
manhole cover is round work with the

00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,750
candidate through the interview process

00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:26,430
find out what it's like to collaborate

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:28,860
not confront them your process isn't

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,230
perfect perform interview post mortems

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,370
after every interview with everyone

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,830
involved in the process

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,590
HR phone screens everyone in the

00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,690
face-to-face what worked what didn't how

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,270
can you improve it the better you filter

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,380
earlier in the process the happier

00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:52,230
you're going to be with interviewing

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:55,320
that's the talk this is let's start step

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,840
one as a lightning advertisement I just

00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,610
like to say if you haven't ever

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,140
submitted a talk for a conference that

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,360
this is probably one of the most

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,340
welcoming and accepting audiences that

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,620
you'll ever come across there are tons

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,239
of resources available to you if you're

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,330

00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,270

to work for don't lie on your CV but

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,500

demonstrates that you satisfy the job

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,930

that I've done on the company and I

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,780
updated after every step in the

00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:56,860
interview process with notes that I've

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:58,930

the interview is acceptable any more

00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,070
than that and you're kind of

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,070
inconveniencing the whole entire team

for feedback after you answer a question

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,290
saying something like do you need more

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,240
details about something I just mentioned

00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,669
might be the difference between you

00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,919
getting the job and not be comfortable

00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:56,440
saying I don't know but follow it up

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,389
with a relation to something that you do

00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,730
know and how you would find out more

00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:03,610
don't say I google it and then stop

00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,080
talking because great so can i I want to

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,840
know how you're proud of your thought

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,610
process works I google it as a financier

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,229
but make sure it's I google it and

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,970
here's what I do well and here's what I

00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:16,270
do when I find this it's a perfectly

00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:18,070
acceptable way of working always ask

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,690
questions this is your hedge against bad

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,180
interviewers there are a lot of bad

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,830
interviewers the only way that you will

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,639
get a job if there's a bad interviewers

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:29,710
if you ask that ask questions ensure

00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,660
they understood all of the explanations

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,919
that you've given was there an area that

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,880
they thought you were weakened that you

00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,800
actually have a lot of technical

00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,510
experience but you've held back because

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,669
you don't want to overwhelm them ask do

00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,950
you need more details always have

00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:43,990
questions ready for anyone who asks for

00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,669
a question if I'm an interviewer and I'm

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,940
asking you do you have any questions for

00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:51,520
me yes I do because if you say no great

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,200
I'm not going to hire you asking

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,600
questions about interviewers personal

00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,550
experiences is a great way to be able to

00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,440
have one or two questions ready to go at

00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,300
any point in time and then just simply

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,490
re ask that same question to each person

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,830
some examples are what do you like about

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,990
working here if you could change one

00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,370
thing about your team about your company

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,139
about your culture what would it be

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,789
those answers are going to be different

00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:14,770
from every single person and they're

00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:16,090
going to be incredibly valuable to you

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,419
in determining whether it's a good fit

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,419
for you

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,560
take notes early and often if you're

00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,780
hired you may be able to help make the

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,310
process a lot better and if you apply

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,020
for a position with the company again in

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,220
the future and like me you completely

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,409
forget that you interviewed with that

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,029
company you'll have some notes available

00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,010
to you to understand why it didn't work

00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:39,610
out the first time and that may save you

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:41,050
a lot of time what's interesting what

00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,789
I'd like to do is capture job

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,320
descriptions as they appear that's

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,209
interesting because you can see how job

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,920
descriptions evolve over time and see if

00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:51,160
a company is moving towards or away from

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,230
the version that you would like to be

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,910
and Baba I'll try to have fun

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,290
interviewing is stressful I would think

00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,120
about how lucky I am to meet so many

00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,440
people in the interview process on

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,900
either side of the table

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,970
you can have fun in the process you can

00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,460
improve things and make it a great place

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,350
to work

00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,710
Thanks

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,010
[Applause]

00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,070
