Title: Philip Hood - "Basic Autonomous Driving Research"
Publication date: 2017-06-24
Playlist: TPC 2017 in DC
Description: 
	I had been lately hearing a bit about, but never studied, robotics more generally, and autonomous driving in particular and wondered if I could create some smaller instance of this using commodity tools - something like an inexpensive remote controlled car - purchased off the shelf, by using sensors (a camera) on the device, and having input from the camera be used to navigate the device, in "real-time," so to speak. In this talk I discuss my experiences and detail a bit about the code, various algorithms investigated, and other things I tried along the way.
