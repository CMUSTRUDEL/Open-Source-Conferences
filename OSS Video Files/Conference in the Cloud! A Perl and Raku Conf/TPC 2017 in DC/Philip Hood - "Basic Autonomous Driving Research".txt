Title: Philip Hood - "Basic Autonomous Driving Research"
Publication date: 2017-06-24
Playlist: TPC 2017 in DC
Description: 
	I had been lately hearing a bit about, but never studied, robotics more generally, and autonomous driving in particular and wondered if I could create some smaller instance of this using commodity tools - something like an inexpensive remote controlled car - purchased off the shelf, by using sensors (a camera) on the device, and having input from the camera be used to navigate the device, in "real-time," so to speak. In this talk I discuss my experiences and detail a bit about the code, various algorithms investigated, and other things I tried along the way.

basic autonomous driving research thank

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,720
you

00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:26,160
so I don't want to get people to excited

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,400
we're not driving on you know the

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,610
highway or anything like that I just

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,739
have an example of I guess the sequence

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,600
of subproblems that sort of existed and

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,579
as a sort of storyline that I sort of

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,170
tell behind this while trying to do some

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,420
research for to something else that

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:48,390
that's sort of a different sort of

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:50,430
problem and and then this came out of an

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,110
instance of trying to perhaps prove

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,180
something else and I thought that it's

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,190
as interesting enough of a problem that

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,109
perhaps could be discussed or looked at

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,420
or what have you and and I've got a

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:04,140
bunch of data here and I present things

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,150
and obviously I I don't have a I don't

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,220
study robotics or anything I kind of got

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,890
to start as a sort of web programmer

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,409
programmed Perl for webpages and all the

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,810
sort of stuff but then over time have

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,740
been looking at sort of other instances

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,170
of issues that you can use for you can

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,700
use programming to kind of solve and

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,490
what happens so in this case all we're

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:31,320
doing really is we have a device which I

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:35,189
brought a an example of which has a

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,990
sensor and has a camera and in a

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:40,850
real-time fashion what we're hoping to

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,829
do is to take a picture literally with

00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,659
the sensor and you can perhaps more

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,390
largely write this as having many

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,070
different forms of sensors and then to

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:56,299
in a real fantastic drive the device

00:01:50,070 --> 00:02:01,040
given input from those sensors so anyway

00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:05,969
we have a through D CPM a web server

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,409
called pros org and anyone in theory in

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,550
the Perl community or perhaps not going

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,489
in the pro community could get an

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,739
account so I wanted to put some papers

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,780
or whatever you want to call them there

00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,730
so the web server again is burrow shot

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,069
award

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,950
it's PTH my name is Philip can be hood

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:24,120
and I just put some papers there so

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:29,849
essentially all I'm going to do is just

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,319
read through the text that I have show

00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,360
you a little bit of data and then talk

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,459
about it if anyone's really kind of

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,970
interested and examine some of the

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:44,190
subproblems that obviously come up too

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:47,250
and it's an mp4 file it just kind of

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:50,810
shows you the coursing of this thing

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:55,079
this little drone by this company parrot

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,910
kind of coursing around a blue piece of

00:02:55,079 --> 00:03:01,680
painters tape that I've put on the floor

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:05,579
in my lovely apartment and in happen as

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,409
it kind of makes its way around a circle

00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:10,470
a few things that's happening of course

00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:14,129
but essentially again it's taking a

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:17,340
picture right it is transmitting that

00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:19,200
picture to a laptop over a Wi-Fi

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,470
connection if the device when it starts

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,660
creates a hotspot you read the file

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,489
there's a few ways that you could read

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,310
the file but what I discovered was that

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:33,359
it's fun

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:35,489
slower and more verifiable or perhaps

00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:38,970
deterministic in order to create a

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:42,030
picture and then yank it from the device

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,889
using FTP as opposed to another thing

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,900
that you could do which is it has video

00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:49,019
feed so to speak a video feed but it's

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,870
really a sort of still it's a sequence

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,780
of still JPEG images that that you would

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,900
get and the problem with it in this case

00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,269
is that it varies it could in theory do

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,160
up to I believe 16 frames per second but

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,650
frequently did not and under certain

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,629
conditions that frame sequence would

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,609
slow down would go down to 12 or

00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:12,419
what-have-you so my first thought of

00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:14,489
course was to read in it while going

00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,340
read the you know pictures and try to

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,789
drive it perhaps very quickly and again

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,560
I'm just

00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:21,030
others who are kind of interested in

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,979
this problem it looks like it oh this is

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,690
a quite interesting problem you know to

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,410
buy the device it happens to be very

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,710
cheap that was chosen for

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,240
cheapness and so without further ado

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,700
I'll just kind of read through the text

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,410
and some of this I've obviously already

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,080
just repeated but but I'll repeat it

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:42,970
again and again you can download more

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,410
information so there's now historic this

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,010
work was kind of primarily done last

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:50,650
summer and my hope was that I would have

00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,330
something verifiable and kind of

00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,550
provable so to speak and then I would

00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,490
take it to I was traveling around Europe

00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:00,190
and I want to do to the Alpine Swiss I

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,600
did go to the Al Capone Swift's Perl

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,550
conference and then present something

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,200
there but I just didn't have everything

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,150
work in fact it this video was shot

00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,830
right you know like two days before I

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,660
actually left but I didn't have time to

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,430
write it all up and do everything else

00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,710
so then I was like okay then I'll just

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,980
attend it and you know kind of take it

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:20,940
later and so then in February I went

00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:25,960
down to DC p.m. which is really my home

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:29,050
Perl organization and did some things

00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,510
there got some feedback and so that's

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,060
why this is dated on in January and then

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,080
based on some feedback that I got I

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,750
decided I would make just a slight

00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,330
handful of changes and so there's

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,950
another update to this page done just a

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,250
few days ago and I'll kind of go over

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,020
that if obviously this time so I had a

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,720
number of motivations those motivations

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,400
really were how does one determine if it

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,860
is possible to come up with a sort of

00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:58,840
computational understanding of morality

00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:02,470
and in this case a number of people were

00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:05,110
talking about the very interesting sort

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:08,740
of quote-unquote trolley problem what do

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,230
you do if you are a driver you're a

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,490
robot driver of a trolley and the

00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,950
trolley sees a handful of different

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,750
things right before it sees you know and

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,490
it must crash and I mean it you know

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,400
something occurs in a bus crash and

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,840
you've got a young baby here and two old

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,060
people walking across the street and

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,800
perhaps a dog in the middle of the

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,270
street and it must make some sort of

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,560
decision and how could you come with

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:35,020
some form of computational algorithm

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,700
that that could make help it make

00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,270
decisions and there are a number of

00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,699
groups that are now trying to produce

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,080
very papers and some knowledge on this

00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,090
so I thought okay this is the kind of

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,310
like a very interesting problem how

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:51,229
would one begin to solve that and while

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,229
talking with someone else

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,130
I sort of flippantly said well it is a

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,900
trivial problem to just take a device

00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,030
and just drive it I mean this is a very

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,130
well-known problem it's in fact been

00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,710
solved you know is varying examples of

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,300
this in the 60s and elsewhere of just

00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,009
reading input you know and driving the

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,750
rover or what have you in some sort of

00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:10,680
autonomous fashion so then they were

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,300
like well prove it

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,669
right I mean if you say it's trivial

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,349
then just do it and I said well sure

00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:18,419
I'll do it alright okay this is you know

00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:21,360
fine so so let me just go ahead and do

00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:24,150
it and then my sort of troubles sort of

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,810
began all right I mean and it is just

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,580
certain extended it's not a I wouldn't

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,860
say it's trivial but I'll present to you

00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,340
the things that I kind of discovered and

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,330
how I kind of solved it you know

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,919
honestly doing these things in real time

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,620
fashion moving at the 60 miles per hour

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,900
like you know or more I think would be

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,789
very interested and worth worth

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,719
someone's time that I mean a real you

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:47,490
know anyway

00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:49,159
so the mere question was rape can i

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:54,360
programmer working even trivial

00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:56,039
autonomous lee piloted vehicle and so at

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,080
first I thought well what I'll do is

00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll buy one of these drones and I'll

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,070
buy a you know one of these little

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,050
copters that kind of goes around and in

00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:08,610
fact this code or in Perl on Sipan that

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,280
shows that it gives you driver and all

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,080
the sort of stuff in that case however a

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,270
lot of these devices don't have cameras

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,169
and the cameras if they did have them

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,669
are usually not very good and so then I

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:23,639
thought well what I'll do is I'll attach

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:25,050
a camera ok so then you start to

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,849
question well what is the weight of the

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,139
camera and you know what's the quality

00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:30,630
and how you transmitting information

00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:32,159
back and forward these things are

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,450
actually usually somewhat expensive

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,159
they're several hundreds of dollars and

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,659
for the scope of my project I you know I

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,099
just want to do easy things I'm not

00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,070
actually very interested in doing

00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:46,140
anything that's too complicated maybe I

00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,329
can make something myself I thought then

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,400
after kind of examining the price of

00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:54,160
some of these devices $1,000 2000

00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,540
you know we're not going to do that so

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,010
then I thought well maybe what I'll do

00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,600
is I'll buy a you know a

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:03,330
remote-controlled car from RadioShack

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:06,130
and what I'll do is I'll happen the

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,140
remote control device and I think that's

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,830
actually a fairly interesting way to go

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,180
is if someone is so inclined but then I

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,800
thought well and then you got a hack

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,830
this thing and then you still have to

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,290
attach a camera to it and all this sort

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:23,440
of stuff so is this now going to cost

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,390
more than $100 with $80 or whatever and

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,040
is it you know with spirit of the

00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,900
project which was just I have some fun

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,450
and I just sit down it come up with a

00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:34,840
problem and see how you could solve it

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:38,950
you know in a interesting sort of way

00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,750
okay even if trivial now I I did some

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,300
research and I found this device this is

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:46,720
the fourth one of these that I've now

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,610
purchased and I would name them you can

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,000
rename the Wi-Fi hotspot' it is

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,430
unencrypted with an application that you

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,250
get you download you put it on your

00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:59,220
iPhone if you have one of those name the

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,320
hotspot you later on they give you a

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,170
sort of a tool that allows you to drive

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,650
than the device so I said okay fine so

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:10,570
it's it's a it also has an open sort of

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,990
protocol in a document that it prints

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:18,400
out and an SDK the SDK is a CSV Jana has

00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:20,440
bindings from varying languages so I

00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,210
said fine okay and furthermore because

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,770
it's unencrypted and because there's a

00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,960
quote unquote open protocol then I can

00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:31,000
just sort of write my own little driver

00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,400
myself so if I don't you know if I don't

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,650
want to actually hack the application I

00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,110
can just recreate the protocol myself

00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,150
and in this case what you do is there's

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,830
some handshaking once you connect you

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,750
send some signals that tells you what

00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,450
what port is going to be reading on

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,850
reading off of and you know in most

00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,170
cases the work that I'm doing with you

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,000
know in the day to day basis and I'm

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,980
doing some back-end stuff on doing some

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,380
reading from databases I'm printing out

00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,790
some HTML and you know things like this

00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,260
collecting stuff in database never

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,510
anything that kind of deals with

00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,250
robotics so infrequently do I have to

00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,510
kind of create a server connect

00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,800
right two ports and all the sort of

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,990
stuff and therefore it's interesting

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,030
it's like okay this is now a new realm

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:13,780
of programming in it it kind of helps to

00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:15,190
stretch my knowledge how to space and I

00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,630
like that I mean you know it's kind of

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,790
interesting you can do this with Perl

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,740
doesn't have to be complicated Perl from

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,840
my perspective very easy language you

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,420
just try something thank you it's a

00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,010
great prototyping sort of thing you just

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:32,650
sit down okay it's a problem let me see

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:34,570
how I consult so of course I thought

00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,780
that what would be nice is to have the

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:40,990
entire sort of autonomous driving done

00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,520
on board and I think that would be the

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:49,330
sort of person class but let's say that

00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:51,040
there's a powerful enough CPU that's on

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,260
this that you can then we run a program

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,290
and just kind of plug it in but at this

00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,240
time there's no really easy facility

00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,180
that you can do this now it's open so

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,190
what you could do is you could in theory

00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,790
and others have done this you could take

00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:09,010
the entire OS for the parrot and then

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,990
you could begin to hack it and then you

00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,130
would have to then flash the drive and

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,140
all the sort of stuff and some other

00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,700
people have done that but again I think

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,560
it's sort of out of scope for the

00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,380
project I just want to do easy stuff I

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:23,500
don't want to I don't want to bend my

00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,870
mind and you know or even burn off the

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,040
device all right 100 bucks and let's say

00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,050
you have to do that now with your

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,880
thousand buck device now you're out of

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,640
thousand bucks now for me I wound up

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,220
having to purchase again this is the

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,960
fourth so in the first case one just

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,510
stopped working in the second case I did

00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,040
something and it just kind of ran up

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,290
against the corner and ran and ran and

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,110
ran and then finally when I picked it up

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,640
one you know we go wouldn't work you

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,230
know it all happened to happen fairly

00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,030
quickly so then I was able to take it

00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,890
back to the store and then kind of

00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:56,890
compliance that you know whatever didn't

00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,510
tell him I was doing basic autonomous

00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,700
driving research that I didn't tell him

00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,860
that but they've fine and then they gave

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,050
me another one and okay fine this one

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,390
happens to be the you know it was a year

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,250
passed and I hadn't taken a bunch of

00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,910
pictures and so forth and the devices

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:16,420
didn't work I was like what is this so

00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:19,870
anyway so I want to just do easy stuff

00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,130
and so then I found this little guy and

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,500
in fact the parent company it's the

00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,760
French company produces you know handful

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,370
of very interesting sort of things I

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,160
think all having this sort of open

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:35,200
protocol and and so forth some allow you

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,940
to drive with that you know using GPS

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,980
points and all that sort of stuff so

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,750
anyway just to sort of jump down what

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:48,010
happens is it's producing 640 by 480

00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:51,040
JPEGs and again you take a picture right

00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:54,130
and and then you take a look at what's

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,540
in your picture and you make some

00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,580
decision as to whether or not you'll go

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,040
left or right and perhaps whether or not

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:03,070
you'll go quickly left or quickly right

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,140
or will you go maybe not as much maybe

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,120
only 10 degrees 50 degrees or have you

00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,380
in my case I just boiled it down to

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,670
either I'll go straight left or right

00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:15,220
and I use constants for for that right

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,780
now you start to get into the whole

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,880
sequence of problems with this which is

00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:23,910
that if you're moving too quickly turns

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:26,500
out that the angle of the device

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,900
obviously you know there's like a cone

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:33,010
right that the light is traveling in and

00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:35,620
what will happen is in this case it's

00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:38,610
about I think 12 inches or perhaps a

00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:42,010
foot maybe only 8 that the light cone

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:45,310
falls over a horizon so in other words

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:47,020
you don't see with this camera angle you

00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,080
do not see anything that's closer to you

00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,280
then as closest 8 inches I think so if

00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,380
you're moving very quickly unless you

00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,070
have a sharp right turn as you see in

00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:58,240
this picture then if you don't make your

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,120
determination some of that you'll turn

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,830
before right in other words if you're

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,390
only moving five inches ahead and it's

00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,640
really the next frame that you really

00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:09,370
want to make your decision off of okay

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,160
so so but if you've moved five inches

00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:14,290
ahead because in this case as you can

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,030
see I'm actually trying to go straight

00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,710
right but I mean the line that's

00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:20,440
underneath me is straight but if I go

00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,650
another five inches then my next picture

00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,300
won't actually have any blue path ahead

00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,920
of me so that's a sort of problem so

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,930
then I thought well maybe one way to

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,040
solve it and in other devices the pair

00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:34,209
itself it allows

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:38,050
to change the angle of the camera fine

00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:40,389
so mine doesn't do this mine is only a

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,829
hundred bucks so what you I was like

00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:44,620
okay well I'll do is I'll just put a

00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:45,220
little camera so I got a bicycle helmet

00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,930
camp

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,339
I'm sorry not ken but a mirror so I'll

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,529
just put a little bicycle mirror there

00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:52,209
and then I'll just kind of maybe trying

00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:53,980
to focus now on that and that will get

00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:57,009
me directly underneath the device and

00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,120
and I said this is dumb you know it's

00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:01,480
just whatever

00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,550
I mean Izzy I don't have to do it that

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,050
way but but I wanted to you know again

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,579
now we're discussing the sequence of

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,529
problems that kind of come up with this

00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:10,930
particular approach and maybe someone

00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:13,959
else can solve it in some other way so

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:15,880
what I do is it's for at 40 by 480 but

00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:18,940
as you can see if you look at this is

00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:23,529
that a little short of half of the image

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:26,920
shows a horizon so I don't really care

00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:28,600
about anything that's over the 200 pixel

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,000
line if I'm if my orientation is from

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,170
the bottom left corner alright so so I

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,060
don't care anything about so I can just

00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:38,529
snip it off right so okay fine so then I

00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:41,740
snip it off now we say well okay well

00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:43,060
how do we then get the blue right now

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,480
then all these different ways that you

00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:49,180
can do blue now I'm jpg and the data is

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,610
stored as RGB values okay we've got only

00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,350
five minutes so I've only got RGB values

00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:58,449
so what I'll do is I'll just add some

00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:59,860
really basic filter so well what is blue

00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:02,380
of course well I think somehow

00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,150
complicated if you're in an RGB color

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,380
space so now you need to say well okay

00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,179
well how do we then calculated in

00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,679
college space turns out OpenCV which is

00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:10,390
the underlying library that I'm using

00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:13,419
here have some conversions from RGB to

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:16,360
open CVS okay fine so now you do some

00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:18,069
conversion to some other color space

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,659
okay so now you got to go out and study

00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:22,360
one you know different color spaces are

00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:25,480
so there's HSV somewhat complicated but

00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,850
I just filter out I say we'll find if

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,890
the hue is between so and so value and

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,990
if the saturations of it so and so value

00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,540
and if the vibrance is the social value

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:38,500
then okay so then we'll say we're blue

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:42,850
now it turns out that what's happening

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,540
is the camera is sensitive in varying

00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,780
areas

00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:49,000
so and things that reflects will reflect

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:51,070
and present itself to the camera and a

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,920
certain color so as you can see kind of

00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,750
like in the middle right of this image

00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,180
there's a flash of light perhaps coming

00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,400
from the Sun at a certain time so the

00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:04,210
flare around that now presents itself as

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,460
blue turns out that the vibrance level

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,820
is fairly high on that so you can now

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:12,310
begin to chop but what happens is if

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,870
you're doing this work at 12 o'clock May

00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,460
afternoon it's one thing but if you

00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:18,730
start doing it at like 8 o'clock it's

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,740
one thing and if you're using you know a

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,270
sodium rule in a lamp or whatever then

00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,310
your codes will present themselves in

00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:26,710
such and such a way so now you're saying

00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,990
well ok actually what is blue is not

00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,600
really blue I mean it's maybe it's

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,550
actually something else right and you've

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,970
got these six values that are saying

00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:38,800
okay well I'm hard-coded into this but

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,370
now it doesn't you know doesn't really

00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,780
do that so okay I then I shrink it and

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,040
do some other shrinking and then I say

00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,840
okay well how am I going to terminus

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,820
where I'm going to go so what I say well

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,180
okay well what I'll do is I'll just add

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:55,000
some sort of I'll just add some sort of

00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,740
like scaling which says that okay if you

00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,690
fall in this area but we'll multiply you

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,820
by a certain amount and then given the

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,680
weight of what that is I'll scan left

00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,890
and forward and something just simple

00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,810
and if you're in the front or you're in

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,230
the middle then that's where we'll wait

00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:12,940
but let's say that I've got blue in this

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,380
top-right region or top left region well

00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,930
then I don't really care about that and

00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,310
so you know and in this fashion I can

00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,680
say well let's go to the middle because

00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:23,110
this thing is really no just amalgam I

00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,280
just grabbed right who knows I mean you

00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,940
know you play with it and see what

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,500
happens giant um and here's a cute

00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,910
picture of you know like this is a

00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,180
device is kind of cool

00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:35,290
and remember there were some other

00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,790
things that I thought you know it was

00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:40,600
kind of cool which I won't really go

00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:44,140
into now but at the meeting some people

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,760
are really upset at the fact that you

00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,830
know when you take a look at this this

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,600
is what I grabbed with my filter based

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,740
on that image so they're like well maybe

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,010
even do something else you can come up

00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,810
with some sort of some sort of like AI

00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,850
way that you can train it or you can

00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,160
take it on a

00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,800
on first and then it would you know kind

00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:06,080
of like take the images maybe do some

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,080
kind of you know untrained unsupervised

00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,450
grouping of the colors and you could say

00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:16,590
oh okay you can you know APO I know that

00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:17,580
this is a blue as an example so I kind

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,070
of looked at that and I said okay fine

00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,350
let's take a look at some other color

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:25,620
spaces it turns out that lab is pretty

00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:28,950
good and there's a conversion at OpenCV

00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:32,780
and basically it's just two poles right

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:35,760
a and B and then and then a an l-value

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:39,390
okay so I think we're done and this now

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,940
shows the filter and and finally what I

00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:45,450
do is I put a place I make it plays a

00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:47,790
page which we will not be able to get

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:50,130
okay fine so it's going to load so now

00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:52,500
this is another example showing lab

00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:55,080
filtering and then I take the points I

00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,790
make boolean points out of them and then

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,590
I just display them and you can kind of

00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:03,860
see you know the before and after and

00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:06,840
there's one that's kind of interesting

00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:09,210
that's something you can kind of see

00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,460
these little star types of speckles off

00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:13,590
on the side again it's to show that even

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,480
now with this other form of filtering

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,760
you're still getting all these varying

00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,040
artifacts that you might still have to

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,840
deal with but you could say well what is

00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,280
the largest thing in my picture right I

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,810
mean you could begin to apply these

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,490
things but at the same time you kind of

00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:29,730
want to do it fairly quickly you want to

00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:31,470
do it it depending on how many frames do

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,060
you want to take and you want to drive

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,740
this thing if you want to do 30 frames

00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,870
per second you are in my case I'm doing

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,210
just about one frame per second two

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:41,670
frames per second I can do all the

00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:47,940
processing and about with my computer

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:50,610
one maybe what what like a tenth of a

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,790
second maybe a fifteenth of 0.15 of a

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:56,040
second or something I can get it to run

00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:58,290
there's some other interesting ones as

00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,120
you as I loop around the corner that I

00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:02,670
didn't take a picture of the entire

00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,890
thing here but I've got basically a

00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:10,290
semicircle and that's and you're just

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:13,020
seeing you're seeing cropped images

00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:15,000
and as you go around the corner you see

00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,250
that in different frames of light the

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,169
blue begins to change of course and the

00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,270
filtering is not working again as good

00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:23,070
especially as you get around this side

00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,679
of the corner and you can see in this

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,299
24th image you're getting less and less

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,710
information and then finally it kind of

00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,120
comes back again and these are all

00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,850
depending upon the reflections and so

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,350
forth and then finally you know if you

00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,840
go to the web page again you kind of

00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:39,390
look at everything there's some code you

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:43,440
know you can read it it's pretty basic

00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:46,080
code play with it you could come up with

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,840
your own so you don't like my ideas what

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,240
I will say is that finally spending time

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,419
sort of reverse engineering the protocol

00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,650
was actually are interesting because

00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:58,620
what I wound up having to do in order to

00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:01,320
have it take pictures is instead of

00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,510
getting the video feed which was a glut

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,530
of information the protocol also

00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:09,390
requires that you send signals to with

00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:11,429
account and all the sort of stuff to the

00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:13,049
device and if you don't do it at a

00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:15,330
certain amount of time then the device

00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:16,740
will begin to shut off which is I think

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,600
you get another problem when the device

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,630
gets hotter then it starts to take

00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,010
pictures that are sort of slower so if

00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,260
you don't have everything sort of

00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,549
regulated appropriately then you begin

00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,919
to have problems so now you have to do

00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:30,919
some sort of multi-threaded operation

00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:35,580
which is interesting I begin the thing

00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:38,040
finally in order to again you send a

00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,530
sequence of packets in a format so now

00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:43,830
you have into the pack world right which

00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:45,510
is interesting again and in order to sin

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,240
and when you're trying to discover the

00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:49,860
protocol you can read it but some it

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,390
doesn't really say well what's left and

00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:55,500
what's right so yeah you kind of have to

00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:57,270
discover this by osmosis and for the

00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,520
device to discover how I had to take

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,980
just a still frame of a picture

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,960
the application in the iPhone has a

00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,260
little button that takes a picture so in

00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,880
that case what you can do is you can

00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,740
connect to your device if you have a Mac

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,320
and then you can use something like

00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,240
Wireshark and then no basic basically

00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,470
given what you know you can begin to

00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,059
filter out the packets until you

00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,370
determine that the one packet is you

00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:21,870
don't know it's probably a one that is

00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:23,770
saying okay well now we're taking

00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,060
pictures so now you can have

00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:27,580
versus engineer this you can then wrap

00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,990
us into your program and then send it

00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,050
and see if in fact a picture is being

00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:37,290
taken and that's it

00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:40,630
so I will again show you the lovely

00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:43,540
coursing of the little joan around it

00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,950
it's very way kind of interests music oh

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,620
you feel the bounce to the left it'll

00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,420
bounce to the right they'll go forward I

00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,770
tried some blue I tried some green

00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:54,760
colors like maybe I'll just do different

00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:56,980
College so it turns out that you can see

00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,170
that the device has green lights all

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:02,110
right so those green lights on the floor

00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:03,340
now reflect green so if you have a you

00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,720
know something that's green now you have

00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,760
to figure out how to filter out and ring

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,380
also so now I got like two problems

00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,270
first the flares from the light or blue

00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,730
but now the you know the reflection from

00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,750
that lights are now green so my

00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,150
girlfriend was like well why don't you

00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:20,350
use red or you know use yellow with but

00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:22,720
okay so so there it is and this is

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,490
really fun and you could do it with you

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,850
know look a few languages but Perl you

00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:29,470
could do it with as well

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:32,280
I'll take C question I'm sorry for

00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,280
keeping you up

00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:47,940
point one that's right yes so I read the

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:51,550
image I converted from RGB to two to lab

00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:54,490
I then throw out information that I

00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:56,559
don't want so then there's a filter and

00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:00,490
then I do some sort of like calculation

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:02,020
determine and then I do a final pass to

00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,670
see who's got you know am I going left

00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:11,590
or right and I can do all that and point

00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:16,000
one fly I mean that right so I am not

00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:19,120
issue no I'm on a on a loop a VT alarmed

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,300
loop that will run every two or twice a

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,970
second I think is in this version that's

00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:27,520
right right so I get the information and

00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:29,679
I make my determination and now I've got

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,350
three you know point three point two

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,570
point three point two seconds to just

00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,580
you know sit on my butt basically and

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:40,960
then I issue another command having

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:43,090
having determined it so I in theory yes

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,120
in theory I mean I you know this worked

00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:48,280
and and it was like in it I spent a lot

00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,640
of time you know it you know it looks

00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,550
great it's I'm concerned but but yeah in

00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,870
theory you could be smooth you could use

00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:57,250
multiple computers right you can have

00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:00,340
one working to work at you know you

00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,630
could do all sort of stuff you could use

00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,580
cheap use to make that determination

00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,809
quickly you could you know they're all

00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:08,350
sort of things that in theory you could

00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:10,059
do but this is it's okay also I'm fixed

00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:11,860
right so I'm moving left and right and

00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:13,000
six you know or going straight at a

00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,490
fixed place you could make a

00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,920
determination to instead of going if

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,929
it's you could refine it as well and I'm

00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,480
going to leave that up to the community

00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:25,630
right yeah I could beat you Phil you

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,530
know right I love it I haven't want to

00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,530
sleep yeah

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:48,520
well so no because blue for RGB is like

00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:51,730
some of red is blue and some of blue flu

00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:58,179
is something Frank yeah I find it kind

00:27:51,730 --> 00:28:07,299
of weird to kind of yes you could do

00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:09,370
that I mean so by looking for edges

00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:12,549
normally I think what these guys do and

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:16,059
open in is they take the entire image

00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:17,980
and then they do a they calculate a

00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:19,330
gradient and then they recalculate it

00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,580
and all of a sort of stuff and then they

00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:25,000
determine where things are edges but

00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:26,679
edges of what in my case and that's fine

00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,240
and I'm not saying that I'm right or

00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:30,240
wrong I'm not I'm not saying that

00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:47,460
mhm yeah I agree I mean beat me that

00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,950
well just beat me just by the device is

00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,440
100 blocks and say Phil you don't know

00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:54,720
what you're doing you know we'll put it

00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,730
we'll come up with a course who goes

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,950
faster so the course and well you know

00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:01,820
and we'll meet next year yeah next one

00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,820
we will go for it

00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,049
right

00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:34,279
sounds like fightin words indeed

00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:35,690
it sounds like fightin words I agree

00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:39,709
yeah yeah I agree

00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:41,659
I I agree that there's algorithms that

00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:44,389
that work from those 60s I think the

00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:46,549
a-star algorithm was created to make

00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:48,889
this path right so so if these are all

00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:50,719
done issues and as I said as I was

00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:52,789
sitting around I was like just as you're

00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:54,859
saying I said this is trivial

00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:57,859
Vincent you know I was like hah this is

00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:59,209
a trivial problem to solve and and when

00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:01,700
I'm saying is okay so now you've got

00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:08,599
hardware you've got you know a bunch of

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:11,209
sub I agree I agree but in this case I

00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,859
didn't want to I'm not arguing with you

00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:15,109
here but in my case I just wanted to

00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:17,059
solve it myself using common sort of

00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:18,889
stuff without reading their stuff I

00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:20,419
didn't download I mean you know I looked

00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:23,389
at the protocol and all the stuff but I

00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:25,940
wasn't the goal was to figure out if I

00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:27,829
too could do it can I do it you know and

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:31,339
it's not and I found it to be fairly

00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:32,809
tough I mean you know in a certain way

00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:34,669
it was because of the way the device was

00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:37,339
riding the device it wasn't like it came

00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:38,989
you know with a manual for this it's the

00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:40,489
thing that I was trying to do so there

00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:42,379
was like times when things wouldn't work

00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:44,539
and then I was trying to figure out why

00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:46,070
that was and you know it's a sort of

00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:48,799
secret sort of hidden thing that if you

00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:50,929
do not send signals to the device at a

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,700
certain amount of time then the camera

00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:55,190
feed would shut off so at a certain

00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,019
point I was you know slowing down and

00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:58,399
then my camera would would just turn off

00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:59,599
and that's when I discovered that in

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,219
fact I could just turn off the camera

00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,849
and take still images and still be able

00:31:01,219 --> 00:31:06,709
to do this pretty good but that was you

00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:09,200
know that at a certain time that was

00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:10,879
like a you know a big problems like you

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,320
know cost me like a week or two weeks of

00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:13,940
trying to figure out you know what was

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,649
going on and they're all these little

00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,409
moving parts now I'm not saying that

00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:20,419
this is the best device for this I'm

00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:22,249
just saying it was cheap and I just

00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:23,479
chose it and you know said okay now I'm

00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:25,639
going to sit down and solve this problem

00:31:23,479 --> 00:31:27,499
I mean it just set some confined and

00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:30,259
just have some fun you know separate

00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:33,319
from my work and anything else that I do

00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:35,659
it what's that right yeah it's cool this

00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:36,740
all devices cool this one actually is a

00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:40,460
newer version of it

00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:42,320
it has a recorder in it that's right and

00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:44,300
it's problem mat if the tail will bend

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,150
back and pop pop up but it also causes

00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,590
friction so if you have if you've not

00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:51,200
moving fast enough like so you want to

00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:53,300
move slowly and you can kind of see here

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,980
I just kind of threw some tape down take

00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,450
us a little bit of a ridge if you're not

00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,429
moving fast enough and you won't be able

00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:00,410
to overcome the little Ridge

00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:03,230
now obviously why do you have ridges but

00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:11,770
you know it's yet another class of

00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:11,770
