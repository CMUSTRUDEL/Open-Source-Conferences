Description: 
	Even if you learned C in a classroom at some point, Perl's "XS" API for writing perl subs in something purported to be C but is really a cat on a tablet with caps lock on. In this talk I will show how difficult it is to write subs in plain C. This talk will make XS seem like a cakewalk.

Bulk88 has been working with Perl for 14 years. He is a frequent contributor to Perl 5 Porters, with a particular interest in optimization and Win32 support. While he loves Perl, he's also happy being close to bare metal, including both ARM and x86 assembly programming.
