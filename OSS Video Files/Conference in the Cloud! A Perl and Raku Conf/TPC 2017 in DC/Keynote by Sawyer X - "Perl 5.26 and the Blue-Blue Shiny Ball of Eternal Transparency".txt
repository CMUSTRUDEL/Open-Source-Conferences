Title: Keynote by Sawyer X - "Perl 5.26 and the Blue-Blue Shiny Ball of Eternal Transparency"
Publication date: 2017-06-21
Playlist: TPC 2017 in DC
Description: 
	By the time you sit down for this talk, Perl 5.26 has already been released onto an unsuspecting human world. This talk should - hopefully - cover enough of what Perl 5.26 has to offer you.

	00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,069
so yeah this is this is what happens

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,839
when someone suggests something on

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:11,429
Twitter you're like yeah sure I could do

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:16,109
that so yeah this is actually this is

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:21,300
because of Andrew and L a pro mongers

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:25,590
and zip recruiter so thank you somewhat

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,199
sarcastically but yeah they like it I'm

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,929
keeping it so it's fine

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:34,910
all right so should we start is there

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,910
anyone outside that's waiting to come in

00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:46,680
two minutes okay okay I am a joke it's

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:55,199
not seem tire joke

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:58,969
thank you I should wear it today you

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,969
never show up so when would you know

00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:10,140
yeah I didn't think I would have a lot

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,390
of opportunities to be at such a

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,140
prestigious place and wear something

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,170
that's silly

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:26,220
so like it all right okay

00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:27,570
so hi everyone employer I'm I'm the I'm

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,000
the pumpkin which is basically the

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,549
person in charge of kind of leading the

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,689
pro/5 project this is not my usual

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:43,259
attire thank you I wanted to talk about

00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:45,899
5:26 but first the title also as you can

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:50,220
see I'm actually very fast on making

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:53,130
decisions on either titles or tires so

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,630
the title actually comes from a TV show

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,509
that I like to trauma how many people

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,920
here like to trauma oh good everyone

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,020
knows the title right there's like a

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,540
species of cats in one of the episodes

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,549
that because they're so cute and lovely

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,729
they can control everyone which is

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:12,390
basically nowadays anyway

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,890
and they call earth blue blue shiny ball

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,040
and

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,290
I shouldn't come up with names with even

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:25,800
little daring me from the sideline so

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:29,130
okay so 526 p5p short for five Porter's

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,590
the group in charge of maintaining pro/5

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,650
and developing it we have a tradition of

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,630
noting any colleague any friend any

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,600
community member that have passed on

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,730
during the recycle the release cycle of

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,680
a version and before we begin I would

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,160
like to make note of that I feel because

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,440
this is a the 526 talk and 526 did come

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,120
out noting to community members that

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,769
have passed on I think it would be just

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,080
appropriate to also mention them in this

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:59,610
talk and that is yawning Kip who are not

00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:02,600
with us so thanks for that if you if you

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,430
know John if you knew John or Kip then

00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,590
do them and load their contributions for

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,080
the community and for anyone who need

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,380
them

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,209
okay so 526 the first question that I

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,800
had when I started working on this talk

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,750
is that there are a lot of people who

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,370
worked on 526 but everyone knows them

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,160
anything they would be really nice to

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:27,780
start with that who really made 526 and

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,640
for what it's worth I did very little so

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,380
there is this script called

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,660
acknowledgments that PL you can run from

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,690
the porting directory in the Perl 5

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,980
source code and the porting directory is

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,019
basically where we put a lot of our

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,120
utilities and the acknowledged one will

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,530
take two tags and will tell you all the

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,940
people that were involved with this also

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,410
how many files were changed and stuff

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,510
like that we actually use this

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,560
information when we make a release and

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,110
you have the information of what has

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,180
changed we use a lot of this data from

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,489
here these are the people that were

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,230
involved in releasing 526 all these

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,540
people these are not the only people

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,560
because a lot of people created tickets

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,910
reported issues documented things

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,310
commented on them and so on but these

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,280
are people who had acknowledged commits

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,989
that the script was able to identify the

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,280
following people I would like them to

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:18,209
please raise your hand

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,880
Abigail Jim Rick Stephen Chad Dave bulk

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:24,240
Nicola Doug David these are all people

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,440
here now from this list that with us not

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,100
everyone is but these people are

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:35,410
anything first of all thank you

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:38,620
okay if you see them around feel free to

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,390
say thank you high-five a hug whatever

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,630
everyone is comfortable with and buy

00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:49,300
them a beverage of your choice or just

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:50,710
just not okay so obviously what's going

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,510
on in this talk is that someone comes up

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,700
on stage and says okay let me tell you

00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,290
about everything that is in 5:26 and I

00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,360
was certainly think about this and the

00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,830
reason I thought about this is that this

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,780
is a common question that I get asked

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,810
now because 5:26 is the first version

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,300
stewarded by me and it is these are

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:10,200
really large shoes to fill even though

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm a larger shoe size and Rick and I

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,100
was thinking what is it that it will be

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,640
known for if you ask me what what is

00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,180
there

00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,130
I keep thinking ah well I don't know I

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,170
should know this so I started looking

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,000
previous versions to understand what's

00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,240
in those releases what are they known

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,150
for 520 introduced subroutine signatures

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,170
it was a big step they've changed sense

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,760
but it was a major step then you slice

00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,280
in tax I personally liked it very much

00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,110
postfix arrests that the more you you

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,900
use it the more you like it so the more

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,540
you're going to see it unicode 6.3 came

00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,030
out to prevent me from giving any

00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:54,040
additional talks on CGI p.m. it was

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:56,470
removed from core 522 added the bitwise

00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,970
operator very very few people use the

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,090
Double Diamond that I think even fewer

00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:03,160
use quick sidenote if every time you see

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,870
a diamond you change to the double

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,470
diamonds everything will be better so

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:11,680
just go ahead and do that we had a few

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:15,310
specific Unicode known spaces that we

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:19,000
added word boundaries specifically the

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:22,030
regex have now they now get the flash N

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,060
and those actually changed all of those

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:27,040
grouping in parentheses to not capture

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,720
so you don't have to have dollar one

00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,880
dollar two we just disabled that which

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,250
is pretty cool we have straight regular

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,440
expressions we have Unicode seven

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,850
now you could alias by reference if you

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,919
don't know what that is totally fine

00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,800
don't worry about it subroutines can now

00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:41,690
add the attributes

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,810
Const so these are really big things I

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:48,080
was 522 one of my third one is the multi

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,479
DRS up the basically takes access to a

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,770
hash or an array and then inside another

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,539
one in the inside or another one and

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,430
inside another one instead of multiple

00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,990
operations it creates one single

00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,080
operation in the upstream which makes it

00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,030
much much much much faster and I love

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,800
that and that was the work of Dave

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:09,470
Mitchell 5 2014 out and he had the post

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,629
text Europe post exterior finally in for

00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,900
good so that was great the audit DRS was

00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:16,879
removed the lexical topical variable was

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,650
removed Unicode 8 came out a new code 8

00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,560
to me was a big thing because they adds

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,310
a diversity system I will give a tip of

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,000
the hat to that later

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:28,699
some more word boundaries the context

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,610
stack rework that was another piece of

00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,229
work by Dave Mitchell that basically

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,509
restructured and rework the entire way

00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:37,099
to contact stack work which to most of

00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:43,699
us it means nothing other than hey

00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:45,860
subroutines are now 30% faster which is

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,900
not bad at all so Dave Mitchell did that

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,190
in deserve a lot of things unicode 8

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,569
specifically one of the things I liked

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,240
about is that it added a lot of these

00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:54,229
ideas if you take a look at this this is

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,569
an example something you could do with

00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:59,360
the Unicode that you could just take a

00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:01,279
heart and you can add a color variation

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,830
to it now it becomes a red heart you can

00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,080
take characters and you can use a 0 with

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,509
Joyner in order to create one single

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,639
character not a picture an actual

00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:12,919
character which is a combination of

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,930
multiple other characters which is

00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:17,659
really cool and one of them is even even

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,580
in a red color which is amazing so cool

00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:21,830
and you can create this image which I

00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,500
don't have this character supported on

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,240
Firefox because because probe can do

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,729
this but Firefox is not up to date

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,520
enough so I always like to say that my

00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:35,240
dead language is is more capable than my

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,800
super duper modern browser and chrome

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,890
didn't have that my term Hall didn't

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,279
have that so like for Liz to up to date

00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:45,680
this is a problem it also added the

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,449
diversity system that added skin tones

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,110
based on the Fitzpatrick scale that you

00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:52,960
can finally provide a representation of

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,090
people the way they really are

00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,560
none of us are yellow there is no single

00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,970
person in the world that is actually

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,010
yellow but now we can actually present

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,680
people with a different scale of real

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:05,620
colors used by the Fitzpatrick scale

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,880
which has its fault but it is probably

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,040
one of the more accurate ones that we

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,420
have I hope that the width will actually

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,570
match for the rest of my slides we'll

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,720
see so yes okay all of this happened

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:18,520
before 526 so I'm looking at that's it

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,870
like this is pretty cool what happened

00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:27,310
in 526 well not really sure so let me

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:33,970
try and cover that first the big stuff

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:35,560
okay we made the change with ink and we

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,300
need to talk about it it was a big

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:42,040
change and it's important to understand

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,100
basically we remove dot that is the

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,530
current directory and if previously my

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,360
computer had this as the directories of

00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,910
ink for those who are less familiar with

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,740
it ink is basically this array and when

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,360
Pearl wants to load a module it will go

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,100
through this array filled with

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,050
directories and look for that module in

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,790
one of those directories at the very end

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,110
is used to look for the current

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,670
directory so if you want to blow the

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,010
fubar it would go through all these

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,930
directories and try to find fubar in it

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,340
and if you couldn't find it it would say

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:12,370
well do we have in the current directory

00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,940
yes or no and if we did you're on it's

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:18,970
good except we removed it

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:21,400
which isn't work anymore for most cases

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,900
this is actually fine but there were a

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,450
lot of things that used it that we

00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,190
didn't know about that assumed that it

00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,540
would be there in the current directory

00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,600
and that it would have been fine but we

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:35,950
have to remove it due to security

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:37,780
constraints so most security problems

00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,700
are now really one single thing most

00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,560
security problems just like a lot of

00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,200
issues are a combination of multiple

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,610
small things they just happen to come up

00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,600
together if you are running code and

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,430
jumping to a directory and that

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,420
directory could be written by someone

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:58,000
else by itself it's fine but what if you

00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,280
want to lower the module and what if

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,750
your system your language automatically

00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,780
tries to load from anywhere including

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,810
wherever you are now which is now also

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,830
writable by someone

00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,990
that's a problem because you might load

00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:12,880
something they put in that just matches

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,550
the right path now you could say no

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,470
that's okay because if you notice we

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,390
have all these directories first so

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,120
you've probably loaded from there if it

00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:24,370
existed well what if it didn't exist oh

00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,590
well clearly it would fail well what if

00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:28,780
it's optional and you don't detect when

00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,280
it fails then you don't know then

00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,200
because sometimes exist so sometimes not

00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,540
existent to you it's the same so it

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,100
becomes like this perfect storm of all

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,550
these different things that come

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,010
together and suddenly uh and we're not

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:45,850
the first who removed dot from the

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:50,470
include directory path so there is some

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:51,040
form of prior art to this so what's

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,440
going on now

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,060
well Perl still works that's good and

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,650
Sipan is not on fire which is always

00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:01,210
good but there might be code that you

00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,010
use that you have written that your

00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,840
company uses it still depends on dot

00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,490
being an ink there might be a test fails

00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,320
maybe you're doing a build on your own

00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,630
manually and you realize wait a minute

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,340
where's dot so there are a few things

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,710
you could do in order to accommodate

00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,290
this and I would like to know that some

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:20,560
of it is very temporary so it's getting

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:23,050
in us you can have it to you fix it but

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,260
please do fix it because at some point

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,760
we will not allow that many workarounds

00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,340
to this because we want to kind of lock

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,690
this down we've always tried to allow as

00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,850
many things as possible but when

00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,170
security comes in it basically takes

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,970
over a lot of the conditions that we

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,280
have because we don't intend to be

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,340
insecure if you always want to be

00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,310
insecure you could do that yourself just

00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:48,030
fine but the language should provide you

00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:50,740
with a very good minimal set of security

00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:53,800
situations okay so first of all if you

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,720
are aware of dot because you change to

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,520
that directory yourself and you can

00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,620
control that you can just put dog back

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,000
in ink using push this is in a begin

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,190
block which means that it will happen

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,230
before any other use statement during

00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,030
compilation time so this is totally fine

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,510
just jump into that directory when you

00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:12,190
compile add dot to ink you're good

00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,260
another thing you could do is for a

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,420
particular call you can create a bear

00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,250
block and in that bear block you could

00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,300
localize Inc which means they soon as

00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,640
you exit the flow

00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,440
the block Inc is back to normal and then

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,750
once you localize Inc and say hey this

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,850
is Inc but with a dot at the end you

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,010
could then call whatever needs dot in

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,610
Inc and as soon as you exit that bear

00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,040
block

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,260
Inc is back to normal everything is fine

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,779
and low in read read config in this case

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,550
is an example of a function had dot in

00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:41,529
Inc when you needed it that's also a

00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:46,329
good thing but then please fix read

00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:48,220
config when you get the time you could

00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:49,570
also use this environment variable and

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,480
this environment variable basically

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:55,420
disable the safety it puts that back in

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,540
Inc this is what is used by the tool

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,610
chain in order to do the testing for

00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:05,440
modules that actually do need dot in Inc

00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:07,060
it sets this up and you can also

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,740
configure Perl yourself if you're a

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,300
vendor or if you want to compile it

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,430
yourself if you also do that an

00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:16,600
undefined that's what the U stands for

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:18,430
undef the protection for that but don't

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,750
do this and at some point we will remove

00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:24,160
this as well okay and I forgot there's

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,950
one more thing that always worked and

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,860
that's use Lib dot but take into account

00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,329
that actually put it at the beginning

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,160
which won't matter might not if you're

00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:37,899
running to do how many people here use

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,790
do the thing right and do actually uses

00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:42,310
Inc as well and a lot of us were not

00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:46,750
aware of it we thought do was basically

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:48,700
just a path well path but Inc so do uses

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,130
dot as well and because we removed it in

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,079
effect to do also if you want to have do

00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:58,020
and you want from current directory you

00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:58,020
can just add dot slash works just fine

00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:03,279
there's one more thing that we've added

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,990
and that is in the cases where we can

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,949
detect something that would have worked

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:11,290
and wouldn't now if you actually do have

00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,370
this situation recall do in some file

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,870
and you assume it's the current

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,420
directory everything will work and now

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,970
it doesn't and we knew that it would

00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,949
have worked then what happens that we

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:23,199
will still give you a warning by saying

00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:25,360
hey this failed it would have actually

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:29,020
worked you probably want to change it to

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:32,449
this instead which is very nice where's

00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,279
Matt is not here thought I saw on

00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:35,449
okay he deserves the thanks for

00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:38,679
basically saying hey could we add this

00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:40,939
it would be so so useful okay

00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:44,269
okay so let's move on we talked about

00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:45,470
Inc and that's half the talk now in that

00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:47,899
it's your dog so how many people know

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:50,709
what this is that's beautiful okay

00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:53,480
should I skip my entire example

00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,799
nevermind okay so I have this pattern

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,389
this is a pattern that I always have I

00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:57,559
really enjoyed I read a lot of command

00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,730
line applications and one of the things

00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,929
the first thing you should do in a

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,220
command line applications have a help

00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:04,339
even if it doesn't do anything other

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,899
than saying you can print help and with

00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,489
the way that I do help is that I'll have

00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:09,139
the same command premium to help but

00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:10,879
then I might send the parameter saying

00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:12,859
hey you also made this mistake so print

00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,049
the mistake and then print the help and

00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:16,879
it looks like this you get a message and

00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:18,259
this is a pattern that I have David

00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,699
Golding gave a talk where you mentioned

00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:22,160
that sometimes you could just reduce

00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:23,989
scope for unnecessary situations this is

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,879
a pattern that I have like the open or

00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:27,470
die I like this pattern and basically

00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:30,589
says if there is a message printed

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:33,589
otherwise we're good and then we start

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:35,839
this thing and I don't know who here has

00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:38,839
used tear ducts but if you have you've

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,059
done this where you wrote it and you put

00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,410
this and realize there's no work because

00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:43,669
now we have spaces now we have to move

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,019
it back to the side because it starts

00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,220
from the beginning of the line and then

00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,959
I'm going to put the Terminator but no

00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,119
way that won't work either so we have to

00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:52,089
put that over there as well and I have

00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:55,009
actually one seen code where the

00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:56,779
terminator which you can see right in

00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:59,539
you can't energy camp right next to the

00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:01,549
print there's the Terminator in the

00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:03,669
quote someone put in spaces so they

00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:07,959
could indent it has everyone done that

00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:11,600
all right to be fair I've done that you

00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:14,269
okay so now we have indented here Docs

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,220
and then the years I take this here doc

00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:18,409
character and say hey let's put it

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,269
killed here and by adding just this tilt

00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:26,409
to create this with carl williamson

00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:26,409
calls a here doc with a twist it

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,890
this one what it does is basically say

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,110
hey you know what you can indent this

00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,360
and when you indent this what happens is

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,460
that you can put determiner indented as

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,780
well and now using that Terminator it

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,160
looks at all of those spaces and says

00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,770
I'm just going to cut that amount of

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,040
space and if there's extra space like

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:48,410
the - H symbol there I will keep it I

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,210
will just cut down the same amount of

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:53,570
space from that line - so the dot H will

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:56,750
be indented - H I'm sorry the - H will

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:58,660
be indented but options and the dollar 0

00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,890
for the program name won't be intended

00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,510
someone asked me last time what happens

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,520
that there are fewer lines it will crook

00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,050
basically saying you can't do that

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,620
this feature by the way it's a very

00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:12,980
interesting thing Matthew horsfall who's

00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:16,400
not with us today this time he came on

00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:19,580
the mailing list and he said I've been

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:23,240
told this can't be done I've written it

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:27,650
can someone please check and people

00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,880
checked and relief yeah done so there

00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,500
are a lot of things that we don't try

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,120
because we're kind of worried and we're

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,730
not sure if it's possible but they are

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,450
actually fairly possible did you have a

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,450
question Chad

00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:53,970
I believe so

00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:56,670
okay so okay what else do we do we did

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,200
unicode nine you're gonna come down and

00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,730
support it actually came out a little

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,490
bit after five twenty four but we always

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,750
put it in when we are ready for it so

00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,490
that's five twenty six is already with

00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,740
unicode nine you reckon on everyone's

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,480
excited because it adds whiskey right

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,510
I don't drink I'm not excited about

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,060
whiskey it adds no interest or joy in my

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:18,930
life however what is almost a religious

00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:20,880
experience for me is avvocato I am well

00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:23,970
dressed today but I do have with me my

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,520
avocado shirt now what I like is that

00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:29,220
for what I believe is the first time

00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,980
ever the Unicode consortium has added

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:36,060
another character another emoji just to

00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:40,050
be able to respond to people who react

00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:43,110
to you on how you present a different

00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:45,600
character from the same standard what I

00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:49,500
mean is if I'm excited about avocados

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,260
and someone goes avocados then finally

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,730
they also added with this Unicode a way

00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:58,530
for me to respond to that which is the

00:19:53,730 --> 00:20:03,900
facepalm thank you another avocados

00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:04,860
aficionado so so yeah and if you are on

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,290
social networks

00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:10,560
this probably describes as how some of

00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:12,330
your day is like sometimes now other

00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,490
than those obviously unicode nine

00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:16,050
actually adds real things as well now

00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,390
just care right now just these nice

00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:20,160
symbols but these are languages these

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,470
are languages that people who speak them

00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,390
are not now able to natively express

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,920
themselves which is very very important

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,340
the last one is an example of the

00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,020
language

00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,000
sure it's historic but that means you

00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,740
could research it better which is very

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,930
important because we research languages

00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,060
as well so there is actually ad very

00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:38,010
important value and what we like sending

00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,260
all these texts this is another thing

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:42,270
that Unicode does which in some cases is

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,040
far more important and we we kind of

00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,860
rely on speakers it doesn't matter yeah

00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:49,860
but someone does so yeah except the last

00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:55,200
one but someone studies it

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:58,530
funny story I worked at a company a long

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:03,090
long time ago and the developers used

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:05,910
the R&D department used PHP and which is

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,790
not relevant to the story and I remember

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,929
they would ask us the SIS admin's

00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:12,150
because that's what I used to do there

00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:13,920
for help once in a while on things that

00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,900
I didn't understand in their own code or

00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,130
in the process or in the servers and

00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,929
whatever and I remember one time they

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,549
wanted to some help debugging something

00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:23,370
that appears on the production website

00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:25,860
so open up the website and what I see is

00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:27,630
a character of greater than and

00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,370
underneath that there was another

00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,480
greater than and underneath that there

00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,929
was another greater than that and the

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,600
entire website was scrunched down so I

00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:38,669
click view source and lo and behold

00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,710
there were a lot of greater than and

00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:42,870
then a bunch of text and then a lot of

00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:46,710
equals and then a bunch of text and a

00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:48,540
lot of less than effectively what

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,840
happens that someone developed a feature

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,700
on a different branch and a lot of time

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,179
at paths and then decided to just merge

00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,679
it it conflicted everywhere so the

00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,840
started reviewing it was over a hundred

00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:04,490
files and at some point they said ah and

00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,490
it just merged it

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:12,760
and then deployed it okay so imagine

00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:16,690
this code very relevant to the current

00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,700
state of view so this is an example of

00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:22,720
the conflict between two different

00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:26,190
versions and if you run it now in Pearl

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,190
does anyone know what will happen

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:39,880
Randall here Zacks very good how many of

00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:43,330
your Docs does it identify okay this is

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,460
the output it says use a bear twice and

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,870
then it says I just can't find a string

00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,080
parameter for this but until then

00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:56,740
totally fine but now if you run it on

00:22:50,080 --> 00:23:00,960
526 this wait yes wait

00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,960
Abigail you can't we talked about this

00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:12,070
this is on 524 if you run in on 526 it

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,590
says this which is hey I discovered

00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,540
three version control conflict markers

00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,400
you don't see them I'm sorry oh you do

00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:21,220
see them a little bit so what you see is

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,990
the less than the equal the greater than

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:28,210
and on newer versions if we actually try

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:30,010
527 which reads currently bleed then you

00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:33,250
will also tell you that that thing will

00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:35,440
be like an empty bear here doc

00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,880
terminator will be removed most of us

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,560
know what it is but then you saw Abigail

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,220
talks you know you know it's great you

00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,400
haven't used it and now we also removed

00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,890
okay

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,510
capture data variables this this K mean

00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,460
actually just a little bit before we

00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:51,190
were ready for the the freeze entirely

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:53,200
and if orden came in and said ah this is

00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,310
kind of cool put it in which was really

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,620
awesome because let me show you what it

00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:58,720
is this is another pattern I have I will

00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,400
use some regular expression and do some

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,410
captures those are the apprentices that

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,350
you see and I will capture three things

00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:08,020
they won't always be a B and C but you

00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:09,640
know and then I will have to copy them

00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,670
over to other variables now you can of

00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,250
course name them but this is a more

00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,970
common pattern that I have and this is

00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,010
very frustrating

00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:20,050
until you realize wait a minute I can do

00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,880
this all together because pro allows to

00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,890
do a lot of things together this is much

00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,650
simpler and then you have to check that

00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:28,720
you received all three right so you go

00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:30,430
if I have if I don't have the first one

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,260
or I don't have the second one or a

00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:34,240
different way that I do this is this one

00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:39,840
if I have the first one and the second

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,840
one and the third one or I just don't

00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,490
it's very frustrating but what happens

00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,170
if there's one of them is optional so

00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,260
the see the last one now there's a

00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:52,540
question mark that says well maybe not

00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:55,360
well now we have to have default we need

00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:57,820
to check so frustrating and it happens

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,770
to me all the time so now with the new

00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,440
capture variables you can just use that

00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:04,870
instead as an array which will contain

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,900
all of the captured variables you know

00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:10,540
need to know if there was a dollar for

00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,770
just go to this array it's fantastic you

00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:17,760
can also use it just like any other

00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:21,700
array it's great if using a hash plus or

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:25,870
hash - you now have compatible variables

00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:28,510
for that which is the hash Pat capture

00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:30,790
and hash hat capture all and if you

00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:34,260
don't use them that's also fine I don't

00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:37,710
think I've ever used them the double X

00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:40,330
double X comes from our idea of having

00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,950
much more readability in regular

00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,870
expression it's really funny for a

00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:47,710
language that everyone accuses of being

00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:49,810
read write only and not read it actually

00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,960
has a lot of facilities for readability

00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:55,720
that other languages had to take as well

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,790
because they were so good one of those

00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,050
ideas is the X that some languages don't

00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:01,540
even support it yet you have to just

00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,770
have a string but we have X and now we

00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,720
have double X so let's start with X

00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:07,600
first you have this regular expression

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,090
and you say oh this is really condensed

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:15,430
this is also really condensed I shall

00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:17,910
put an X and I will have spacing the

00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,910
problem

00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:25,270
the problem is that this is a character

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:27,970
class right there which basically means

00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:30,040
one of these and when it's one of these

00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:33,100
and you put a space you will say one of

00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,600
these including for example a space so

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,550
you can't put a space because it thinks

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,560
it's a literal space so you can only

00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,390
expand before and after but now we have

00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,940
double X and double X says no no no I

00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,200
want to expand even further and the

00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,480
really nice thing is you can see that

00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:51,340
this might have been confused to say de

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:58,240
GI 3 or 7 it might seem like that but it

00:26:51,340 --> 00:27:00,370
is actually D to e G to I 3 to 7 and now

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,800
it's much clearer and this actually

00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:05,350
matters and the next one also seems much

00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,470
clearer as well so this is the double X

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:10,120
very nice I like that very much

00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,460
script extensions is another thing that

00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,590
we've added script extensions make quite

00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,990
a few things more accurate when it comes

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:19,000
to a particular screen script in Unicode

00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:20,440
most of us don't know what it is if you

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,420
do know what it is you say oh but what

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,370
if I had something very particular there

00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:27,970
was more accurate than their script that

00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,570
is also supported for most of us no idea

00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:31,360
what this means

00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:34,030
but it's documented so we can read about

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,890
it if we're interested so Perl Unicode

00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,450
has a part called script and if you're

00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:40,150
interested in what what is really main

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:43,240
script script extensions you could read

00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:46,180
about there you might have seen an error

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,660
called escape unscathed left brace in

00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,450
regex

00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:51,760
and at first I was like ah I can just

00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:53,020
mention it but now I realized we see

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,310
this but we don't know what it means and

00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:59,200
I think it would be important to explain

00:27:54,310 --> 00:28:02,740
see all these lines have these left

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,990
brace characters in there and in all of

00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,700
these lines we mean a literal one which

00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:10,930
basically means no seriously that

00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,880
specific character even the backslash D

00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,650
that means digit and then we know that

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,480
it means a quantity because there's

00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:18,940
nothing in there we actually mean no

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,860
just a digit and then two braces which

00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,360
is very confusing and we actually want

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,810
to use the curly for more stuff because

00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:28,710
like you know curly doesn't serve enough

00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,710
purposes in problems so

00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:37,120
yeah so yeah also dollars so so now it

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:38,710
will give you a warning and you'll say

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,180
hey no you're gonna you're going to have

00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:42,250
to really if you want this character

00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,870
please escape it put a slice there of

00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:46,600
access there so we know that you want

00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:48,310
the character versus then versus

00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,790
something that we use this character to

00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:54,340
mean so take also into account that in

00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:56,320
five thirty this walls will be failed so

00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:59,590
the only way to do this is the super

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,350
complicated put a backslash before that

00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:04,450
also the backslash Q in the backslash e

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,400
for quoting and encoding will work as

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,020
well

00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,190
so that's all you got to do and of

00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,500
course on the right there that's that's

00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:14,170
a right brace but when you write braces

00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:22,660
literally you often do both parts there

00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:25,360
are two specific apartment so at this

00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:28,420
point I'm not sure if all cases will be

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,280
caught and warned about but I think it

00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,840
would be good practice moving forward to

00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,180
just escape when you see curly braces

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,040
when you want them as literals and that

00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:38,700
would be a way for you to preempt any

00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,310
possible change in the future

00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,380
does that help

00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:46,420
so there are two specific cases that are

00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,710
allowed exceptions we will allow we

00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,140
allow them now we will allow them in the

00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:52,090
future and these are when you have a

00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,830
left brace at the beginning and that

00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,390
happens in two cases first at the

00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,730
beginning obviously right over here and

00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,590
also when you have a group and you want

00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,780
to do an or condition and then the one

00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,160
of those clauses has a beginning that's

00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,010
also what's happening in the second line

00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:09,840
and that's also allowed but please I

00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:09,840
recommend not doing it yes

00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,940
we then character class actually I'm not

00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:21,310
sure I think it is a literal it is a

00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:23,620
literal yes sorry so um yeah if you're

00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:25,270
not sure and you're like I remember

00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,840
what's allowing let's not just escape it

00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:29,920
you're good just dis escape it it's fine

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,520
okay so there are references to

00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,780
variables now we have ref aliasing in

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,060
previous versions but we've added the

00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:39,190
declared refs previously you could do

00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,840
this in order to create an alias now you

00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:43,330
could actually use the reference

00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,789
directly and the entire change here is

00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:48,909
the ability not the switch but the

00:30:45,789 --> 00:30:51,009
ability to move the backslash before

00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:55,470
food that's it that's the entire thing

00:30:51,009 --> 00:31:00,669
and some people Rick will love this

00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:03,460
thank you Rick okay one more thing um so

00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:05,200
yeah there's a pattern that we sometimes

00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,899
do and when I say we sometimes do I mean

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,700
I do quite frequently which is to use a

00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,779
hash I want to get the keys from it or I

00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,100
want to get something else from it and

00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:13,539
actually just use the hash instead by

00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,749
accident how many times have you written

00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:19,419
my food equals hash directly so this

00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:23,499
puts the hash in scalar context now this

00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:26,740
is a short quiz I have prepared ahead of

00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:30,549
time a hash and the hash has how many

00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:33,549
elements trick question we do not really

00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:37,330
explain what elements are next try how

00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:38,710
many sorry how many keys 150 use it

00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:43,869
better than I but I'm Dyslexic I'm

00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:46,919
allowed values 150 right good what will

00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:48,999
foo be if I print it

00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:53,200
Randall is not allowed to answer now

00:31:48,999 --> 00:31:54,279
what will where is Damien here is Larry

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,350
also I'm sorry

00:31:54,279 --> 00:32:00,360
lovey to death you are not allowed to

00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:03,700
participate someone hold them down it

00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:06,789
okay let's do this let's do this how

00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:10,269
many people say it will be 300 which is

00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:11,259
both the keys and the values raise your

00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:13,210
hand okay cool

00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:16,629
how many people say it will be just a

00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:18,669
number of keys that's 150 right just

00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:21,429
number of keys okay any other

00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:24,149
suggestions interesting ideas then I'm

00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:24,149
the letter K

00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:34,179
Rick I would love to accept your answer

00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:37,690
but that is not a number nine

00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:41,770
very good I tried this I got 118 over

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:44,380
256 so very few people Rick know what

00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:45,760
this means and it actually has

00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,190
information about the bucketing down

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,200
inside and assumes the answer 518 with

00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:51,700
hash randomization this becomes an

00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,140
entirely different thing which means

00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,760
that if I can I can run it again and

00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,740
again it might print out different stuff

00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,650
for process runs so this becomes very

00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:01,840
complicated it is almost I'm sorry it is

00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,980
always a mistake to do this because very

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,419
few people understand what this means

00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:07,299
and if you do understand what this means

00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:08,740
it doesn't help you at all there is not

00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:10,169
a single thing you could do with this

00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:14,289
information

00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:18,370
nothing so we fix that and you will now

00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:20,200
just return sorry confusing during

00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:23,789
developers know we are actually working

00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,380
on a set of new things to confuse early

00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:28,809
adopters so it will now print the number

00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:33,720
of keys which is also like way faster

00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:33,720
and you could use it thank you

00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:42,220
see Larry trolls like a boss okay all

00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,980
right so we fixed a few things while

00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,140
we're at it I'd like to note a few we

00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,480
said farewell to Usenet in all the

00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,900
documentation the temp name in POSIX

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,460
removed gone encoding very few people

00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,650
use it and if you want to use it I

00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,970
suggest you don't but if you still want

00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,950
to use it you can get it in filter

00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:04,000
encoding or encoding PM has it and then

00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:05,830
you could also just not do it you used

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,270
to be able to use double : the beginning

00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:13,089
of a requires you can't anymore this was

00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:16,290
actually a syntax change that we

00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:19,780
accidentally made and we broke stuff see

00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:23,020
when you do in quotes foo colon colon

00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:25,149
bar up until 518 what it meant is I have

00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:28,300
a variable foo colon colon and I would

00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:32,710
like to concatenate it $2 bar they'll

00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:35,020
say yeah now in 518 this change to say I

00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,940
have a variable dollar foo I would like

00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,320
to concatenate it to colon colon and

00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,300
then I would like to concatenate it to

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,869
bar so we fixed that

00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:46,070
it was broken from 5:18 till now so

00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:49,250
apparently not that many people notice

00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:54,050
and one of the more important ones if

00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:57,500
you have a tight glove with six that six

00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:59,450
consecutive colons it now works again I

00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,660
don't know if it worked before but it

00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:04,760
now works at least so very very crucial

00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,950
okay some optimizations we've done

00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,960
seventeen signatures were a really nice

00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,450
thing it was a good idea we played with

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,340
that but now there as fast as not using

00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,630
them so they're comparable in speed so

00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:17,119
you can just use them directly don't

00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:22,030
worry there is no degradation and we do

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:24,200
have some plans for more thank you I

00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:26,570
didn't do the work but thank you okay

00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,599
this is also Dave Mitchell a lot of our

00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:32,810
optimizations are done by Dave Mitchell

00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:34,730
now if you're using 64-bit it is the

00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,230
default in most of our environments the

00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:39,230
hashing function is now faster which is

00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:42,560
important read line is faster if you do

00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:45,020
assignments and on the left side the LHS

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,390
stands for less left-hand side basically

00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,760
means on the left side there is an array

00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:52,250
or a hash at the end it will be faster

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,930
considerably faster also if you have any

00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,190
string that you convert to a number into

00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:58,099
single digit that will also be

00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:00,640
considerably faster bear word constant

00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:04,690
strings are now constant folded as well

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:08,089
so we're trying to summarize 526 and

00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:12,530
this is mostly a note to self so someone

00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:15,470
asked me I can use this first 526 gave

00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:17,599
us and is giving us a safer ink it gives

00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:20,570
us Unicode 9 in that the tear ducts

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:23,599
captured data variables version control

00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:25,430
marker recognition the double X Unicode

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,950
Script extensions by default which means

00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:34,280
more accurate scripts in Unicode that

00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:36,430
subroutine signatures not no degradation

00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,260
in speeds compared to not using them and

00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:43,010
several other optimizations and a bunch

00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:47,030
of fixes so it's pretty good right now a

00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:49,369
few notes moving forward we've had a

00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,650
hackathon last year the first time Taj

00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:53,330
Mahal and I organized a core hackathon

00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,960
it was modeled after the toolchain

00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,520
hackathon

00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,990
which is kind of different from other

00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,550
hackathons it's not basically a

00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:01,580
free-for-all it's more like we are

00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:04,400
trying to handle specific tasks so we

00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:06,410
gear specifically towards them and we

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,900
come in we work on them and write a

00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:10,849
report at the end and it has its merits

00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:13,250
which is why it has always been

00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:14,990
successful and we try to do that with a

00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,640
core we accomplished a bunch of stuff

00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:19,130
there's a blog post I really recommend

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,480
reading about this and we've got some

00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:22,730
really good sponsorship who's under the

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,800
TPF so it was an official profound Asian

00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:26,570
conference which was excellent I like to

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,230
thank the pro foundation for helping us

00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:32,930
with this it was fantastic and we intend

00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:34,760
to have another one in October so you

00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:36,080
should wait for another report of what

00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,670
we could do and if you have ideas of

00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,050
stuff you think we should be working

00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:42,589
really hard during the hackathon because

00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:44,030
we get all these crazy people into one

00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:45,920
room and we can talk and work together

00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,869
in stuffs is fantastic so you have an

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,770
idea for all of us to work on feel free

00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:53,540
to share now 527 is the current

00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:57,500
development release we're working on

00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:59,480
that we released 527 zero and there's

00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,040
another one coming up soon which I'll

00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,420
share in a bit but I want to tell you

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,119
what's already in it because I got

00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:07,640
what's in it it's been at least a month

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,080
and a half but we did those things

00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,900
already in a month and a half so first

00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,700
we now can do delete on key value

00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,130
splices I use places all the time this

00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:19,280
is really nice if you're using formats

00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:22,490
how many people here use format tux is

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,570
not here and he's probably one of the

00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:27,200
few people I know they actually use

00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:29,800
formats but if you do you cannot use a

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:35,619
comma list variable list anymore

00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:39,109
it was deprecated since version 5 gone

00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:41,930
we're done we have a specific apology

00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:43,310
directly to tux okay logged in unique

00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:46,339
that was also mentioned by Abigail

00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:49,820
earlier it is gone by the way since 512

00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:52,940
is did nothing so you wrote it you're

00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:55,460
like awesome did nothing ignored no one

00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:57,470
if you're using backslash N and there's

00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:00,290
empty phrases in there is now illegal

00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:02,690
because it doesn't do anything this one

00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:05,330
Abigail mentions well this was an

00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,770
example of something that is a very

00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:08,120
controversial issue for it not

00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:10,130
particularly this one

00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,360
it just represents an issue this by the

00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,500
way I remember seeing that's the first

00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,300
time I remember when I don't even know

00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,740
what that was but basically it means

00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,360
that you have a here dog

00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,040
Abigail give an example of this if you

00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,180
don't remember it's you have in here dog

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,870
and then you're supposed to put a

00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:25,910
terminator so you put like end or you

00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:28,880
know not underscores and underscores but

00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:30,830
something else and you can also put in

00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,780
like just empty you could do that you

00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:34,310
can put like quotes in quotes or two

00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:36,260
single quotes and that will work with

00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:38,750
basic means if I see one empty line

00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:40,280
that's the end of that that is also fine

00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,560
the only thing that is not fine is not

00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,750
doing anything just wondering semicolon

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,870
like that's it and that actually worked

00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:50,270
and that was what's called this thing

00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:53,020
that's the bear one to bear your dog

00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:55,880
Terminator I have never once seen it and

00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:58,970
we had an issue where we wanted to add

00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,890
the inductance here dogs and this is one

00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:02,630
example of the complications of software

00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,550
at a large scale like things like Perl

00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,160
which is used everywhere 2bic with this

00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:09,680
and what happens is that we wanted to

00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,210
put the printing in sort of a till we

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,340
want to put a dash and confuse this

00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:15,050
mechanism somehow so we're like okay now

00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,520
it's in the way so this is the right

00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:18,500
time to deprecated something and remove

00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,580
it because the policy is if it if it

00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,040
doesn't break anything

00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,810
don't break it which is a sensible

00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,910
policy you know it's not in your way

00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,680
don't touch it if it's in your way you

00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,810
can't do something then you can do that

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,330
and we said okay then I guess it's time

00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:34,310
to remove it but now we need to releases

00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:36,890
to warn you about it so you can remove

00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:39,260
it from your code which is also a very

00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:41,300
good policy to have if I'm going to

00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:45,590
remove something you have at least two

00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:47,150
stable versions to fix your code but now

00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:49,250
we're in the situation where we want to

00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:52,400
have a change that takes two releases

00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:54,950
and at the third one we actually want to

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,780
introduce something I want to do now so

00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:58,700
the mess so we change the child and then

00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,830
we said okay then can we remove it now

00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,930
and I was like well it's not in the way

00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:06,710
anymore

00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:08,390
right so this becomes this becomes a

00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:12,260
thorn that happens in development

00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:14,240
sometimes and we're removing it this by

00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,830
the way important to know Abigail

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,530
mentioned this but I do want to mention

00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:21,980
it again not 5 point something 5.000

00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:27,260
deprecated it in

00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:28,490
1996 by by the way Larry who made a

00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,609
comment that basically said okay

00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:33,410
deprecated warrant that's it which was

00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:34,790
good except we didn't follow up and then

00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,130
we are in turn around whether we should

00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:38,570
follow up and we decided we do follow up

00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,160
thanks by the way too

00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:42,590
Abigail's work during the court

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,320
hackathon we decided that every single

00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:47,270
deprecation now has a version and you

00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,100
know when it's removed which is very

00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,810
crucial thank you by the way Abigail

00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,369
because he pushed that idea and make

00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:58,700
sure that we cover every single

00:41:52,369 --> 00:42:11,810
deprecation all right if use hashes and

00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:13,490
your key is over two gigs yes so first

00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:17,450
Dave you would be surprised to know it

00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:19,910
was never actually supported but now you

00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:21,740
also know that it wasn't supported which

00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:24,830
is important okay if you have a quote

00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,869
points that go above this value it won't

00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,430
work but now we also tell you about this

00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:30,380
and this by the way you broke two

00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:32,030
modules they just come from the same one

00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,410
so one came from the other but it

00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:35,330
already broke something so we already

00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:37,340
see that someone accidently did that so

00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:40,609
or a purpose I don't know but this is

00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,530
another thing that we're changing this

00:42:40,609 --> 00:42:46,400
is not in yet and I'm kind of giving you

00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:48,380
a kind of like a heads up we want to

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,869
make signatures fast we don't want to

00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:53,060
make them as fast we've done that what

00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:54,800
we want to do is make them faster I want

00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:57,260
to give you one more reason to use

00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:01,220
signatures other than do it like it's so

00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:05,300
much better now you could say it's also

00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:08,690
faster I have to use it so we have some

00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,790
plans to do this hopefully 528 I can't

00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:14,630
promise this will likely also be David

00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:16,190
Mitchell and we've also added Travis CI

00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,990
so now we have Travis CI for all and

00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,730
this took a while because it was kind of

00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:22,330
awkward and a lot of people helped with

00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,560
that so thank you very much

00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:27,650
527 I mentioned that we had five point

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,990
seven zero and tomorrow there was

00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:32,570
another version five point seven one

00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:34,460
it's released by Eric Herman he already

00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:35,150
prepared everything tomorrow he just

00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:38,660
presses the button

00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:39,980
so it's pretty cool now you might be

00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,140
looking at this and saying hey this is

00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:44,750
kind of nice I would love to say thank

00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,250
you not to me you want to say thank you

00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:50,270
to the people who did the work I didn't

00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:51,290
do anything but if you want to do this

00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,640
and they're down at the conference

00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,110
there's this really cool thing you can

00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,450
do it comes with parole you can just run

00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:58,430
a command called pearl thanks and then

00:43:56,450 --> 00:44:00,020
it opens up an editor you can argue over

00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:03,590
which editor is best later because it

00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:07,250
will open your configured one and who

00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:08,840
uses is here I do why are you so you run

00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,100
pearl things you get an editor you put

00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,720
in a message of like hey thank you I

00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,820
really appreciate all the work that you

00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,470
did and I enjoy this very much and it

00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,210
will send an email that will reach the

00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:20,600
main language for pro/5 borders it is

00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:23,120
public and we all monitor it and read it

00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,760
all the time and it is very heartwarming

00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,740
to get someone who uses it to say hey I

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,510
use this and I really appreciate the

00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,650
work you did on this it's great so if

00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,870
you want to do this you could do that

00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:37,120
now I have seven minutes left and it's

00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:41,990
exactly the right time to get to my talk

00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:43,610
my talk is titled you and pearl how many

00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:45,140
people here and if you don't feel

00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,280
comfortable that's also fine but I would

00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:49,880
love a show of hands how many people

00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:53,390
here know see to some degree that's

00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:55,100
fairly a lot I'm bad what about C++ okay

00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:58,520
Wow tastic

00:44:55,100 --> 00:45:00,110
what about Perl Wow

00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,580
I assume some people are raising two

00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:06,110
hands Larry right to pearls so still

00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,640
working on it

00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:10,850
when you say I write Perl you mean the

00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:17,420
language not even okay so I don't have

00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:20,210
them in jokes but so so yeah and has

00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:21,980
anyone here a written test fix tests

00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:24,020
something like that okay great how many

00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:27,760
people here with the last row of mint I

00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:32,240
promise have either written or read

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:36,020
documentation okay very good very good

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,850
so we have all of this in core right we

00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:39,890
have some C code if you don't suppose it

00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:41,990
helps though we're not C plus if you

00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:44,360
know Perl it helps if you have written

00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:46,100
tests if you have set tests if you've

00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,570
written documentation if you've read it

00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,920
and you know what you don't like reading

00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,990
all these things

00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,970
we have and we have a need for help with

00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:54,950
those so for interested in saying hey

00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:57,410
actually I want to contribute to the

00:45:54,950 --> 00:46:00,950
language itself as well then I will

00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:02,450
suggest coming over and helping us out

00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:04,100
because there are a lot of stuff to do

00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:05,630
some of the stuff that we need is even

00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,520
just tracking everything that needs to

00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:10,370
be done so far it's done by Jim by the

00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:13,310
way Jim Keenan and he does amazing

00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:17,030
amazing work with us but it's not easy

00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:19,340
and we need help with basically

00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:21,440
everything if you're interested there is

00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,390
a mailing list for it and the mailer

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,510
list is for flight porters you can join

00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:28,850
there's a strict standard of behavior

00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:31,480
generative conduct that we adhere to

00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:33,230
which basically is don't be a jerk and

00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,970
we stand by it

00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,200
we're very serious in order to make sure

00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:38,300
that we have an environment that we all

00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,370
feel comfortable talking in and sharing

00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:43,070
and working together without anyone

00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:45,410
trying to take the stage I shouldn't be

00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:50,780
saying this because I'm on stage but you

00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:52,730
know what I mean and taking over or not

00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,590
leaving your room to be there so it's

00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:56,540
very important and we stand by that and

00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:58,520
we would love for you to join us and

00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:02,420
make it even more of that kind of place

00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:04,330
with even more work on it if you don't

00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:07,250
want to read it because it's actually

00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:09,350
it's it's there's quite a little bit of

00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,730
traffic in there you can also just read

00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:12,500
the summaries I try to summarize it

00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,700
every week usually comes on on Monday

00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,560
this time will probably come out

00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:18,020
tomorrow if I finish because I want to

00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,100
include the new release and you can read

00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,690
the summaries themselves they are

00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,190
published on the blip there are several

00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:23,960
people who are registered list and do

00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:25,370
not read it just because it's a lot but

00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,410
if there's something there they want to

00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:29,000
comment on they will and instead they

00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:30,500
read the summaries emails on this list

00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,600
but you can also read the summaries on

00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:34,520
the blog that I maintain or on the

00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,230
Twitter account or on a specific mailing

00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,060
list just for summaries which is four

00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,950
o'clock summer some of the behavior that

00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:43,430
we encourage and would like to maintain

00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:45,890
I suggested as a general thing diversity

00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:47,120
and inclusivity is crucial these are

00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:50,000
different things but they're both very

00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:54,550
important be welcoming be friendly and

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:57,020
be cooperative because one single person

00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:58,340
cannot do this or at least can do this

00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,910
properly but a lot of people can do

00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:02,770
amazing work and some people don't

00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:04,420
actually understand

00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:06,700
why it is valuable to have more than

00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:08,740
just you or more than just you and a few

00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,940
friends in this matters so I kind of

00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:11,950
want to iterate a little bit about this

00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,540
from a technical perspective having more

00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:15,040
people means you have more eyes and a

00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,840
problem you have more hands helping with

00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,250
it it means you have different skills

00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,960
different abilities because we're all

00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,180
different and it is good to have all of

00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,800
these skills and abilities the code is

00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:26,080
better because it adheres to more things

00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,600
more ideas the documentation is better

00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,450
because it speaks to more people and the

00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:34,030
testing is better because it covers more

00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:35,380
situations more platforms and the

00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:37,570
commuter gets bigger which is what we

00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,400
want what I really want my goal from

00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:40,750
this talk is that next year when I

00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,130
present what we did and I show you all

00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:45,340
the people involved it includes all of

00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:47,530
you and I hope to see that so some

00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,810
quotes to end it the best way to predict

00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:51,730
the future is to create it another one

00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:54,070
that I like I could not find who said it

00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:56,260
but I assumed someone said it's someone

00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:57,700
else somewhere to make each other proud

00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:00,640
I think we should make each other proud

00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:02,020
I'd like to quote an American president

00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,580
because we're in the right place not

00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:07,770
this American president but a different

00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:07,770
one who said be excellent to each other

00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:16,450
he said it by an actor at a film and it

00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:18,550
was in him but it still count because

00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:21,940
the story the the spirit behind it is

00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:24,810
what matters and really that's about it

00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,810
thank you very much

00:49:30,769 --> 00:49:40,160
