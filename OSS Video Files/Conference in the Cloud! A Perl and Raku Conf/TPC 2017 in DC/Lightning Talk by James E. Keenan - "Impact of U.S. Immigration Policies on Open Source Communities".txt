allows Mediacom laughs okay so meeting

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,750
zakappa so if you don't get a blog

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,580
aggregator and one of its features is

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,520
that it permits people to set up

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,820
basically South website for which they

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,900
function I would say as Megazine editors

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,390
and one of the sites that I needed that

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,429
town is called cultured pearl calm

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,050
identified a fraud very eminent

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:36,510
programmer in London England and he has

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,010
the website called cultured pearls and I

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,899
like to bring to cultured pearl and

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,360
equal a to a pearl gets the Nexus

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,750
possessed of the world so I business

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,079
humble articles on cultured pearl i I

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,879
went to my meeting of that time and I

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,379
asked age I wasn't uncomfortable like

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,809
I'm an aggregate at that important

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,730
everything he does so so the first which

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,489
was last September pearl of the art art

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,770
in the time of the story tomorrow it was

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,500
an interview with two women who work at

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,409
the Getty Art Museum in Los Angeles

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,799
California who did tremendous amounts of

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,500
research on the artwork looted by the

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,430
Nazis from Jews and other people during

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:22,170
the 1930s and 1940s and how they ended

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:25,290
up a database of our catalog from 1930

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,759
to help record and how they use pearl in

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,490
their lair

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,009
The Guardian icon website released CSV

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,869
files dragging the past the incidents of

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,720
gun violence in cities and each in the

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,900
United States and I said here did you

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,509
know go visit it and it turns out that

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,689
the data was journey from intensively at

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,000
you and I analyzed them with pearl with

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,900
pearl and an article there

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,960
but subject today is well we go get

00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,330
couple weeks to The New Yorker louder

00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,150
speeding which took place according to

00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,150
the peculiar pub and I oft I was

00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,680
wondering who was going to be coming to

00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,110
TBC and I added the conversation with

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,040
David Aylor I think you know in the

00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:12,560
current tone of the United States with

00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:15,110
respect to people from other countries I

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,940
would not be surprised at all if there

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,090
were people who normally would be coming

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,970
to be GGC and when I'm going to do so

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:25,250
this year and he said yeah I know three

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:28,250
people already with attended to the past

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,140
for an upcoming year now since my

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,590
information secondhand I'm not going to

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:37,100
use their name but I am going to say

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,590
that I believe that US immigration and

00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:43,100
border policies are going to have very

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,010
negative effect on open source software

00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,180
commuters

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,130
time is gluttonous I'm not going to

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,660
billeted it for detail I'm happy to

00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,670
discuss with the policy are too sweet

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,310
because they changed her briefly and

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,290
it's force it is arbitrary I'm not going

00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,390
to blame the pub administration

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,610
exclusively on this because under Obama

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,700
the room Banyon cies of Border Patrol

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,910
people harassing people at the border

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,680
were US citizens whose names were Arabic

00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:13,070
or whose of you know religious

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,670
background was a was Muslim and of

00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,840
course the energy allows it is deported

00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,959
more people than any other

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,720
administration history and I'm not even

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:28,100
willing to argue here that the Trump

00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,900
administration policies are have the

00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,540
APOBEC in general and Islamic and

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,579
procedure

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,390
I'm going to state it as a pad and if

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,390
you want to argue with it

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,349
what I listed here is that I believe

00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:44,129
that open so when you do the a card

00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:46,640
scientific community and the the having

00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:48,989
a scientific community our premise on

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,349
communication and cooperation across

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:55,019
borders and there's a Shalini you're

00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:58,200
talking to somebody in Syria on IRC

00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:01,560
noise I mean you're filing a polka class

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,250
for somebody somebody who is living in

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,980
France

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:09,510
it means you need to be able to contact

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:12,299
people face to face and there are arms

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,189
coming from the current policies for one

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,780
thing they're open-source contributors

00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:20,190
who come from the ends of countries and

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,199
there are other people probably many

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,360
more other people for his courage from

00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:28,949
coming to the United States because of

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,440
the xenophobic and Islamophobic tone set

00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:33,810
by the current administration either a

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,190
year perhaps into the quarter or they

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:40,139
fear danger within the country and for

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,659
the benefit of those who did make it

00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,789
here right we don't get the value with

00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:47,010
their scientific knowledge and we don't

00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:50,539
get to see our friends there are certain

00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,539
people that they should be named or

00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:04,590
from Europe Canada Brazil and Japan is

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:07,620
dead and I got through my attorney

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,870
willing to assert that there are people

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,120
who chose not company I take for this

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,240
conference because of the policies of

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,840
Business Administration see where we go

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,060
from here

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,699
I have no prescription how you made this

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,849
issue in New York City in Houston Los

00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:26,039
Angeles Peoria Omaha Alpha Beach Florida

00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:27,659
it's going to be different causation so

00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,520
I'm not don't want to hear it does not

00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:31,500
respond against because an action here

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,000
be happy to talk with you later

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,949
but this is something that I think you

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,719
should go back to success mule from a

00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:39,270
group you should discuss with your

00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:41,930
co-workers is discuss with your families

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,930
in with your neighbors

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,300
