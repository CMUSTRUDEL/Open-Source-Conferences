okay a lot of you may not know me so the

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,090
first slide is my name and my Twitter

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,349
handle because I just tweeted some

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,759
things that you all might be interested

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,080
in if you are interested in what and

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,120
what I'm about to talk about my name is

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,470
Brian Dugan including the sea because

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,240
there is a Brian Duggan at this

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,650
conference and I started including to

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,100
sea a long time ago just in case I ever

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,960
met another one yesterday was that day

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,720
so I work at best practical we developed

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,150
a request tracker and before I worked at

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,410
best practical I used to work in a

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,860
program called election protection

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,260
election protection is the United States

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,290
largest voter support and voter

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,140
monitoring program election monitoring

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,210
in the u.s. not so good the federal

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,800
government does not do anything local

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,340
governments typically don't do any

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,969
monitoring support typically begins and

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,160
ends with local election officials but

00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:00,239
support for voters is incredibly

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,860
critical in this country because they're

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,420
necessary for a fair and free election

00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,299
voter supporting the problems in this

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,310
country take form of lack of voter ID

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,619
voter intimidation formerly incarcerated

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,130
folks typically don't have many voting

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,119
rights all of these now because of the

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,600
way elections are in this country

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,549
require local activists to step up and

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,740
take action and that's what's been

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,080
happening since way way before election

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,619
protection came into existence election

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,520
protection came into existence in 2004

00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:34,890
mostly made up of pre-existing

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,150
grassroots groups so like you know

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,570
hundreds of volunteers across the

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,240
country mostly non-lawyers summer

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,770
lawyers now that my former employer

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,149
lawyers Committee for civil rights under

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,840
law involved and one technologist that

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,350
was me

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,500
I got training from best practical for

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:58,170
to to learn how to run RT so within the

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,920
span of a year I configured RT to

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,020
service election protection all for the

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,299
all for the purpose of running over this

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,450
intense intense periods of two days

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:13,380
where we took in nearly thirty thousand

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:17,610
tickets on in 2014 and then nearly

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:20,820
tickets in 2016 excuse me I gotta go

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,650
back and give more credit gossamer

00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,670
threads of course provided performance

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,130
hosting for us I didn't do everything

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,560
and we had one or two volunteers from a

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:34,080
wonderful nonprofit in California called

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:36,420
benetech and GW law school in DC my

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,990
problem was to figure out what could

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,800
address election protections intense

00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:44,850
communications and workflow problems

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,210
before I got there they had been using a

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:51,660
collection of systems no one had ever

00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:54,390
thought that maybe there's a problem and

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,030
their problem space already had

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,500
solutions nobody thought that maybe they

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,020
had a ticketing problem and they just

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,250
needed a ticketing system so what was

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,780
going to be flexible enough what was

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,510
going to be extensible enough well

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,420
supported data ownership who saw the

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:13,260
latest data breach involving MongoDB and

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,210
the RNC yeah a few people we can argue

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,710
about how sensitive that that voter data

00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,980
is the answer though is that it's

00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:22,680
incredibly sensitive

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,660
all campaigns in addition to like an

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,550
incredibly sensitive voter data being

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,650
and their all campaigns add all kinds of

00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:30,690
crazy crazy stuff about you including

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,540
the stuff that ended up in election

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,940
protections RT database that's very very

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,350
sensitive so how are we going to

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,350
maintain control of that what had a

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,030
strong community what could we purchase

00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,400
training for and what could we purchase

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,610
support for the answer was of course

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,110
well let's visit history for a second

00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:52,080
back in 2004 when they started the very

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:55,080
first programs use pen and paper 2006

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,360
maybe 2008 2010 custom solution by EFS

00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,790
the Electronic Frontier Foundation

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,590
if anybody so I have no experience with

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,940
this platform I never saw it I'm not you

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,770
know bad-mouthing the FF for whatever

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,690
reason they hired me because they wanted

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,790
to move away from that and they had a

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,320
bad experience with the Shahidi you can

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,260
see that there's two platforms a new

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,770
sheet on 2012 because you Shahidi

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:19,380
crashed before things even got going on

00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:21,450
Election Day in 2012 and then they

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,840
started using Google sheets and Google

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,419
Forms

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,960
so not the best place to put voter data

00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:31,120
probably but it's where ended up anyway

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,160
the answer was request tracker there are

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,650
a few ticketing platforms out there

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:40,300
bla bla bla but request tracker of

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:45,460
course was the answer I came in and over

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:47,169
the course of 2014 and 2016 we use

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:51,880
request tracker for voter support

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:53,260
monitoring operations to thirty thousand

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,610
tickets the first year fifty thousand

00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:00,100
tickets in last year all over the course

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,260
of about you know like really the bulk

00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,090
of that was in the eight hours of the of

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,990
the election and of course it was you

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,850
know rolling across the country and of

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,130
their using it today in Georgia special

00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:15,810
election pretty much the way I left it

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:18,160
configured so it's still up and running

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,260
the lawyers committees produced a couple

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,580
of reports about it pro públicas

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,000
election land reporting database

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:29,530
reporting project used a GPS Artie as a

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,620
primary source of data and so I just we

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:35,050
did a bunch of links at my my Twitter

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,340
account all hash tagging the Perl

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,060
conference I'm not sure if that was poor

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,740
form I also spammed best practicals a

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,419
slack Channel so sorry about spamming

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,479
everyone but if anyone is interested in

00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:48,039
any more documentation or stories about

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,160
what happened during this election and

00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:54,639
how election protection now uses Artie

00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,590
to support their voter support and

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,460
monitoring programs that's where they

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,930
can find it oops

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:05,200
pardon me during election day like the

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:07,000
pro públicas election land reporting

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,330
project produce some nice pretty graphs

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,200
you can see the biggest issues affecting

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:18,460
voters you know long wait times always

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:20,050
always always a really huge provisional

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,880
ballots I don't know if anybody have

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,860
been paying attention to the various

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,010
methods that you know Russia could have

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:30,039
used to basically denial-of-service

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:32,020
attack our voter registration rolls is

00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,570
just start flipping people to

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,510
provisional ballots

00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,950
and you know on down the line voter

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,350
intimidation can be as simple as like

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:46,930
police officer standing outside of a

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:49,300
voting station or polling place so once

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,610
again my twitter handle is BC Dugan
