so notice Trog online or the other

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:08,099
Prater or the community committee

00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,240
advocacy chairman now if you have any

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,300
questions about that

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,080
I'm sorry to begin with

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,990
as this so I am currently employed well

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,689
as of this talk I am currently employed

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,580
as a cpanel employee at houston we're

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,810
always hiring good Perl developers if

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,609
you need anybody if you want to talk

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,150
about it come up and talk to one of us

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,800
you have an inkling to move to Houston

00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,840
I'm actually there as a scrum master I

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,270
am a certified scrum master that is

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,370
scary into itself and this is the talk

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,579
about how I learn to automate my scrum

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:46,110
team or you know get rid of the nasty

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,219
parts like beginning with uh well let me

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,440
give you a little bit of my backstory

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,610
I've done a few different talks this is

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,579
going to be the first talk or actually

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,110
have code very minimal of it it's going

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,570
to be Perl I think none of its actually

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:02,460
functioning coral because where's the

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,890
fun in that I'm my name is Mark agave

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,840
Trog the other Fraser the other other

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,020
Fraser that gave you get that guy you

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,900
gave that talk about that thing or chog

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,549
we're often than not if you're looking

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,229
for the code for this one this is all

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,350
functional code I don't do live demos

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,000
because that's how you break things but

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,110
all of the code is on github on this

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,180
audio scrum there will be time for

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,350
questions at the end heckling please

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,880
save it for the end or my next talk and

00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,369
at a high level let's talk about what

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,650
scrum is you have two different

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,110
definitions of scrum one where it's a

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,880
what the actual term a holistic solution

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:47,939
for improving the user experience in a

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,350
software project or a gala terian

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,100
guilded management tool to increase

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:57,119
productivity to two-week iterations

00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:58,979
those are both equal things these are

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,310
the agile manifesto it came from the

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,960
agile manifesto which was the base of

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,700
the result of a botched attempt to

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,560
summon angelic force with the best of

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,420
intentions God can only provide a

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,979
minimum Angelle

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,510
product so that we would have to iterate

00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,400
from the framework for the mortals to

00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,810
create their own angels this isn't

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,709
laughing at any of you this is just

00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,480
bombing already but as you can see there

00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:25,100
there they are trying to summon we hope

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,260
God but thing always gets a butt inside

00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,620
of the rules of scrum during three major

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,840
roles you have your scrum master the man

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,610
who's trying to look down and see the

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,920
light that is actually my real product

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,019
owner right there and then you also have

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,250
the developers so I'll go over each of

00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:42,470
the rules and how I learn to automate

00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,819
each of them away starting off or also

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,950
in the ceremonies we'll go over those

00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:47,269
and now I oughta mated those away like

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,130
you're groomings your plantings your

00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:50,540
dailies your demos in your retro as most

00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,220
people usually only hear about the

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,510
dailies but there are more meetings to

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,459
that and there's even more meetings than

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,930
those meetings those are just the ones

00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:58,580
that care about again if you're looking

00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,670
for this scripts they are right here on

00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:06,790
github slash Drog for or TRG for a force

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:11,660
left auto scrum but going over the

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:13,070
really ah there we go we're going to

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,920
start off with automating the product

00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:18,350
owner first step in automating your

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,870
scrum team so what is a product owner

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,640
though product owners job is basically

00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,320
they're the ones who talk to the

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,170
customers so that the engineers don't

00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,870
have to it's the perfect analogy I've

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:31,280
ever heard of being a product owner they

00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,079
stand in there and they create user

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,000
stories and communicate to the customers

00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:38,420
the priority of concerns that's what

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,280
they're supposed to do but if you think

00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,540
of them as like a waiter they're not the

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,470
ones in the back of house to make the

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,570
food they're the ones that actually

00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:48,140
interact with the customer right there

00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,910
the problem being if you screw up

00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,739
something with their order it's always

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,160
the customer so it's always the waiters

00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:54,019
fault

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,120
you never decrease the tip on the back

00:03:54,019 --> 00:04:00,200
end line cook it's always the waiters

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,269
fault if you've ever like if you forget

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,410
to catch up it's the waiter so if the

00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:05,180
food comes out burnt

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,950
it's the waiters fault if you wanted

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,750
cheese on the side of it didn't tell the

00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,540
waiter realize about half way through

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,950
that you did want cheese it's still the

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,709
waiters fault even though you're the

00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,390
idiot but if you've ever had to deal

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:17,829
with customers like that you know that

00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,120
there

00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,449
horrible horrible things that should

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,919
never be dealt with so for my codes

00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:25,629
these are the three depending that you

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,509
say three dependencies that you'll have

00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:30,189
to deal with is a random line GHI and

00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:32,289
github right now I don't have it going

00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:36,639
through a full word process I just have

00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:37,840
it using github issues but let's start

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,669
off with the anatomy of these user

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,150
stories or the way that the PIO

00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:45,789
identifies and talks to the development

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,729
team usually creates stories that say as

00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:50,830
a customer I'd like to give you a this

00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:55,240
deliverable so that I can this is the

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:57,430
business value and those are the way so

00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,110
the the team knows why we're working on

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,210
what we're having to work on and who

00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,800
we're supposed to be working at for this

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,889
is a great tool and a great opportunity

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,539
but completely overdone because you only

00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,759
get about six customers that you ever

00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:11,500
have to deal with deliverable or the

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,330
business value nobody ever cares about

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,710
and the deliverables will you'll change

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,240
your mind five different ways anyway so

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,150
don't even worry about that just

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,979
randomly select those and then echo it

00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,870
out into a nice little script that way

00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:25,419
you can say as a whatever customer you

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,580
want I'd like whatever deliverable you

00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,889
got so that I can it doesn't matter

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,199
about the business value and then BOOM

00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:34,629
throw that up into github and then

00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,569
you've got an entire subset of backlogs

00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:39,849
already ordered for your team boom I got

00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:42,190
one down I got to go to the developers

00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:49,180
after this but I've automated my POA

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:50,919
you're welcome okay this scripts right

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,240
here for all your needs you can just

00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,919
tell your guys we're going to scrum I

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,620
got one of the dependencies down we just

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,259
fire those people off the next one

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,569
automating developers XP kind of we're

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,849
big pearl shops so I had to figure out

00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,289
how how do i how do i write a simple

00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:08,620
bash script to get rid of Perl

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:12,250
programmers how do I to loop down what

00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,900
it is to be these craftsmen of code the

00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,870
developer themselves and I thought to

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,190
myself well I was talking with my

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,440
brother about this and I was like I can

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,360
make a Markov chain that goes out to the

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,210
sea pan and learns the ways that sea pan

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,700
programmers write and and uses that to

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,370
generate different code

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,350
and then ya know that was way too hard

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,260
so what I basically had to do is it just

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,960
throws up some random Sipan modules and

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,680
makes them line noise at the bottom and

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:44,430
that's basically all Perl programmers do

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,140
I'm right you know I'm right ah but then

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,780
you have to go to hkey way so I figured

00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,360
I could kill two birds with one stone

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:54,600
quality assurance and review boom God

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,880
it's done you're going to be beautiful

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,130
so my code just runs through check it

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,280
the gun pearl see and then just done the

00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:07,850
story done the story got it all of my

00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:10,710
developers taken care of documentation

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:15,510
my code self-explanatory I don't need to

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:17,070
do this perfect every time now going on

00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,540
to the ceremonies and rituals all of

00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:22,800
those meetings that I've just saved you

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:24,780
time with them the grooming like most

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,590
groomings one person's really unhappy

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,950
about it just like that cat is so I took

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,480
away that annoying part of it where

00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:36,720
Pio's had to talk to customers and

00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,460
basically what you do now is instead of

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,660
talking to the customers who really

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,010
don't know what they want they're not

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,510
the ones who actually have to use the

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,340
product you're the one who's making it

00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,260
so why should you talk to them about

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,640
their problems you know what you're

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,860
doing better than they ever could

00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,980
because you write code they just work

00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,690
with it if you can't tell the smoke in

00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,520
there it's all the way down so basically

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,990
I figured it out down to the seven

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,120
different stickers the seven different

00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,680
customers that you'll ever run into this

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,940
is sad mint or always whining about

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,700
something that you did wrong with your

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,220
code the product user who you never

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,870
really talked to anyway the stakeholder

00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,290
who does sign your paychecks is stuck up

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:14,820
to them the guy with the money who sucks

00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,160
up to the stakeholder well who the

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,570
stakeholders are sucking up to so yes VC

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,670
groups because in case you have a dumb

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,170
idea you can always sell it to a venture

00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:25,350
capitalist group to saying it's the next

00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,640
big thing I'm disrupting something which

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,780
if there's any venture capitalist you

00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,820
want to take me up on this automated

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,520
scrum thing top of me afterwards I could

00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,310
use a paycheck customers I have no idea

00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,590
who those are and then grandmas the most

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,969
illiterate user of the mall those are

00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:41,029
basically all you ever have to worry

00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:44,420
about and then you just put in some

00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:45,920
random steps I mean deliverables through

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,450
the two weeks the deliverable will

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,460
change so many times that it doesn't

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,290
make sense to put it down because your

00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,970
mind is going to change anyway so just

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,870
tell the developers halfway through that

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,750
you've changed your mind

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,400
they'll be fine it's agile for a reason

00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,839
you don't actually have to give them

00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,360
things to work on you just have to tell

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:08,510
them what to do that's your job and then

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,070
the business value of it all to get a

00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,540
clean code these are just simple things

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,370
that will make people happy at the end

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,570
of it like you know why are we doing

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,370
this well don't you want to clean

00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:21,110
codebase well this has nothing to do

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:24,680
with that shut up and just moving on and

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,990
others are simple matter of buzzwords go

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,310
on to hacker news figure out the

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,430
buzzwords throw them in there

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:34,400
optimization disruption this is all work

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:37,310
out you can use those as yeah use those

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,050
as your your buzzwords make enough

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:43,430
compliance and you'll be fine this is

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:45,380
great but now that you've all that but

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,970
since I've automated the peel away you

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:51,070
no longer need to do any of this all

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,070
taken care of for you you're welcome

00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:59,720
the first meeting as well this is the

00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,770
first meeting but the next meeting that

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,940
we're going to be talking about is a

00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:06,500
planning meeting ah I did a little bit

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,910
of it and the planning meeting is the

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,380
time when the team gets around the

00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,210
developers sit down with the scrum

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,770
master and the PIO and to figure out

00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,960
what's coming up in the next schedule

00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,670
what's coming up in the next time in the

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,290
calendar week how many days off are we

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,880
going to have how who's going to be out

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,610
this week how much time do we actually

00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,780
have to sit down and talk about what

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,520
we're going to be working on for the

00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:29,480
next two weeks where are we going to be

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,950
to get ourselves on the right page that

00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,630
usually involves either the grooming

00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,520
we're planning everybody's favorite game

00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,730
planning poker if you guys have never

00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,889
heard of planning poker be grateful

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,359
everybody puts a card and they

00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:43,829
you're out what they think a general

00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:46,359
estimate of what the stories are and

00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:48,040
they use a modified Fibonacci sequence

00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:50,259
if you have the little card to do

00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,359
everything but it's an easy way to

00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:55,059
figure out is this a one or is this

00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:57,040
double the complexity is this even more

00:10:55,059 --> 00:11:00,309
complex than that and more complex than

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,319
that and what you're supposed to do is

00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:04,179
you think about the problem in all of

00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:06,189
this complexity not just how long it'll

00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:08,679
take you to make it but how much of a

00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:10,509
complex project is this holistically how

00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:12,220
big is this to go from the programmers

00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:14,079
all the way down to the QA to get it

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,109
delivered to the customer so you're not

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,970
just sizing it on is it bigger or is it

00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:21,970
smaller it's also how much time will

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,889
this take me to figure out what's going

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,449
on how complex is this code base how

00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:27,249
screwed up and how much technical debt

00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:29,709
do I have to get through just to change

00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:33,609
a one-line fix so that I can capitalize

00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:40,179
a letter on the landing page not that I

00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:42,189
know that one but since we don't like to

00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:44,139
have any programmers or POS or

00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:46,360
developers anymore that's not going to

00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:48,519
happen so what I've done is I've broken

00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,869
down planning poker so that you two can

00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,419
still have the fun of planning poker

00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:54,549
I've taken this modified of Fibonacci

00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:56,439
sequence right here I've figured out

00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:58,749
that I can do it through random lines

00:11:56,439 --> 00:12:00,100
it'll pick it out and basically I

00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:01,929
realize that all the programmers ever

00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,269
really do is just choose a random number

00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,529
below 20 and then hold it up that's what

00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:08,079
happened in every meeting I've been at

00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:09,819
see exactly a nice nursing so what I've

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,459
done is I've got my five little

00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:16,929
developers there a B C D and E

00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:18,579
I love E and I have them basically just

00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:22,059
throwing up lines and when they finally

00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:23,709
brew Statistics hit the same number

00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:26,259
print that one out and that's the size

00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:30,970
of the story because my planning poker

00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:33,639
works right the daily the daily the

00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,169
greatest most well-known meeting of the

00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,449
scrum process where everybody gets up

00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:38,980
and they answer the three questions what

00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:40,660
did i do today what do I plan on doing

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,459
tomorrow and am I being impeded by

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,319
something it's your time to tell your

00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:45,579
team hey this is what I'm planning I'm

00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:45,960
working on these are the parts of the

00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:47,550
code

00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,170
that I'm going to be working with this

00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,640
is what I plan on doing afterwards

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:54,810
hey also I need help with this part

00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,640
that's not actually what happens

00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,890
generally what happens is just a log

00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,960
file of what you've done so I create a

00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,670
guy's log file it pushes out the story

00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,350
says this one was done this is what I

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,330
worked on I move this story to done

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,250
doesn't matter if you're impeded I'll

00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,870
figure it out myself I'm too proud to

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,010
ask for anything and I'm not going to

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,730
tell you what I'm doing next the time I

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,730
figured it out yet

00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:23,040
Wow its lawsuit now we come to the demo

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,410
the demo has actually split into two

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,940
different parts little-known sprint

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,700
review and then there's a sprint demo

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,470
the sprint review is where you talk to

00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,940
you the product owner and the team

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,529
presents the work that they've done to

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,510
the product over the product owner goes

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:37,950
over it and says I think in this two

00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,200
weeks you guys have figured out exactly

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,120
what the customers want or I think the

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,010
customer wants something else I've

00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,600
talked with them and this is the time of

00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,010
the stakeholders and the customers and

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,089
all of that can come around look at what

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,220
you've made and say I think you're on

00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:51,810
the right path or I don't think you're

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,089
quite on the right path at this point as

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,770
opposed to the product demo the product

00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:58,050
demo is where you're actually sitting

00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:00,089
out and showing off the actual product

00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,100
this is what I've made so far this is

00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,170
what the customers can use this is

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,760
directly in the customers hands this you

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,440
can play with this you can type please

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,100
God break it that way we can fix it that

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:14,580
way we can make it better for you now in

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,320
actuality you've got the product demo

00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,790
coming out and then that's pretty review

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,290
that sprint review is where the team

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,800
says this is what I made put up or shut

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,720
up

00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,660
product owner says I don't care let's

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,160
just move it on a product demo is even

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,660
more fun because then you come out with

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,579
this half-assed piece of code that's

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,750
sitting there the customers have no idea

00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,940
what it's used for because they've never

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,020
been talked to the team really doesn't

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,300
know what they were coding they were

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,610
just kind of fitted put a let's

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,290
go with fussing around with technical

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,610
debt inside the back end and they've

00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,399
created something that kind of half

00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,110
meets the customers expectations but in

00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,940
another two weeks we'll get even closer

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:54,510
to what you want it it'll never be done

00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:58,529
it will be closer that takes us to the

00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:59,529
fun fun meeting the retro which the

00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:02,379
treachery

00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:05,470
I don't look for retro images and on

00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:08,019
Google you get some weird things and yes

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,759
downloading images of Google well as the

00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:11,759
Patent Office it didn't lose its irony

00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:20,970
so with those the retro at the time for

00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:23,410
the soft skills the the human part of a

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,699
scrum team to get together and to say

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,279
hey this is how we're working together

00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:30,100
this is how I feel at work I either feel

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,629
good about my work or I feel bad about

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,980
my work and here's why here's some

00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:35,589
things that I think we can do to improve

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,480
as a team we're all humans and we all

00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:38,860
have to work together and these are some

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,439
of the communication breakdowns that we

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:44,079
have and that's great that's a really

00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:47,589
good thing to have if you have humans

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,970
but I don't have humans so all you

00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:50,350
really need to do for the retrospective

00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,839
at this point make sure your codes still

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,399
working and that's it it's basically

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,389
just a system checks every two weeks

00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,370
boom system check I know what you're

00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:02,050
thinking the scrum master how did I

00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,540
automate the scrum master away how did I

00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:08,319
lose my own job how do you improve upon

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:10,540
the scrum master job you don't it just

00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:12,309
doesn't happen were perfect it happens

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,029
all the time we are needed we are

00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:15,220
employable

00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:17,230
we need money like a venture capitalist

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:22,420
money you can't fire me basically

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:25,089
everything is just don't fire me the

00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:28,870
scrum master rule there is the perfect

00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:32,620
person to to take care of tinker and

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,750
help you whether it's a machine team or

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,579
even a person team to help you figure

00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,139
out how can I make this process go

00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:41,649
better how can I make this process go

00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:43,929
faster what kind of communication errors

00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:45,220
can I help you guys take down and that's

00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:47,670
what they're trained for and that's what

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,079
they do whether it's making snarky

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:53,199
versions of you using simple bash

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,059
scripts or having one-on-one

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,809
conversations with how you really do

00:16:55,059 --> 00:17:00,309
hate that guy in HR are there any

00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,809
questions though I mean there shouldn't

00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:09,419
be because I'm amazing this talk was

00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:09,419
amazing and you know yes we're cool

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:23,690
daddy pig

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:27,010
dubbing still shop it off true I am

00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,010
still working on this talk a little bit

00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:46,480
there yeah that works but nearly not

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,480
nearly as fun as stealing images yeah

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,620
is anybody actually have besides the

00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:58,790
cPanel group anybody here actually using

00:17:51,620 --> 00:18:02,240
scrum mm-hmm once you go onto the 13 it

00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:06,160
doesn't go to 20 or doesn't go to 21 it

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:09,140
goes to 20 and then 20 to 40 40 to 80

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,520
that when you're sizing epics I have

00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:12,110
hood came to the threads their epics and

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,730
all that or had change that size their

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,020
epics and went to 40's and all of that

00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:19,430
that we think it break down each

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:20,630
individual sprint off of it I've got

00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,890
some healthy teams that actually could

00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,270
do that I've had some other teams that

00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:31,730
were like this was a 40 why cuz I don't

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:34,610
wanna do it what there there are other

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,930
ways of doing the estimations and stuff

00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,450
like that I just read about a time-based

00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:42,200
one where you can use the Fibonacci

00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,940
sequence on it but then it goes into it

00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,440
got really kind of obscure because you

00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,680
take your optimistic you're pessimistic

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,390
and you're most likely to happen you

00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,580
take each of those estimates average

00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,860
those in time everybody takes those

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,970
everybody averages those and then if

00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,440
it's a project that you've done so

00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,510
you've done a couple of times you

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,760
actually wait the most likely four times

00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,830
and the divided by six so they'll get

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,710
you even more and that one will actually

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:09,620
get you a standard deviation of time on

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:12,400
how and I was like why the hell it's an

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,400
estimate man

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,150
yes I know

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,390
notice all about and this is also a

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:23,320
thing is this is me learning to program

00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:24,580
oh that guy just always goes down to

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,020
zero that's the he skewers under

00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,970
standard deviation every time the

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:32,020
Russian judge will always screw standard

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:36,060
deviation anything else but I will give

00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,060
