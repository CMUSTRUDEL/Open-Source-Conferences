Description: 
	I spend a lot of time working from my car. It's a lot of fun but sometimes it can be very lonely. The Raspberry Pi 3 is an amazing piece of kit, and with the help of some friends you can do very interesting things with it. Like build yourself an personal digital assistant for your car.

this is make new friends um I subtitled

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,360
it at the last minute a hobbyist guide

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:17,220
to conversational UI and the Internet of

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:21,029
Things um I'm a contractor I work

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,010
remotely I've worked remotely for close

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,810
to 10 years now or I've worked as a

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,960
contractor for close to 10 years now I

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,849
work remotely I work from home um this

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,219
is not exactly an accurate description

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,520
of what my day-to-day life is but next

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,380
week Sean this is going to look a lot

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,390
like the stand-ups because I'm at the

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:45,360
beach next week um which is a fantastic

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,329
place to be and I really enjoy it

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,660
but there's some downsides to it ah my

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,309
car is my office um yes I work from home

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,170
but my son's school is a half an hour

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,760
drive so I would be taking 2 hours out

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,579
of my day to drive him to school and

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,480
back so instead of doing that I Drive

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,890
him to school I go find a local park or

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,720
parking spot or some place and I work

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,520
for my car I work for my park bench

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,900
mostly because I don't like coffee and

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,909
starbucks gets a little on your nerves

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:17,549
after about three hours um I have almost

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,009
this exact model of car uh but in a

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,009
light blue so yes I'm polluting the

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,200
world like crazy right now um I did get

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,740
the fix on my TDI but it's a wonderful

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,049
car I highly recommend it for people um

00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:34,320
but the downside is I've got a lot of

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,270
alone time now I would be a

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,340
card-carrying member of the introvert

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,930
society if I'd ever attended one of the

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,409
introvert society meetings but that

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,270
defeats the point um my brother who is a

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,649
card-carrying member was at the meeting

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:53,340
holding the cards and wondered why

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:54,720
nobody showed up um so when you have a

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,930
lot of alone time and a lot of downtime

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,409
and when I started the idea for this

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:05,909
talk I was unemployed um looking for a

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:08,310
new contract what's your solution well

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,349
let's make some friends I took this a

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,790
little literally in this case where I'm

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,890
tempting to take this little little

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:17,340
early in this case

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:19,800
um problem when I started this I was

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,460
unemployed as of January I became very

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,410
employed the contract is a legacy code

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,360
base with a legacy no that's replacing

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,580
an even more legacy code base it

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,080
involves lots of time of deep diving and

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,610
code generation so what started out as a

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,960
talk where I was going to have this

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,970
really great thing to show off to you

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,260
guys now become a talk where I'm going

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,370
to show off the ideas of this really

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,320
great things I'm going to show you next

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:48,960
year um but I had a solution to being

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,260
really busy how many people know me

00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,150
Ogawa me Ogawa does the sinkhole

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,770
conference driven development where he

00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:02,370
signs up for a talk for something he

00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:04,110
hasn't written yet and then implements

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,250
it pretty much on the plane ride to

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,160
wherever he's going

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:12,300
unfortunately I drove so that kind of

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:19,860
fell down um so what were my goals for

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:21,030
my new friends um one I could do a some

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,000
sort of home on you know some sort of

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,110
animation project but that's kind of

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
boring and doesn't really fit what I

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,709
need if you want to do this the talk

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,970
right before this which is a terrible

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,370
thing to do unless somebody's a time

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,320
traveler that was a great talk check out

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,090
the YouTube video of it later he did

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,600
some great things with Alexa Amazon and

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,310
pearl but this is what I wanted to do my

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,250
car is a car I'm not going to tell it to

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:48,540
turn off the lights um that's just

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,269
dangerous um you could do information

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,430
retrieval you know things like Google of

00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:55,200
hey Google what's the whopper and then

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,810
you know it'll place 15 seconds of a

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,200
whopper ad for you has anybody seen that

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,900
video

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,269
Burger King got Swift they took out a

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,820
15-second ad and it wasn't enough time

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:07,800
to demonstrate what a whopper is so they

00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,050
just ended the ad with hey Google what's

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,930
a whopper and then Google Holmes started

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:16,260
talking to the person watching the video

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:19,320
um but this is boring I run pearl how

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,440
many people are at IRC approach so you

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,590
know the bots pearl pea URL I run that

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,630
bot now

00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,800
so I already do a lot of information

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,200
retrieval it's not good information

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,419
trust me she is not good information but

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,450
that's a boring project that's a that's

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:36,250
a problem I've already solved we could

00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,010
do task management this is much more

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,510
interesting or well much more useful but

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,040
it's still kind of boring how many

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:46,389
people use tasks warrior or a task

00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,980
managing program I find time I've

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:49,870
started using tasks warrior it's amazing

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,400
it does what I want and yes eventually I

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:55,450
will probably tie it into all of this

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,860
stuff sorry my brother left his throne

00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,150
last night and it started telling me

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:04,270
that my talk is going on right now

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:05,560
oh so this is this is useful but it's

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,389
boring and I will eventually get into

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,220
doing some sort of task management like

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:10,240
hey what's next to my to-do list what's

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,460
the next thing I'm supposed to be

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,430
working on this week you know do I have

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:18,130
a meeting in like 10 minutes

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,560
um more useful and really interesting to

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,419
me would be a rubber duck how many

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,760
people know what rubber duck problems

00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:27,760
are a teddybear problem is okay so some

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,840
of you teddy bearing is when a rubber

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,789
ducky is when you go and talk to

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,710
somebody because you're having a problem

00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,450
and they don't say a single thing but

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,880
just the process of trying to explain it

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,400
to them gives you enlightenment into the

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,140
answer you know I'm really running into

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,410
the wait wait a second never mind I got

00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:46,120
it and you walk out you know um but this

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:50,200
is a hard problem this this falls into

00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:53,289
like AI hard kind of Turing tests type

00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,520
stuff because ultimately it has to give

00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:57,010
you feedback in a creative and

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,389
interesting way which I love that's the

00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,639
stuff that I really want to get into

00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:07,600
with this conversational UI but it's

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:11,470
hard but simpler is the formal process

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:15,280
of scrum how many people saw of my

00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:17,320
brothers scrum automating scrum talk if

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,729
you don't you should take a chance to

00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,639
take a look at it it goes over the

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:23,200
process of scrum in a slightly snarky

00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:27,160
way let's get with slightly snarky

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:30,340
because that's fair um and he's a scrum

00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,810
master at cPanel and he really believes

00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,460
that the only person you can't really

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,550
automate out of the scrum process is the

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,640
scrum master

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,840
um I think that you can do that too I

00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:43,400
don't think his job is actually

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,050
necessary um most of the formal process

00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,580
you can automate a way you can do daily

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:51,110
stand-ups you can do some form of retros

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,030
and stuff like that as an automated

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,220
process where you have a bot this is

00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,320
their ances what did you do yesterday

00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,490
and you tell it and it record that what

00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,380
did you what are you going to do today

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,210
and you tell it and you would do you

00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,100
have any problems blocking you you tell

00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,350
it and it records that and post it

00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,650
somewhere where you can use ibly use it

00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,230
later

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,940
that's actually useful for me that's

00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,280
very useful for me as a solo developer

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,290
sitting on a park bench somewhere

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,030
without a scrum team thankfully right

00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,440
now I have a team of people that are

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,840
wonderful and I can do this and we have

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,400
daily stand-ups and Simmons process but

00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,500
when I was on my own and for my personal

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,430
projects I don't have that this would be

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,930
useful so let's get into some show and

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,490
palette is this is the important part

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,890
this is the part that I really had fun

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,470
and started writing out on and is why my

00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,660
talk is possibly more late and possibly

00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,670
more than the work part is because I got

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:46,040
so involved in what's the best choice

00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:47,930
for all of this hardware I wanted

00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,750
something portable obviously I'm working

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:54,200
from my car um it needs to be working

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,880
offline not just because I'm working for

00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,460
my car and you know you can get a data

00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,940
plan for reasonable amounts of money

00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:06,320
well not reasonable amounts of money but

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:07,970
you can get a data plan but security

00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,770
wise do you really want something that

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,450
Google's listening to you all the time

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,480
wherever you are when you're driving no

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,530
and I'm okay with that so I want

00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,850
something portable something will work

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,110
off lines and they work in a park

00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,700
something to work when I don't

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:23,870
necessarily have some sort of cell phone

00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:25,790
reception um I want something that's

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,610
easy to program I'm not a hardware guy I

00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,350
started out writing web software I try

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,600
and write web software to this day I

00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,720
don't want to deal with the hardware if

00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,820
I can if I can avoid it I get confused

00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,840
at letters like FPGA and Arduino and

00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:44,270
make a thirty-two and it's neat I'm

00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,710
starting to learn more of it I'm about

00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,240
to get a keyboard that shaped like a

00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,230
butterfly that apparently has an Arduino

00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,690
in it

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:55,100
I hope but I'm not there yet so I need

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,980
something that's easy to program some

00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:01,670
industry for it and I want something

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:04,130
cheap because if I'm in the park and it

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,590
starts raining I don't want my wife to

00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,690
yell at me you did what to your device

00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:11,060
we spent how much money and it's now wet

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,550
and it won't work anymore so I need to

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,580
be cheap and replaceable we stay within

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,960
surrounded with reasonable places there

00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,450
so the first thing raspberry pi's I've

00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,700
seen is mentioned three four times this

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:27,950
week and various talks these things are

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:31,520
incredible forward about this big

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:34,610
I have 128 make hard disk on here it

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,610
boots off the USB Drive it's a fantastic

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:40,850
little device on my desktop computer for

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,160
at work or for work at home went on the

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,780
fritz for about three weeks I was able

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,670
to replace it with this because I had it

00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:52,210
sitting on the desk anyway and it just

00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:52,210
worked I absolutely love my Raspberry Pi

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,720
second I need some way of doing audio I

00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:01,400
want to talk to this device I needed to

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:04,850
do audio which is perfect I can do

00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,410
Bluetooth hands-free possibly not the

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,020
way this guy does it I actually have

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:12,680
headphones my car has a Bluetooth

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:16,010
hands-free set up in it this is perfect

00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,590
for my life well except it's not the

00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:21,890
Broadcom chipset that the Raspberry Pi

00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:23,720
uses has some issues one the driver for

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,030
it is a binary blob because product

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,740
Broadcom has an open-sourced it and two

00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,540
it doesn't work exactly right all the

00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,270
time and by exactly right all the time I

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:37,730
mean roughly any of the use cases I had

00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:40,460
for it um up to and including getting on

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,400
the Wi-Fi and a Bluetooth keyboard and a

00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,900
bluetooth mouse at the same time

00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,840
confused it and caused all three of them

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:50,210
to crash which is not the most useful

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,920
and the way I discovered it cause in the

00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:57,020
crashes you type the K key and it would

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,700
type K for three hours um so you get

00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,200
around that if you notice I have another

00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,920
dongle in here that the Bluetooth dong

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,559
bluetooth dongle

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,189
well to offset so I'm not using the same

00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:11,429
chipset for both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth it

00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:13,170
has some issues um so let's step back

00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:14,639
and see okay well what can we do maybe

00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:20,069
we can make this more like a LexA where

00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:22,319
it has a a big device one of the

00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:24,959
solutions this is a hardware word it's a

00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:27,660
hat in the Raspberry Pi community it

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,220
plugs into the GPIO port um it's called

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,379
the matrix creator they have a new one

00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,480
called the matrix voice it's a slick

00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:38,339
piece of hardware from what I've seen

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,629
from the spec sheets um and I say for

00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,819
what I've seen from the spec sheets

00:11:39,629 --> 00:11:44,790
because the problem there was it got

00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:50,459
lost in the mail it was supposed to

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:53,989
arrive last week and thankfully it

00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,989
managed to arrive this morning

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,499
I'm staying someplace where I didn't

00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:00,629
know the address so I had it delivered

00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:02,519
to Rick and Rick drop this off to me

00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:05,970
this morning so I've had this for all of

00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:08,639
four hours now so I've had no time to

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,769
integrate this but it has an eight mic

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,589
array on the Boro seven mic array on the

00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:15,059
back it has FPGA board it has detection

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:18,360
settings it has LED lights on the front

00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:20,939
it's really slick hardware it's designed

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,369
to do this kind of stuff it doesn't

00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:24,749
exactly fall into the cheap category the

00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:26,939
matrix voice that they're coming out

00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:29,790
with is about fifty bucks this is about

00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:32,549
a hundred bucks so it's not break the

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:35,249
bank bad but it's not I want to get this

00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:38,040
wet and rain bad but it's designed

00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:41,759
specifically for this purpose okay

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:45,269
that's not bad a little cheaper and my

00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:49,739
current solution until this morning was

00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:52,289
this this is the ps3 I camera the camera

00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:55,410
that the Sony sold for the PlayStation 3

00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:57,899
to do online games this is actually a

00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:01,049
really neat piece of kit this is I've

00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:04,139
got a Formica ray it's got a camera that

00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:05,669
does I forget the least 10 frames per

00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:09,119
second so you know blazing fast

00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:10,439
high-quality frame right there um mostly

00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:12,869
I was interested in the microphone so

00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:14,039
but it's highly directional at point you

00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:15,690
have to point it towards where you're

00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:19,140
sitting for it to work really well

00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:22,620
but unlike the hundred dollar board this

00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:26,400
was $7.00 off Amazon and was available

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:31,170
next day delivery so it was slick you

00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:32,970
plug it in and it just works for some

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:38,160
version of just works which we'll get to

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:39,540
in a little bit um my display well

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,800
technically I don't need to display and

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,920
I'm trying to design this as it doesn't

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:49,040
have to use a display but I do have a

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:52,440
nifty little screen in my car that has a

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,810
connector port that is a bespoke Amazon

00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,060
connector or a bespoke Volkswagen

00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:59,670
connector port because I bought a 2015

00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:03,720
model and the 2016 models is when they

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:05,070
released it with USB 2016 is also when

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,110
they released it but that's cheap for

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,110
the omission so I got screwed twice um

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,800
but you can buy an RCA adapter to the

00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,200
bespoke and then you can plug the RCA

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,730
adapter into an HD out HDMI adapter and

00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,380
plug the HDMI adapter into the Raspberry

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,720
Pi and I actually have a picture on

00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,660
Twitter of me booting my Raspberry Pi

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:31,230
onto the screen in my car which is uber

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:32,700
nerdy and my wife just sorta like is

00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:39,410
that why you were sitting in the car for

00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:42,420
an extra hour yes and H um software umm

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:44,520
this yeah the joke at the bottom is I

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,840
have a friend who will probably watch

00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,390
this video later who's one of the few

00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:52,530
people I know who uses nano

00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:57,030
professionally to edit corporal um he's

00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:59,280
the masochist I think oh so software was

00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:00,870
what are the tools that I'm putting

00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,770
together to make this happen

00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:10,500
um there are so many choices for doing

00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:12,960
software um there's a a bunch of

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,900
different projects for doing alexa alexa

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,760
integration google home integration most

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,900
of the tutorials you'll find if you

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,750
start googling around for how to do

00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,430
voice automation on a Raspberry Pi have

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,440
you go to the Google Voice server

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,660
because that's what they do text

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,490
recognition with because it's really

00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,790
good will get

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,839
in a second the choices that I used are

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:34,550
the ones that I'm using for my

00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:36,920
constraints it has to work offline it

00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,420
has to do I want I have I'm a software

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,070
guy so I have this big thing in my head

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:46,100
about how that I want the software to be

00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:50,120
arranged um I have so big thing a little

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,399
digression big thing in my head I have a

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,390
talk on that I gave last year not last

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,550
year in 2014 about cognitive theory that

00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,589
my business partner wrote my business

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,410
partner I are really kind of nerdy about

00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:04,940
a cognitive theory and how the brain

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,930
works and modeling and metaphors and

00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,390
some of that stuff if you get a chance

00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,800
you should check out the talk if you'd

00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,330
like I can come and give the talk to

00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:15,010
whatever local for a longer group you

00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:18,830
have over Skype or otherwise um

00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:21,470
there's four parts to the the model that

00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,089
I'm trying to build but I'm really only

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,570
implementing two right now because the

00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:28,010
budget shortfalls mostly time budgeting

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:30,649
there's a how many people have read

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,330
Daniel Kahneman's of thinking fast and

00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:37,100
thinking slow or have at least heard of

00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:41,990
it a couple people conovan won a Nobel

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:44,720
Prize I think for his work on thinking

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:46,040
on cognitive systems and basically has

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,360
this theory that there's two systems

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,190
there's a fast system that you think

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,860
about impulsively where you just react

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:54,380
to things it's it's very fast it's kind

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:57,290
of stupid it gets things wrong about 20%

00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,089
of the time and then you have these your

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,880
automatic systems in my case this is the

00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,079
speech recognition the text-to-speech

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,490
natural language understanding systems

00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:05,900
the things that happen really

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,410
automatically would don't take a lot of

00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:13,339
deep diving and processing power to work

00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:15,339
through my speech recognition system

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:17,839
right now I'm using

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:20,540
snowboy which is a project on github

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:25,420
that does keyword detection it runs a

00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:28,700
tight seal loop Andrew Rutland Hobbs

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,380
wrote me a Perl wrapper for it you can

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,260
program it to do stop word which is the

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,300
alexa blah blah blah the alexa part is a

00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,070
stop word the alexa device has a little

00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,570
c loop that sits you're listing for you

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,850
to say alexa and then it triggers the

00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,260
rest of everything is supposed to do

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,510
snowboy will let you program in

00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,130
any stop words you want you just give it

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,750
three sound files of you saying

00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,580
something and it matches your audio

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,549
stream to that and then triggers an

00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:56,480
event from that what it'll trigger in my

00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:58,700
case is pocket six pockets links is not

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,230
the best text recognition system on the

00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:06,140
planet but it's the best that runs on a

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:07,010
Raspberry Pi easily that I found in the

00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,270
last six months

00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:15,590
um text-to-speech text-to-speech was a

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:19,460
pain in the butt to figure out um the

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:23,330
free systems all sound like the old

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:25,400
version of Stephen Hawking not the new

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:29,390
version of Stephen Hawking um they're

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,650
all very broken up very automated and

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,179
don't sound very clean and they're

00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,760
difficult to listen to for extended

00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:36,620
periods of times the new systems any of

00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,720
the modern systems that are very for pay

00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,890
are brilliant they sound really good

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,520
there's some systems out there that

00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:45,790
sound incredible and do pro City and and

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,980
South you know they can fake Obama and

00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:50,690
Trump's voices in really intelligent

00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,380
ways and sound like actual human

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:56,240
speaking um but you can't actually buy

00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,190
any of those systems I tried I tried

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,360
buying several different systems

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,610
figuring out different ways to do it

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,190
they all sell to want they all want to

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:07,040
sell to large corporate clients except

00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:10,940
cap estriol capacitor was willing to

00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:15,440
sell me a voice engine for the Raspberry

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:18,070
Pi for about $15 I forget exactly how

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,419
much I paid it was about that much and

00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,850
they were wonderful and they have a

00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:25,070
special history for a pearl because

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,299
Kevin lens Oh started this conference

00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,110
well what this conference used to be

00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:31,520
called and he started them as well so

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:35,360
they were fantastic and they have really

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,440
good voice to speech pearl I use pearl

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,730
to glue everything together because I'm

00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:42,080
a programmer first system to the slow

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:46,070
and deliberate system this does the long

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,500
thinking I'm using a conversation engine

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:52,250
called superscript j s how many people

00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,840
have heard of AI ml or any of the so

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,240
there's these systems out there that do

00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:02,900
chatterbox they're written to Jenner

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:04,280
make conversations and they do basically

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,140
you give them a text then it comes up

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,390
with a response it's a very long

00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,130
complicated way of doing that

00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,840
chatter script where super script is

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,020
based on something in Perl called Raya

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,840
scripts which is on Sipan super script

00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:20,510
is written in JavaScript and it's a

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,160
little bit more powerful than a rive

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,300
script and it has a few more plugins for

00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,860
some of the stuff I'm using for

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:30,400
sentiment detection and some of that

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:33,860
stuff um so what now

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:39,320
the abysus I don't actually have a

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:41,210
functioning system yet um my goal is to

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,450
get all of these pieces that I now have

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:50,210
since they got delivered this morning uh

00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:55,429
glued together in a functional way but

00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:57,200
I'm not very quite yet I'm really short

00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:59,690
on time but I'm perfectly happy to

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,080
answer any questions I have about all of

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,870
this

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,460
I'll put the slides and my notes and the

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:07,910
links to the repository that all of this

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:10,040
is in online um but I'm happy to answer

00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:13,170
questions now or at any point this

00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:19,479
conference so thank you

00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:19,479
[Applause]

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,550
it's it's the difference between the

00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:52,190
Daleks and Siri caps troll is almost

00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:57,650
Siri quality as far as text-to-speech it

00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:59,510
it really is quite nice oh and that was

00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,340
the reason I went I was trying to find

00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:05,030
something other than festival because I

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:11,840
didn't want to exterminate myself while

00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:14,930
I was trying to work um anyone else I'll

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:18,070
also have this stuff here or around for

00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:21,940
to show off if people want to see it

00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,940
okay thank you

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,230
