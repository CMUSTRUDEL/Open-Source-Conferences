Description: 
	Dates and times are confusing and crazy. What nut invented Daylight Saving Time? Someone who'd never imagined a computer, that's who!

Dealing with dates and times might seem simple at first, but there's a lot of gotchas.

This talk will start by covering some concepts worth knowing about (What is an Olson timezone? What's the Gregorian Calendar?).

After that we'll talk about how the DateTime suite of modules can make your life a little easier. I'll show you some best practices for working with dates and times, and highlight some gotchas in DateTime's API, and with datetimes in general.


Dave Rolsky has been a Perl developer since 1999, and has created or contributed to dozens of CPAN modules, including DateTime, Log::Dispatch, Params::Validate, and more. He is also a member of the Moose core development team, and in early 2009 completed a TPF grant to substantially rewrite and expand the Moose documentation. Way back when, he co-wrote Embedding Perl in HTML with Mason and RT Essentials, both published by O'Reilly.

He spends a lot of his free time on animal advocacy, and otherwise vegetates with video games, books, and TV shows, like any proper nerd.
