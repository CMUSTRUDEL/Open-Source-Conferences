Title: Steven Lembark - "Dockerizing CPAN Testers: Running an Isolated Test Site"
Publication date: 2017-06-22
Playlist: TPC 2017 in DC
Description: 
	The CPAN testers network is an amazing outgrowth of Perl's "tesing culture". Authors get their modules tested on hundreds of O/S and Perl platform combinations. Setting up and managing a machine dedicated to testing can be difficult, however, even a virtual machine requires a lot of extra work to keep running. Docker (containers in general) provide an alternative: all it requires is the shared libraries for Perl and a way to import CPAN modules for tesing. The ability to manage resources and suspend/restart the containers also makes this nice for background work on larger systems.

This talk discusses the basics of setting up the CPAN testers code in a docker container and running the test cycle for in-house testing or as part of the general tester's network.

Steve Lembark has been playing with Perl for a while.
