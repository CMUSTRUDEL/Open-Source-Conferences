Title: Andrew Grangaard - "Adventures in Failure: Error handling culture across languages"
Publication date: 2017-06-22

Description: 
	Modern programming languages have a wide spectrum of error handling methods and related cultural expectations.

I'll lead you on a brief tour of various error handling patterns and paradigms and their strengths and failings. As a polyglot dabbler, I've done just enough with each of these languages to have formed cranky opinions.

By the end, we'll have new patterns to apply to our perl code (be in perl5 or perl6).

Compare and contrast:

C inspired return values in C, perl5 and go
Java vs Python exceptions
Erlang: "let it crash" approach,
Rust: Failure vs Panic
monadic: Rust Option and Haskell Maybe.
pattern matching
whatever it is that perl6 does ;)

Perl-loving polyglot Engineer. I fix things. Former Electrical Engineer, now I write software. la.pm.org nerd-herder for a decade. I've used perl for forever (I remember grumpily updating perl4 code for perl5 semantics). After a 6 year python diversion I'm back writing perl at ZipRecruiter.
