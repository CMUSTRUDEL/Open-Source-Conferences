Title: Brian Duggan - "Extending Perl 6 Command Line Argument Parsing using Metaprogramming"
Publication date: 2017-06-22
Playlist: TPC 2017 in DC
Description: 
	Perl 6 has amazing built-in features for writing command-line utilities. But sometimes even those aren't enough. In this talk, we push it further to allow features such as subcommands, command-specific help and interleaved positional and named arguments. We use metaprogramming to look up dispatch tables for multi-candidates, scrutinize signatures, and query POD declarator blocks. We show how integration with command line argument parsing is a practical application of Perl 6's rich meta-object protocol.
