Title: Jay Hannah - "Civic Hacking: TIF is millions of YOUR tax dollars"
Publication date: 2017-06-22
Playlist: TPC 2017 in DC
Description: 
	I wrote a thing: The Nebraska TIF Report: http://nebraska.tif.report/

Tax Increment Financing (TIF) is one of those dry, abstract governmental issues that has powerful effects on how we live. TIF was originally conceived to promote economic development in marginalized areas. But is YOUR tax money supporting projects like low-income housing, homeless shelters, and drug rehabilitation clinics? Or are YOUR tax dollars being spent on kickbacks to developers of high income apartments and condos?

I live in Nebraska. I'll show you how we took years of Excel spreadsheets and normalized the data into an SQLite database, and then generated a static website which we hope will help people decide whether or not they're happy with how their tax dollars are being spent.

Maybe you can shine a light on TIF where you live?

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,710
my name is J Hannah this talk is about

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,049
TIF which is tax increment financing and

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:11,309
I am NOT a policy wonk I'm kind of a

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:13,559
data nerd gofer of data monkey kind of

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,839
guy so if you want a lot of policy

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,660
information on TIF you might want to

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,869
double check in your area compared to

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,600
what I'm saying here what is this so tax

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,250
increment financing was originally

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,439
conceived depending on who you ask

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,679
to promote economic development in

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,059
marginalized or blighted areas right and

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,550
this is a really powerful tool that a

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,309
city can use to get things that wouldn't

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,550
otherwise be created created in the

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,890
community so hopefully if you're

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,739
socially progressive we can take some

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,660
tax base and apply it to things that we

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,270
all want but are not economically viable

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,750
by themselves we can support those

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,829
things actually happening so is that

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,250
where your tax dollars are actually

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:02,399
going it's possible they are maybe your

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,010
tax dollars are going to those social

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,210
goods but it's possible that your tax

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,950
dollars are going to things that you

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,790
wouldn't be happy about your tax dollars

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,500
going to so how do you know if that's

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,700
what's happening in your area well

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,580
you're going to look at if where you

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:24,240
live because there is a wild variety of

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:27,689
open data accessibility and application

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,430
of TIF tax policy across the US and now

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,350
in Canada there's a big Montreal debate

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,430
going on a couple months ago about

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,320
whether or not Tiff's entering Montreal

00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:39,180
so if you're lucky I have Melissa

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,040
Nebraska if you're lucky there's a

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,159
really good resource at the state level

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,829
where you can see all the TIF that's

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,950
going on in the entire state so we have

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,850
the Nebraska Department of Revenue has a

00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,130
department that handles this stuff and

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,430
there's that all the data for the entire

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,740
state is sitting there in where you live

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,299
is like an Illinois you're going to have

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,369
a lot of city level and county level

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,350
separate disparate information that's

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,270
not aggregated possibly but you'll have

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,489
to check it out in Nebraska there's been

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,300
a thousand 92 TIF projects so far since

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,420
1992 that have been a

00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,660
so in Nebraska we have the property

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:18,280
assessment of you and there's two

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,790
options here there's a PDF files option

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,680
and an excel files option and if we look

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,200
at the PDF file option this is a three

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,900
hundred and seventy page PDF for 2016

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,340
which is really pretty for humans like

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,430
if you're a human that wants to sit down

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:37,870
for some light reading this is great

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:40,780
right on page 324 you'll find like an

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:43,300
example this is 370 pages page 324 might

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,400
look like this this one's the closest

00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,560
one to my house so I found this one

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,050
pretty interesting so again if you're a

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,360
human reading a piece of paper this is

00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,900
great but if your data programmer trying

00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:59,460
to expose the information in aggregate

00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:02,380
370 pages a year of PDS is not great

00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:05,350
fortunately Nebraska again at the state

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,630
level so props to them x1 as Excel files

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,920
instead so we can use Microsoft Excel

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:14,730
files to pull this data out so we did we

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,959
pulled all the Excel information out and

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:20,050
stuck it in a sequel Lite database and

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,280
then ripped this to a website so now in

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,640
the state of Nebraska if you happen to

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,090
live there you can see the tip has

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,410
gotten pretty popular since 1992 by New

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,209
York standards this isn't a lot of money

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,370
but by Nebraska standards this is quite

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,320
a bit of tax money and it gets more and

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,910
more popular every year you can click on

00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,300
your county then you can click on your

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:44,500
city so here's my County through the

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:46,840
county I live in Sarpy County in 2014

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:51,270
you'll notice TIF got a lot more popular

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:54,400
where I live if I click on the city I

00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,610
don't actually live in Gretna I live in

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,290
a sanitary Improvement District so I

00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,300
actually dodged the bullet on this but

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:05,230
if I click on Gretna which is right next

00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:07,780
to my house I can see that in 2014 this

00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,630
thing called the Nebraska crossing smart

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,750
outlet redevelopment kicked in pretty

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,820
hard and I'm like oh that's that strip

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,489
mall between open Omaha and Lincoln on

00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,650
i-80 as you're cruising along there's a

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:21,660
ton of like really high-end retail out

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,990
in the middle of no

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,540
and the Gretna tax base is paying for

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,070
that I'm like wow I'm go ahead I don't

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,550
live in Gretna because I don't shop

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,400
there

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:35,780
so did I want my tax money extra tax

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:41,400
money and develop helping the developers

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:45,900
redevelop this mall here's the details

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:49,290
of it so it was a strip mall but it was

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:53,760
floundering so they leveled it and built

00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:55,560
a strip mall now like I said I don't

00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,480
live in Gretna and if you do live in

00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,970
Gretna maybe this adds a lot of tax base

00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,050
to your city and to your schools and

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,130
stuff I don't know I don't know the

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,600
details but if if I was there I'd be

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:10,650
really interested in this dynamic

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,070
because that's a lot of tax money in

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:16,920
Omaha Omaha is the largest city in

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:19,890
Nebraska and this is very popular and

00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,900
getting more popular so the number one

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,750
thing on here is the first national

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,670
office tower so first National Bank's a

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,140
great Bank i bank there it's the tallest

00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,530
building in the state of Nebraska they

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,330
built this huge shiny

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,610
tallest building you know broke the

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,100
record a few years ago and I love the

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,210
bank but you're looking at the I'm

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,570
looking at this listen I'm like wow

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:46,980
forty million dollars in tax breaks just

00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:48,420
on TIF for a bank downtown building the

00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,150
shiniest building in the state of

00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,830
Nebraska

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,350
that seems odd to me but I don't live in

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,060
Omaha so that's not my tax money so you

00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:01,520
know maybe I don't care about that one

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:04,920
either and maybe this one is now ending

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,780
with three million dollars a year in tax

00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,980
breaks to developers that built those

00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,990
skyscraper seems like a lot of money but

00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,430
no how did we do that so the Department

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,230
of Revenue has all these Excel

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,460
spreadsheets we're going to dump them

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,990
all into sequel light and we're going to

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,940
make a static website so we can just

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:24,180
throw those files out anywhere and just

00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,400
serve them so here's how we did that and

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,080
it's all on github so you can join along

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,770
or check it out or fix bugs or whatever

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,660
you want to do so our bat sequel files

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,340
the schema it's just two tables it's

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,570
just projects and years

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:41,040
refresh schema is a DB IX class or M

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,430
which is kind of handy to have laying

00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,790
around

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,650
so use the DB IX class schema loader to

00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,420
create the ORM so now you just have one

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,480
liners to IAO the database if you want

00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,850
to and then load DB is the thing that

00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,120
actually reads from the Excel

00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,740
spreadsheets and loads the database up

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,210
really simple stuff except the

00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,370
normalization gets a little bit tricky

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:06,480
because each of these tax years in the

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:10,260
Excel spreadsheet says things about ten

00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:14,160
years of history right so the 2016 file

00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:17,490
says things about 2006 through 2016 the

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,040
2015 file says things about 2005 through

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:24,540
2015 you would think that both of those

00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:27,240
files would agree on 2013 data they do

00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,190
not so silly me when I wrote the program

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,050
I was like oh hey we're just going to

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,570
die we're going to blow up if we see

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,100
something that was not what the previous

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:38,670
file said because you would think that

00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,350
they would know 2012 data by like 2014

00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,050
surely that's set in stone but it's not

00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:45,930
so there's a lot of warnings etc the

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,880
normalization of the data is the most

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,260
interesting part and then the

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,420
communication with the Department of

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,750
Revenue's saying health what's what's

00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,390
happening like why and why in 2014 was

00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:00,570
2009 this none in 2015 in 2009 was

00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:02,880
different that was interesting so anyway

00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:06,210
once we got it in sequel light we can

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,830
just generate WW using a couple of

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,810
toolkit and spit out the entire static

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,810
website that we saw earlier so that

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:15,170
works out pretty good the simplest

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,970
possible software that could do our goal

00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,410
thrown into Twitter bootstrap just so

00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:23,070
hopefully it works on mobile devices and

00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,770
stuff so we get this little website you

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,580
can hover over it and see different

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,770
different amounts in the red and the

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:33,450
green and all this stuff it's pretty

00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:34,710
slick okay so say you have access to a

00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,870
spherical tip say you live in Nebraska

00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:39,000
now I wrote this TIF report for you and

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,540
you have access then from it you live in

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,890
Gretna let's say

00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:47,440
and you you now know and are super

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,110
pleased or super displeased about one of

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,610
the things what do you do about that

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:57,550
well in this various wildly in the City

00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:59,410
of Omaha to the Omaha City Council that

00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,960
decides all these things discusses all

00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:05,950
things things and I've heard that City

00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:08,170
Council based decision making is popular

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,810
but it might vary it might be staid it

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,460
might be local it might be subdivisions

00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,680
it could be Platts it could be whatever

00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:19,120
right so you'd have to check locally and

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,530
see what's going on in our case the

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,660
Omaha City Council makes all these this

00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:25,120
is well in Omaha's case again I live in

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:30,900
a cemetery / district I don't pay taxes

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:34,440
towards TIF but in Omaha's case we get

00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:38,200
40 PDS like this every year

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:45,010
this one's 38 pages long the meeting

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:46,840
starts the page 27 item 60 they're like

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,610
oh hey and we're making a decision or an

00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,620
announcement or a pre decision or a pre

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,150
announcements or we've changed our minds

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,300
or whatever about tax increment

00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:58,240
financing so the policy walks you are

00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,090
wanting to hold city mount City Council

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,570
members accountable for their votes on

00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:06,160
these things thank you

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:09,910
they really want this information like

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:14,350
they want to see specifically item 60 on

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:16,000
page 27 of this specific file but they

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,130
want to go all the way back to 1992

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,210
and now they're looking at a hundred

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:23,950
hours of PDF you know ctrl F all right

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,400
so we thought it might be kind of

00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:33,040
helpful to take these 362 PDF again with

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:34,540
all open-source 360 to PDF files run

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,610
them through a text converter and then

00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:40,900
use Perl to convert it into markdown if

00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:43,960
it's Tiff's relevance based on a really

00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,960
cheesy red X right that I've adjusted 15

00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,410
times because there's exceptions and

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,410
whatever

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,189
so I wrote this stuff and hopefully it's

00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:58,220
helpful to people who are brave enough

00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:59,809
to try to dive through massive PDF

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,019
archives and go to lots of City Council

00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:04,730
meeting it generates markdown that kind

00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:06,559
of looks like this there's one markdown

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,360
file per year and all it did was pluck

00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,600
out item 60 and say hey that might be a

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,220
relevant item 60 on that date and this

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,990
this stuff is all committed to github

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:19,420
food so hopefully that helps people

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:23,929
other cool things we could do with this

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:26,660
like if there's discrepancies and the

00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:29,480
voting records in the City Council

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,769
minutes about if that would be

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,160
interesting most of these things are

00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:36,139
unanimous and text votes are extremely

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,600
boring and unless unless the citizen

00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:41,029
steps up and you know really fights one

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,679
of them these things seem to be rubber

00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:44,600
stamped but you know maybe that's not

00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:48,910
fair maybe that's not at all accurate

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:52,970
so that those are what it appears to be

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:54,559
if we get the voting records of who the

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,610
City Council members who voted for the

00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:57,439
tips that'd be kind of cool

00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,360
in a database maybe how do we pull that

00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:03,790
out like natural language processing of

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,790
that PDF and then its file I don't know

00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:08,720
sometimes it's too late by the time you

00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:10,399
you say wait what you're going to give

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,290
eight million dollars to this thing

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:17,480
that's ridiculous I don't need another

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:20,269
baseball stadium maybe public alerts

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,509
would be great like maybe knowing that

00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:25,309
the agenda item said that this was for

00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,990
consideration in two meetings or

00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:29,629
whatever that that could alert people

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:32,449
who care that'd be cool easy to

00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:36,970
understand project summaries of the plat

00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:36,970
descriptions well we'll get to that

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,410
discuss some things let you use your

00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,449
Facebook account to argue about stuff on

00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,040
the internet and arguing on the Internet

00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:48,860
is the most productive thing ever right

00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,449
so maybe we add that but I'm not I don't

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,970
want to be the one who's moderating and

00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:55,160
we probably have to moderate it and then

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:58,910
geolocation well geolocation gets really

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:01,399
interesting because the data is legal

00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,300
descriptions and I'm no lawyer but I

00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,700
can't for the

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:11,360
they understand a lot of legal

00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:13,640
descriptions of property so how do you

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,290
pull GPS lat/long out of this stuff and

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,720
put a big map big Google map when the

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,820
beacon slick

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:24,350
yeah so I had one volunteer for two

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:30,890
hours and they quit if it's even

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:33,050
accurate right you know yeah so I did

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:35,420
all that for Nebraska Vermont hey

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,800
they've got a thing with actual api's

00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,010
and you can download spreadsheets and

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,930
stuff like this is an actual data

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:44,030
repository kind of something are there I

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,370
haven't played with this yet but I saw

00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:48,290
it just googling and I was like oh wow

00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:50,780
that's cool maybe we should move towards

00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:56,570
a much more dynamic API driven kind of

00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:59,080
deal so what I would ask is what is the

00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,580
fifth information in where you live

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,150
because I registered this demand shift

00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:07,880
out report and I have a sliver of pride

00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:10,190
about Nebraska that if that report but

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,700
if you know if you live in New York New

00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,810
York and you want NY NY dot v dot report

00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,340
that'd be great

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:20,540
I would love to delegate those domains

00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:22,100
to you and let's figure it out is it

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,920
possible that stuff could be aggregated

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,140
I have no idea until we know even where

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,910
the data is I don't know how you would

00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:35,420
go about aggregating but that Priestly

00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:39,860
so yeah any questions do I have two

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:41,930
minutes I have five minutes Oh awesome

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:54,100
we've done this one those are my slides

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:54,100
all right any questions yeah

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,690
like I did

00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:14,240
that's one problem yeah what I did was

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,250
all PDFs to text the biggest problem of

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,440
the PDFs is they say click here to see

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,690
attachment and then they change file

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,899
servers over the years so three years

00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,190
ago click here no longer resolves so you

00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:26,540
can't see that attachment even if you

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,130
wanted to and this is assuming you're in

00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:32,080
they say you're a human that really is

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:34,520
interested in this specific project but

00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,339
yeah that all I'm doing is text

00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,980
conversion for for the minutes the for

00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:47,350
the data Excel for the the dollar

00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:56,330
figures I just stream mode PDF sucks

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:57,980
yeah not too bad and they even changed a

00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,020
couple of them for me like when they

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,779
when they change stuff around it was

00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,310
incompatible I would just email them and

00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:06,350
ask them did you know that you did this

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,390
and they're like oh you need to update

00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,010
your Microsoft Excel and I'm like I

00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:12,200
don't I'm not using my I'm using

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,700
OpenOffice or whatever and a couple

00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,709
times they changed it in a couple but

00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,630
they are very responsive there to the

00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:19,670
the credit of the property assessment

00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,290
division Nebraska Department of Revenue

00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,660
they were very responsive to that it

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:28,089
wasn't too bad so the program had to

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,089
kind of shuffle but not to that yeah

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:38,360
because they were wrong and now they're

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:42,370
right they yeah they were fixing the the

00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,370
data was wrong yeah so

00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:50,670
yeah like their religion so the sir I

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,380
should be repeating concussion so the

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:56,190
question was didi overwrite the bad data

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:58,380
with the new data originally my program

00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,399
explodes and then I go to the policy

00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,720
wonk guy and I'm like what do we do

00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,880
about this and you like I just throw a

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,400
warning so it's there on 2000 mornings

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,660
and then it turned into okay we're just

00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,760
going to take whatever they most

00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,589
recently said about that thing and just

00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,120
assume that it's right so I still have a

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,550
log like if you go into the drop box of

00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,020
the program that runs there's a log of

00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,250
all the warnings this is all the times

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,980
they change their minds about a specific

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,980
data point but it just overrides yeah

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,400
only like with my eyeballs on like 20

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,870
data points I was like ah because

00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,090
sometimes it's just a better description

00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,440
which is great like sometimes I just go

00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,750
in there and they just say okay well

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,550
we're going to be more informative in

00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,620
the description there were a couple

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,540
descriptions of change I was like that

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:46,050
seems to be changing the nature of the

00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:48,690
TIF was that it was on purpose

00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,490
I don't know and then the dollar figures

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,690
I don't know why you know so Hanuman if

00:17:50,490 --> 00:18:00,000
there are conspiracies there I'm not

00:17:51,690 --> 00:18:02,070
aware of them yet the report in the

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,929
Dropbox if you just look at the report

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,630
on the Dropbox it tells you what changed

00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:09,030
and when it changed and you know I

00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:13,070
pointed them to that and I said hey and

00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:17,510
they're like oh yeah we took stuff so

00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:25,970
yeah oh yeah I think I'm over now so

00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:25,970
