	I wrote a thing: The Nebraska TIF Report: http://nebraska.tif.report/

Tax Increment Financing (TIF) is one of those dry, abstract governmental issues that has powerful effects on how we live. TIF was originally conceived to promote economic development in marginalized areas. But is YOUR tax money supporting projects like low-income housing, homeless shelters, and drug rehabilitation clinics? Or are YOUR tax dollars being spent on kickbacks to developers of high income apartments and condos?

I live in Nebraska. I'll show you how we took years of Excel spreadsheets and normalized the data into an SQLite database, and then generated a static website which we hope will help people decide whether or not they're happy with how their tax dollars are being spent.

Maybe you can shine a light on TIF where you live?
