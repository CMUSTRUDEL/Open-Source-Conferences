okay so I'm going to tell you how you

00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,440
can build your own peace of mind and

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,850
actually this is not your peace of mind

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,470
this is my peace of mind so you can

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:13,320
build your own but you have different

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,759
needs I live here and every time I get

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,580
here I can't remember if I close my

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:23,609
garage door alright well I can check it

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,350
and control it remotely right there are

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,090
some vendor specific solutions like

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,429
craftsman and some of the other

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,560
Chamberlain they make their own but you

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,239
know you have to have a fairly new

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,250
garage door opener and you have to use

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,320
their vendor hosted solution which I'm

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,700
getting more privacy conscious but you

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,410
know I'm more worried that they're going

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,300
to just take the service away one day

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,800
and then your expensive fancy garage

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,829
door opener is just a box that hangs off

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,809
the side of your car and there's one

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,180
other option that I found that isn't

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,379
online but it will like time it and if

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,789
it's been open for too long it will

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,039
close yourself and that would have

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,230
almost worked except it's really loud it

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,960
like makes this horrible like wailing

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,559
sound I don't know it's so I'm going to

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,820
build my own

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,830
I got myself a Raspberry Pi you need you

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,060
know a power supply and a micro SD card

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,500
they don't always tell you that you need

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,510
these things but you do

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,619
I found a blog post that tells you how

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,180
to D inclin'd eyes it which it's called

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,290
Americanizing it really is just how you

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,460
go through and change all the locale

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,990
settings but you'll want to do that

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,830
because it really thinks it's from

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,509
England I bought myself an infrared

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,939
proximity sensor I think was like seven

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,130
bucks it's kind of cool it's got a light

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,240
emitting yeah got a light emitting

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,439
source on one side and a light

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,509
collecting source on the other side and

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,220
bring anything close enough to it'll see

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,110
the reflected light and I'll say ah

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,840
there's something there and it changes

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,119
the output voltage I had a laying around

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,560
transistor from some old project that I

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,149
had and it turned out it worked well

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,280
enough the transistor is basically just

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,049
a switch that if you apply some current

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,509
to it it will let other current go

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,740
through and that's basically all your

00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:00,270
button does when you press your garage

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:02,219
door right so start with those there's a

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,490
really cool mountable prototype board

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:08,090
from Adafruit this will sit on top of

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,610
the Raspberry Pi but something you can

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,470
solder to and I needed a few other

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,770
things the the most important of which

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,350
is

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,790
if you saw on that detector it had three

00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:23,160
wires so I was going to use what's the

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,840
speaker wire but speaker wire only has

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,040
two leads and this thing has three leads

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,740
so how am I going to get all the way to

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,300
the side of my garage door old telephone

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:36,900
wire which you guys don't need anymore

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:38,910
anyway so so this is the board partially

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,500
assembled you can see how the little

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,240
board sits on top of the Raspberry Pi

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,860
and you can solder onto that when it's

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,690
off obviously and that got me into the

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,570
more the software side of this well I

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,980
want to have two images but I'm not very

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,420
good at drawing things I have no idea

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,760
what I'm doing so I wouldn't do an SVG

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,850
editor I used Inkscape I drew two layers

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,480
on the same image it's a door and a car

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:05,010
that's behind the door and the nice

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,990
thing about it is I know just enough web

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,020
frontend to say ah with the CSS

00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:12,630
transition I can move an SVG image one

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,640
on top of the other if you do it more or

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,140
less like this here's a demonstration

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,930
this isn't you know connected to my

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,180
garage but if I mouse over it you see

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,510
how the transition works it's kind of

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,010
cool

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,860
I mean it's ugly but I'm not good at

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,470
this but it doesn't matter cuz it tells

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,270
me if it worked so I wrote of course I'm

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,860
Oh delicious web app I'm involved in mo

00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,020
delicious if you need any help with mojo

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,730
please come talk to me it has a little

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,950
API that just tells me basically the

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,510
garage door open or not and then another

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,450
one that lets me open or close it and

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,400
then it pulls the back end poles for the

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,900
door state once a second and shoves it

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,970
to me on the web socket as long as I'm

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,200
connected it's not too bad it's only me

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,200
this wouldn't scale but who cares

00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,540
importantly clicking the door your first

00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,010
thought is going to be out when I click

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,930
the door I'm already in JavaScript so I

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,330
just moved the door right no you want to

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,290
know when the door moved so don't

00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,760
connect your JavaScript action to the

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,739
reporting state you want the reporting

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,600
state to only come from the polar a

00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:17,340
quick word provide security if your

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,160
house is like my house this is a door to

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:25,040
your house and you've just put it online

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,040
so do think about that a little bit

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:33,680
and now if everything works hello

00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:38,240
Carolyn are you there

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:43,730
she's supposed to be turn your camera on

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:46,350
no wait

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:53,180
why are we in the house or garage - it's

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:56,580
not in the house oh there she goes okay

00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:01,430
down there because I'm showing you that

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,430
I can't show you this here Oh God

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,089
[Applause]

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,019
[Applause]

00:05:30,219 --> 00:05:35,230
it should fun up okay almost always live

00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:38,339
demo work

00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,339
[Applause]

00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,190
