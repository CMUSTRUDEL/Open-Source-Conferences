Title: Doug Bell - Web Dev: Generations
Publication date: 2020-06-24
Playlist: TPC 2020 in the Cloud
Description: 
	This talk will show the most important new developments in web dev, the history of these technologies, how and why they've been improved, current best practices, and things to watch for in the future. Emphasis will be on features usable today on any website without complex development frameworks.

Are you struggling to stay up-to-date with the state of web development? Are you interested in why the web sites you maintain are using tables everywhere? Would you like to know some of the wonderful things that have been created in the last 30 years to make web development easier?

In this talk, Doug Bell will show the most important new developments in web technologies. In addition, he’ll explore the history of those technologies, how they’ve been improved, current best practices, and things to watch for in the future.

If you’re a former web developer looking to see what’s new, or a current web developer looking to see how we got here, this talk is for you. Emphasis will be on features usable today on any website without complex development frameworks. Some experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be helpful to understand the example code.

all right that to think looks good it's

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,070
not showing me what it's showing me sir

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,750
what's it showing you guys so well the

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:21,539
whole bit looks good yeah yep that's

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:22,350
good all right so and this one is not

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:29,559
showing me my doubts

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:29,559
[Music]

00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:45,090
yeah well that was actually probably the

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,010
most benign problem that could happen so

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:54,329
we'll just wait until a better one

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:59,820
happens so the world wide web was

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:02,250
invented in 1990 and I was seven

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,000
yeah I was seven definitely more

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:09,830
interested in transformers so it's been

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,860
30 years an eternity in technology time

00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:21,659
the web's an adult now and in a lot a

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:26,610
lot of change from this this here is the

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:29,220
very first website reproduced in 92 and

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,979
it's perfect no distractions from the

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,400
content that's very easy to read easy to

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,329
analyze

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,090
I got no images no pesky JavaScript

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,250
trying to pop up windows and

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:44,430
advertisements and no under-construction

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,130
gifts which well I guess we can't have

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:51,360
everything

00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:56,430
and then the first big event in the web

00:01:51,360 --> 00:02:01,469
came in 94 and that opened up the world

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,840
wide web to the well world was the

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,560
release of mosaic which was one of the

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,869
first widely used well among the people

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,950
on the web at the time graphical

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:16,319
browsers so you can see here now

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,580
I've got a web page and it has an image

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,520
on it

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,580
so now we can use the web for its

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:29,640
intended and only purpose sharing cat

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:33,209
pictures but unfortunately time marches

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:37,260
on a few years later we had the release

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:44,010
of version 4 of both Internet Explorer

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:48,090
and Netscape Navigator and this is what

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:51,150
started off a it started looking almost

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:54,840
kind of like a modern web a modern web

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:59,150
site these are the first browsers with

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,470
any kind of recognizable modern features

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,200
but this was also the start of the

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,110
infamous browser wars in which many

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,600
people lost their lives each vendor

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:13,350
trying to make their browser the one

00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:16,610
browser to rule them all and to get

00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:20,609
users to their browser they would build

00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:23,820
extensions to websites that only worked

00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:26,370
in their browser if you're old enough

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:32,010
you may recall this site is best viewed

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:35,000
in Internet Explorer version 5 so after

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:39,030
they laid waste too much of my sanity

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,390
from the ashes of the lawsuits rose a

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,269
push for Standardization and the

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:51,660
standards then are the blueprints that

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:54,720
allow us to build the modern web so I've

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,510
now reached the year 2000 the new

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,549
millennium and I've still got 20 years

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:04,380
to go here so our history lesson is

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:08,220
going to get split up here into a couple

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,950
different topics first I'm going to talk

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,459
about web design which is how we present

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:17,729
web content and then I'm going to talk

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,729
about web apps which is how we use the

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:23,900
web interactively seeing it's not as a

00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:26,939
not a read-only medium

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:31,250
so starting with design let's look again

00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:34,620
back at that first that first webpage

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:38,939
elegance in its simplicity we've got our

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:44,039
content we can link to other content we

00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:47,210
can use some headings too and add some

00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:47,210
lists to organize our content

00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:56,050
folks had this crazy kind of idea they

00:04:52,390 --> 00:05:01,690
wanted to put lots of text side-by-side

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:05,020
like some sort of like newspaper and as

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,990
screen resolutions increased at this

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:11,440
time we almost had a photorealistic 1024

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:16,330
by 768 the longer lines of text became

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:19,810
harder and harder to read so in 1995 we

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:22,150
got the HTML table element which allows

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,360
for tables of data you know like Excel

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:29,020
spreadsheets but when Netscape

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,440
implemented it they allowed you to set

00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:36,250
borders to 0 to set the spacing between

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:40,120
cells to 0 and the padding in a Cell to

00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:45,580
0 so our table that once looked like

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:50,020
this could be able to look like this and

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:56,550
from here we have a very very basic tool

00:05:50,020 --> 00:06:00,670
for laying out parts of a web page and

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:05,140
it was ok I can make better body side

00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:09,730
bar footer very classic now web page

00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:13,360
layout but there were some issues to

00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:16,870
deal with first and foremost this kind

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,940
of layout is a lot of work you've got a

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,010
range all of your content in rows and

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:24,070
columns

00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:25,900
everything other than content is going

00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,790
to have to be an image so we've got

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,220
images for borders images for

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:36,460
backgrounds images for circles round

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:39,430
borders everything and if the image

00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,290
doesn't fit where you want it you ended

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:46,390
up having to slice it to fit into each

00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:48,010
table cell there were indeed programs

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:51,550
that would do this for you

00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:55,960
Adobe Photoshop could slice up an image

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:59,169
for an HTML table that's how often we

00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,490
had to do this kind of thing which led

00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:04,410
to our second problem here tables aren't

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,979
meant for this they went to display

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:10,800
content so the browsers would try to

00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:15,090
resize table cells to fit the content

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,090
inside them which well ends up breaking

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:21,210
your design so you fix that by setting

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,949
widths for every single cell and then

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,470
you figure out that the browser ignores

00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:29,910
that when it feels like it so you start

00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:31,560
adding single invisible pixel images to

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,710
make sure that there's some content in

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,080
those cells to keep them open and keep

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,639
everything exactly the way you want it

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:45,620
so that the browser doesn't go and

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,620
resize it and if that wasn't enough we

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:53,690
have our pages shell but what if we want

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:57,599
columns then in our body section well

00:07:53,690 --> 00:08:02,430
the solution then is more tables and

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:04,860
more tables is a lot more work so for

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,599
example here I've got this you know

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,530
pretty simple website looks pretty

00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,150
innocent simple clean this is what it

00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:17,449
looks like with every single element

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:21,240
outlined there everywhere there's a good

00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:25,530
200 yeah 100 elements probably on this

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:28,139
simple page here is the code for that

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:32,010
that's how small I had to make that for

00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:34,649
this to fit on this slide you can see

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:38,579
all the blank space there so much of

00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:44,450
this is just setting up rows and columns

00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:44,450
and not as much is the actual content

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:53,670
so tables are complex tables are slow my

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:56,490
tables are hard to maintain so no matter

00:08:53,670 --> 00:09:00,090
what anyone tells you these were not the

00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:04,110
good old days no matter what anybody who

00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:09,270
hates CSS or whatever these these were

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:14,490
not good old days I much prefer now so

00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:16,760
let's skip ahead then to 2002 CSS has

00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,590
been around for a few years now but

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,740
support for it is finally good enough

00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:26,970
that we can start using it so this would

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,530
be I II six Netscape seven and we can

00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,520
start using one of it's one of its main

00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:35,790
features which are called floats now

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:39,660
these were designed to be able to float

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:41,550
our cat pictures around some text you

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,970
can see how the the bottom paragraph

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:48,060
there flows underneath that image and

00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:51,840
before CSS we did that well within a

00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:56,160
lion attribute on the image itself but

00:09:51,840 --> 00:10:00,620
in CSS you can float anything even just

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,620
plain pieces of content

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,970
so here again we have the makings of a

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,970
basic kind of layout

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:16,420
floats are awkward again this really

00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:18,339
isn't meant to do layouts they have a

00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,139
lot of special rules that take some

00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:21,760
getting used to

00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:24,970
first and foremost they're allowed to

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,310
overflow so you can see here my cat

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:29,010
picture is outside of my paragraph and

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:34,630
then if I try to add another paragraph

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:38,680
well that doesn't really look right and

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:41,170
this will break your layout so to fix

00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,410
this you're gonna have to add this clear

00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:46,720
property to make the next element skip

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:50,440
past any floats so you can see now it's

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,079
doing approximately what I wanted but

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,600
often to clear these things I have to

00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:57,940
add more markup that's just purpose is

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,050
just to make sure that the next thing

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:04,870
starts on the next line another kind of

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:08,110
weird quirk is that in these float based

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:12,070
layouts the element the order of the

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,980
elements in the markup matters and often

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:18,670
it's not the natural order of reading

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:22,899
you know top to bottom left to right so

00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:25,420
for example here what I did wrong was I

00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:29,350
have these three elements in the in the

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:32,829
order left center right the left one

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:36,010
here is floated left and the right one

00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:40,870
is floated right and this seems natural

00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:42,190
illogical but this is the result to fix

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,519
this what I actually have to do is I

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:47,139
have to put the right column before the

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:53,759
center column

00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:58,559
so it's kind of weird kind of unnatural

00:11:53,759 --> 00:12:01,059
and it takes getting used to

00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,540
speaking of the center there is no

00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:06,249
center there is no way to float Center

00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,379
if you want to Center you're gonna have

00:12:06,249 --> 00:12:12,549
to wrap your floats in a container which

00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:15,759
is even more markup and at that point we

00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:19,419
might as well just use tables so despite

00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:22,869
all this and a website was invented

00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:27,069
called the CSS Zen garden and its goal

00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:30,189
was to give you the markup and you

00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:32,829
create a CSS file to change it to make

00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:36,669
it look however you want and there were

00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:42,129
some wild things that you can do just by

00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:45,579
changing the CSS of a page one such

00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:52,439
example here is this so this is the

00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:57,360
exact same page but with different CSS

00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:57,360
and I close my speaker view here so

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:05,439
because it doesn't play there we go so

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:09,369
the same CSS our sorry a different CSS

00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:10,589
the same HTML it looks completely

00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:14,709
different

00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:18,970
so this CSS Zen garden indeed is one of

00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:22,799
the sites that really popularized using

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,799
CSS and going away from tables

00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:32,589
so all these quirks ended up resulting

00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:35,529
in a bunch of patterns and in 2008 these

00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:39,239
patterns kind of became formalized into

00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:39,239
what became the twelve column grid

00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:44,619
largely it was twelve columns because 12

00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:45,850
is a nice even number that's readily

00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:48,189
divisible by a whole bunch of other

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,749
numbers so you can see here there's a

00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:55,689
lot of different ways we can take twelve

00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:57,279
columns and and mix them up and so um so

00:13:55,689 --> 00:14:00,060
we took this this kind of this grid

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:05,019
framework this grid library

00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:09,490
and it was pretty good um we didn't

00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:11,620
think about it too much but it's still a

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,290
bunch of extra markup at this point

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,829
we're now still doing our rows and

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,480
columns our rows can or our columns can

00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:24,120
contain other rows and we don't tell

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:28,540
like nest things so badly but the real

00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:31,360
kind of nail in the coffin of this float

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:38,730
based layouts was the beginning of the

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:41,470
mobile web starting in mid late 2000s

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:44,560
the problem with this float layout here

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:47,320
is that it's kind of a fixed grid we

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,070
have to set the widths of all of these

00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,589
columns precisely and that's not

00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:57,640
responsive for a very very small screen

00:14:53,589 --> 00:15:00,279
like we've got on our phone so the first

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:03,459
thing we tried to do to fix this is we'd

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:05,290
create a mobile site so if a phone tried

00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:07,540
to hit our website we'd redirect it to a

00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,600
different site so we'd maintain two

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:16,180
websites and often they were the same

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:20,260
sometimes they were less so and often we

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:22,990
also I'd be on my desktop and I'd get to

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:29,350
the mobile Wikipedia which never worked

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:35,829
out very well so to solve this one in

00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:38,800
2009 we had media queries which allowed

00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:40,329
us to apply different kinds of CSS based

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,070
on the device that was viewing this the

00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:49,209
web page so for example normally I could

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:50,949
have 12 columns but then perhaps when

00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:53,800
it's not a tablet there's only four

00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:57,940
columns and when it's on a phone there's

00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:01,630
only one column and so we do this

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:04,390
through breakpoints so for example here

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:08,320
all of the CSS in those curly braces

00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:12,810
will be applied only until the browser

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,810
is 450 pixels wide

00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,399
and then I can have another set of rules

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:20,920
for 451 pixels to ten hundred twenty

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:25,080
four pixels and I can have another set

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:28,330
of rules for anything larger than 1024

00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:30,670
so I can get my phone my tablets and my

00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:33,730
desktop each having kind of their own

00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:36,070
style sheets and remember from the CSS

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:40,420
Zen garden that using a style sheet I

00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:44,860
can make any change I want provided my

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:48,010
markup is well designed but this isn't

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:52,510
fluid this is like a set of breakpoints

00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:54,970
so like what happens if there's a I

00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:57,640
don't know what browser that's 600

00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:00,310
pixels it doesn't like doesn't look very

00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,080
good on what do I do that well I had

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:06,100
more breakpoints and more breakpoints

00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,990
and more breakpoints and unfortunately

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,569
we're still using floats so the order of

00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:14,620
the markup still matters so I am still

00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:16,360
rearranging markup to make sure that the

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:22,240
right ones are seen in the right order

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:25,569
and this all became solved it's all got

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:29,950
solved finally in 2015 we're now getting

00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:35,470
quite quite recent with the flexible box

00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:37,120
model so flex box allows us to put

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:40,980
elements side-by-side

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,980
much like floats and tables did

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,760
it also lets us grow and shrink those

00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:50,860
elements based on whatever rules we want

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,800
we can expand and contract the space

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:56,830
between elements we can wrap the

00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,740
elements so they can grow to a certain

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:02,380
size and then start unwrapping

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:06,550
themselves or shrink to a certain size

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:08,410
and then start wrapping and we can align

00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:15,790
the two axes the vertical and horizontal

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:17,650
axes so that it looks like columns so

00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:21,340
this is kind of the first thing that we

00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:26,530
could say is actually fluid we can more

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:30,580
easily take a single page and make it

00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:32,530
look good in any device for any size no

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:37,540
matter what kind of devices are made in

00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:42,340
the future we can resize we can reflow

00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:45,090
and we can even reorder the content flex

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,980
has a feature where we can say that this

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:50,940
third column here should actually be

00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:53,980
shown visually as the second column

00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,500
which is actually quite handy especially

00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:01,890
when you're talking about like moving

00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,890
navigation bars from the side to the top

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:09,110
there

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:13,640
one limitation of flexbox in its that it

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:19,670
is one access so a flexbox goes either

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:23,390
left or right or up and down not both so

00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:26,060
to address this in 2017 we were finally

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:31,970
able support was finally there so that

00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:33,050
we could use the CSS grid which is very

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:36,670
similar to flexbox

00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:40,640
except on two axes but there's a lot of

00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:44,120
complexity here we can arrange elements

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,960
in rows and columns we can assign

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:50,720
elements to named rows and named columns

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,990
so we can name a column like sidebar and

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,390
then any comment that we want to put in

00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,970
our sidebar we just say here put this

00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:00,500
you know assign the sidebar or assign

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,620
this to the header or assign this to the

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:08,480
footer so order becomes even less of a

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:12,980
concern in the markup we can then auto

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:17,650
fit all of our columns and autofill them

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:20,570
so if our screen can support six columns

00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,680
it'll fill six columns if it can only

00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:25,070
support four columns

00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,630
it'll fill four columns and these are

00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:30,560
all settings that you can play around

00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:35,590
with to make sure that you know your

00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:41,110
site looks how you want it so this is

00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:46,580
our first well second truly responsive

00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:50,530
framework for building layouts without

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,530
having to set specific breakpoints

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,330
in our CSS so we don't have to go around

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,120
to various devices figure out how big

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,400
theirs how big their screens are and

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,340
codify that in our CSS that's still

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,480
available if we need to

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,710
unfortunately flexbox and grid aren't

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:15,660
perfect but I have not really found a

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:15,660
need for those recently in in my designs

00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,760
so there is one problem with the grid

00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:25,330
unfortunately it's brand new

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,650
like I said 2017 basic support was

00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:31,050
finally there enough that we could use

00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:33,280
it and so some of the support varies

00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:36,570
there were some things that we're still

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:41,320
kind of up in the air and in flux as

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:42,910
recent as a couple years ago so there's

00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,700
a website out there called can I use

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:48,970
comm where you can type in whatever

00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,820
modern web feature you want and you can

00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:54,340
see which web browsers support that

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:57,580
feature so if you have to support for

00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:01,320
example ie 11 you can type in grid and

00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:06,040
see that oh okay ie 11 does support grid

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:10,000
if you have to support ie8 well I'm

00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:15,460
sorry but you can still type in whatever

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:19,510
you want and see if IEA supports it so

00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:24,190
that's kind of the history and present

00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:27,760
of web design we don't want to use

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:29,140
tables anymore tables are for data we

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,210
definitely don't want to use floats

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:35,110
anymore floats are for flowing text

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:39,970
around things we do want to use flexbox

00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:46,630
and we absolutely if we can want to use

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:49,690
grid the flexbox and grid are really

00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:52,450
really easy I'm actually surprised at

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:55,500
how easy it is now to design web pages

00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:59,740
after doing so many table based layouts

00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:02,040
yes it's just such a such a nice nice

00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,040
feature

00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:10,730
so that's basically all you need to know

00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:14,090
about modern web design so let's talk a

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:19,640
little bit about the interaction the

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:23,570
interactive web so back in the good old

00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:28,400
days we had one way to get user import

00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:32,360
we had a form we had one way to read and

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:36,980
write data that was HTTP so full page

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:41,360
loads we had one way to store data on

00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:44,000
the user's computer cookies which if

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,740
they if they enable them and that's a

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:54,220
whole other brouhaha and if we wanted

00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:58,580
like actual fluid like animated and or

00:23:54,220 --> 00:24:02,840
interesting UI or UX our only option was

00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:07,730
Java or flash in fact Microsoft's front

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:10,160
page used Java for its hover menus and a

00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:13,670
lot of a lot of websites even some that

00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,650
I built ended up using flash just for

00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,420
the menu of the website so that it could

00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,710
look nice when you hover it over because

00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,780
you know that's that's the kind of thing

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,780
that that users actually care about

00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:29,210
it wasn't until 1998 where we were

00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,570
finally able to actually animate HTML

00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:39,140
itself and the browser vendors called

00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:41,270
this dhtml dynamic HTML and this was a

00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:45,290
precursor to what we know today as the

00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:48,500
Dom which means that it wasn't a

00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:50,770
standard as a matter of fact Netscape

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,180
implemented something called a layer tag

00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:56,930
which you accessed from JavaScript

00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:58,880
through the layers attribute ie

00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:02,350
introduced something called a div tag

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,550
which was actually standard at the time

00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:08,420
and then created something called

00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:12,350
document dot all I've still to this day

00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:15,980
see JavaScript looking at document dot

00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:18,370
alt see if they're on IE or not

00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:21,490
but

00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:24,010
that wasn't going to work very well so

00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:29,320
not very much interesting things were

00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:34,410
happening yet until we hit 2002 so in

00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:38,620
2002 we got some very interesting things

00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:39,870
the xml httprequest what you may know

00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:42,880
and it was ajax

00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:50,130
allows you to request data without

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:53,710
reloading the entire page so you could

00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:57,070
finally actually have a essentially a

00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:59,830
single page application you go to the

00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,470
page and then any other updates you need

00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:03,850
to make to that page happen

00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:09,040
asynchronously without reloading the

00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:12,400
whole thing but I think the more

00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:16,780
important one was the document object

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,250
model the Dom at this time in 2002 it's

00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,790
slow it was awkward

00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:26,470
it was verbose it was incompatible but

00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:30,100
it was the start of web standards for

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:34,720
everything there's there's this standard

00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:36,880
way to script a web page that the

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:42,370
browser vendors can't just use whatever

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:44,350
they want and expect things to work I

00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:51,190
for example was never going to write VB

00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:55,210
script for a web page so fast before

00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:58,270
reading a little bit to 2006 we get some

00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:03,630
very interesting things too we finally

00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:03,630
have Jason which means that

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:10,000
javascript object notation it's a much

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:12,259
easier way than XML to transmit data

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,620
which means that now we can finally call

00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:18,710
it Ajax which means asynchronous

00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:22,559
JavaScript and XML despite the fact that

00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:28,570
we only use JSON so

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:30,190
okay but arguably one of the more

00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:34,179
important feature I'm sorry the more

00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:39,340
important development was the jQuery

00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:42,210
library jQuery took all of those

00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:49,470
differences between the browsers and

00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:53,970
just eliminated them the jQuery library

00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:57,429
kind of pushed JavaScript forward

00:27:53,970 --> 00:28:00,820
javascript had been kind of stalled in

00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:03,340
language development since 1990

00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:06,100
something they were trying to build

00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:09,850
classes and types and all sorts of

00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:18,190
things that nobody actually wanted so

00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:22,960
jQuery was what people wanted so a few

00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:27,730
years later we see jquery's features get

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:31,419
supported natively in the browser so

00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:35,710
that's the query selector jQuery is kind

00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:40,030
of most standard feature was the ability

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:43,090
to select JavaScript elements using CSS

00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:45,250
selector syntax which is much much

00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:49,030
easier than looking for those elements

00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:52,690
either just by their ID or worse trying

00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:58,840
to like navigate the Dom tree manually

00:28:52,690 --> 00:29:01,330
just no don't don't try it but so now

00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,850
that same jQuery feature is available to

00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:09,760
us justa natively in the browser no

00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:15,760
library required but another interesting

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:19,500
thing that started the web kind of down

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:23,919
towards more of an application platform

00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:26,440
was local storage so previously we only

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,299
had cookies so we could just a few bytes

00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,059
of data that got passed back and forth

00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:33,850
between the browser and the server so we

00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:36,790
could do logins and that's about it

00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:40,450
maybe remember some preferences

00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:43,330
but local storage allows us to work with

00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:47,470
some persistent storage just as though

00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:51,600
it was a JavaScript object and we could

00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:54,850
set quite a bit of information there and

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,180
better that information never had to be

00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:59,950
sent back to the server like cookies did

00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:04,390
cookies had to be sent back and forth

00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:07,570
every single request so this is kind of

00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:14,050
the start of the browser as an

00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:17,710
application platform which eventually

00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:25,720
started really started really ramping up

00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:29,800
around 2012 which that's not ominous in

00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:33,330
2012 we started having a new a new way a

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:38,170
new set of libraries for responding to

00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:41,170
changes either by the user or we have

00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:44,800
you know Ajax from the requests that

00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:48,340
we're sending called data binding and in

00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:52,630
this what we do is we link data in a

00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:55,420
JavaScript object to a place in the web

00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:59,650
page in the place in the dom and then

00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:03,010
whenever that data changes we rerender

00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:03,940
the dom automatically so for me as the

00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,650
developer

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,640
all I have to do is kind of set up these

00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:14,559
links and then assign to variables and

00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:19,210
the page gets updated so some of the

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:21,160
popular libraries for this are okay my

00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:25,480
coworker just seems to have hit of the

00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:30,540
keyboard here and I no idea what button

00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,540
she pushed ah nope that's not it

00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:43,379
ah try to skip yeah there you go

00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:45,629
well reloading it always works right

00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:48,769
that's that's what we restarted and that

00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:55,590
works and then we restart this and it's

00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:59,610
okay I can see my notes finally so data

00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:03,509
binding then the libraries you've

00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:06,179
probably heard of react angularjs not to

00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:08,970
be confused with angular which is its

00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:11,570
successor but the original angularjs I

00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:15,419
actually used quite a bit and it was

00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:19,559
much much simpler easier to kind of drop

00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:23,399
in to a web page and just use and view

00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:25,860
is definitely the one I recommend now as

00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:29,159
it has the same kind of philosophy as

00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:32,370
angularjs and now you can just drop it

00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:36,269
in a webpage and then pick a spot of

00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:41,820
that webpage to control and have kind of

00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:44,519
a reactive data binding application it

00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:47,720
really really reduces the amount of code

00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:51,840
you have to write to have a dynamic

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:54,679
dynamic section of your website which is

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,679
really really nice

00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:02,150
and then the other thing that we got

00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:05,370
around 2012 was support for web sockets

00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:08,010
so web sockets allows us instead of

00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:11,450
having the browser request something we

00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:13,980
can push out and updates to the browser

00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:17,250
many many technologies had been tried

00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:21,150
for this before I don't remember one of

00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:24,090
them that actually worked I kept hearing

00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:26,610
about the fabled server push there were

00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:29,549
a lot of very weird ways of trying it

00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:33,510
and nothing really worked very well so

00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:36,750
WebSockets have been a very very fun

00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:40,710
thing also well supported by mojolicious

00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:42,900
hint-hint so this is bi-directional

00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:48,030
socket allows us to transfer messages

00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:49,500
back and forth but it's not a TCP socket

00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:52,890
it's this isn't a stream you're not

00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:56,309
going to want to send videos or large

00:33:52,890 --> 00:34:04,020
files through this so we're still gonna

00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:07,470
need HTTP for some things and the last

00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:11,909
thing we kind of got access to was CSS

00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:14,609
animations so previously really the only

00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:18,590
way to animate a web page was either

00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:26,850
tedious JavaScript which kind of slow or

00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:30,590
well flash also kind of slow and CSS

00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:33,090
animations allows for some very fluid

00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:36,419
complex animations but also very simple

00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:41,369
ones this one for example here is a

00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:45,889
simple kind of not go let me replay it a

00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:45,889
simple transform there a transition

00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:54,950
not much to that so we can then also

00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,830
trigger these animations through

00:34:54,950 --> 00:35:01,100
JavaScript so I can set up a fade in and

00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:03,530
out animation and then if I add a class

00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,570
to an element that element fades in or

00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:07,940
that element fades out

00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:11,210
or maybe that element slides in from the

00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:13,070
left or the right as a matter of fact if

00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:16,240
I had transitions enabled in this

00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:21,350
presentation that's that's how it works

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:25,850
so 2012 definitely we're starting to

00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:30,400
look like potentially real exposed by

00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:30,400
real I mean desktop desktop applications

00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:40,140
and finally on our little historical

00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:43,710
journey here 2016 gives us a few

00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:46,289
interesting things the most interesting

00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:52,530
of which is equi script 6 or JavaScript

00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:57,630
6 which is just a massive enhancement of

00:35:52,530 --> 00:36:01,170
the JavaScript language it's got actual

00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:04,680
class syntax which may or may not be

00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:06,900
interesting to you but it has a lot of

00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:10,020
features for decreasing the verbosity of

00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:15,150
your javascript javascript is a lot

00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:16,410
easier to write though perhaps it's a

00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:19,260
bunch of stuff that you have to learn

00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,880
which mmm if only there was some

00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,150
language that had that same problem

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,829
where the longer you work on it the

00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:29,579
shorter the code gets and the harder it

00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:34,650
is to understand I'm sure it'll come to

00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:40,190
me as a pearl of wisdom but there were

00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:43,799
also some other things oops indexdb is

00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:47,089
interesting in that it's just an actual

00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:53,279
database local storage is just an object

00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:55,410
index DB is a schema asynchronous and

00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:59,789
quite complex database right in the

00:36:55,410 --> 00:37:02,789
browser it doesn't use sequel actually

00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:05,160
there was a web sequel attempt and then

00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:08,220
it turned out that everybody used SQLite

00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:11,549
and since there had to be at least two

00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,529
implementations it turned out that

00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:16,829
nobody was actually going to rewrite

00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:21,960
sequel lights so that was scrapped for

00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:25,170
this I don't recommend using index DB

00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,569
directly as mentioned it's complex but

00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,690
there's a library called deck C which is

00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:35,450
quite simple actually

00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:39,150
it's very very nice very easy to use and

00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:43,039
again this kind of allows more more

00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:45,530
local more local information more local

00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,870
work to be done

00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:51,400
a web app as opposed to having

00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:51,400
everything be done on the server

00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:58,880
SVG's are one of my favorite things I

00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:01,850
don't know if they're important enough

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,160
to mention too much about it stands for

00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:07,210
scalable vector graphics which is

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,310
basically it's XML that shows you a

00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:14,500
vector graphic this was actually

00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:20,030
released in 2001 and I had given up hope

00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:21,740
but finally finally in 2016 it's now

00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:24,650
supported enough that I could actually

00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:27,290
use it so you can actually put these

00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:32,510
things right in your web page just type

00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:34,250
it right in and it largely replaces a

00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:41,120
lot of things that we had to use flash

00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:45,350
for previously but also fun thing is you

00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:50,500
can use CSS to style these things so you

00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:54,560
can have SVG's that change on hover

00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:59,210
based on whatever style you want you can

00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,250
create one generic SVG file and then use

00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:03,620
it to create a whole array of different

00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:05,720
colored buttons or stars or

00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:08,830
what-have-you

00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,840
this is a very very useful feature

00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:17,290
charts I know a lot of chart libraries

00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:17,290
are starting to use this excuse me

00:39:17,509 --> 00:39:25,880
and there are some presentation software

00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:28,419
that uses SVG is to try to scale text as

00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,349
big as it can go there are a lot of

00:39:28,419 --> 00:39:32,329
especially with data binding there's

00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:38,210
some interesting things you can do with

00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:42,830
SPG's so

00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:44,240
up next what's something that you should

00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:48,260
be looking at right now maybe that you

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,420
can't use but something that you should

00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:54,320
kind of keep an eye on to see where

00:39:50,420 --> 00:40:00,200
things are going if you just came from

00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:03,950
Graham stock webassembly is finally

00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:07,790
reaching some usable usable places this

00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:12,170
as he described is more like a sandbox

00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:14,720
for user code sir sorry for for code

00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:17,150
which is like exactly what a browser

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,700
needs because I as a user I go to a

00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:23,599
website and that website gets to run

00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:28,640
code on my machine whatever it wants and

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:30,740
so having a sandbox allows us to

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,740
basically protect the user from the

00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:35,750
website author some of you may remember

00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:38,720
the early days of JavaScript where you

00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:42,230
could do very very bad terrible ugly

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,690
things to users like an infinite set of

00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:46,310
alert boxes that would basically the

00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:49,430
only way out would be to restart your

00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:54,080
computer with JavaScript yeah you could

00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:56,980
lock up a computer with JavaScript but

00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:00,260
webassembly is also a compile target so

00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:03,830
you can take I don't know C code

00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:05,900
compiler webassembly uh mmm Perl code

00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:09,200
compile it to webassembly I can finally

00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:13,330
again write Perl script I haven't been

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,330
able to write Perl script since ie three

00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:21,920
WebRTC is new one very interesting

00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:26,060
there's an IRC client project called

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,130
convos that has added WebRTC supports

00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:31,160
and what this stands for is real-time

00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:35,000
communication and what's this lets us do

00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:41,869
is this this nice zoom sharing video

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:44,300
audio stuff but over the web so through

00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:48,440
a browser anybody can do it we don't

00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:52,180
need to install more software and we

00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,180
don't need to know who we can trust

00:41:53,490 --> 00:42:01,200
but one of the more interesting things

00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:04,290
that's really just on the cusp is it's

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,770
called service workers and that doesn't

00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:10,530
really describe what does one of the

00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:13,170
things that service workers do is so

00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:16,020
it's another process essentially that

00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:19,620
runs JavaScript kind of outside of your

00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:24,360
website it doesn't have a web page but

00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:28,370
allows you to do synchronizations kind

00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:31,770
of offline but it also allows you to

00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:35,730
when the browser is offline handle

00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:39,630
requests from it so say for example your

00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:41,250
our phone you've got you know some notes

00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:43,470
app then you've got open in a web in a

00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:48,090
web browser and you're going through a

00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:50,910
tunnel on the train every time you lose

00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:53,640
connection to the Internet your service

00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:57,060
worker can be handling those changes and

00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,590
queuing them up caching them waiting for

00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,260
the next time that you get Internet

00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:05,190
connectivity and then send all of those

00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:07,170
changes to the server so to the user it

00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:08,940
doesn't look like anything's changed the

00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:13,170
the requests are still being responded

00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:16,140
to but they aren't being responded to by

00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:21,420
a server they're being responded to by

00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:24,840
your service worker so this these and

00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:27,530
other things are kind of the start of

00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:32,280
what's called a progressive web app

00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:35,820
which is less web and more app it's kind

00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,920
of blurring a line here I like to think

00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:41,600
of it kind of as a web native app like

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,430
you go to a website and you have an app

00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,620
there's ways to install these things now

00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:49,290
you go to a website it'll pop up a hey

00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:53,520
install this on your home page for your

00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:54,900
home screen there we go so there's a lot

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,380
of

00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:02,160
I didn't cover but some just some things

00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:04,920
to kind of take a look at there's now a

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,680
browser API for websites to handle open

00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,320
with URLs so for example if you want

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,880
Gmail to open up mail links when you

00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:16,380
click on mail link it'll open your

00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:19,530
browser and Gmail notifications

00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:21,150
that's actually really fun I I built a

00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:25,280
web web app just a couple days ago to

00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:28,410
notify me when overnight loads are done

00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:32,369
and if they just they show up in my in

00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:34,140
my native notification area off office

00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,460
fund your browser is your account I

00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,350
don't have to use Twitter as an account

00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,000
I don't use Facebook as an account but

00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:41,310
if you use Google as an account my

00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,890
browser is my account

00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:47,550
same thing with payments just direct

00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:51,300
from my browser to the website GPU

00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:54,900
access WebGL was a thing but now they're

00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:58,050
going different WebGL didn't really

00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:00,300
catch on very much and yeah 3d graphics

00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:06,600
may be more of a niche than I'm thinking

00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:09,840
of but speech is actually getting pretty

00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,010
interesting these days not only speech

00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:16,880
input but also speech output

00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:19,320
text-to-speech and VR and AR are just

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,790
now I don't know if they're wrapping up

00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:25,500
steam again

00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:28,740
VRML is old but they're doing new things

00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,000
and maybe maybe it'll work this time I

00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:35,690
don't know that's what they said about

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:41,840
3d TVs I guess there's some other things

00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:45,090
the web accessibility interface or Aria

00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:47,190
we can have fonts now so you can put a

00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:50,460
font in your web page and it will

00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:52,140
download it to the user automatically so

00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,780
we don't have to just use web dings or

00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:56,670
Comic Sans we can make absolutely sure

00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:00,300
that they have Comic Sans when we want

00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:03,780
them to but also there are fonts now

00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:07,079
that just consists of icons and those

00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:09,299
are really nice for building you eyes I

00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:11,249
have rounded borders I don't use images

00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:15,119
for that but I can also have layered

00:46:11,249 --> 00:46:16,619
backgrounds so if I have you know I want

00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,630
one thing up in this corner and one

00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:20,190
thing up in the bottom corner I don't

00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,690
need to have two different elements I

00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:26,009
can just put two backgrounds on the same

00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:30,119
island and indeed CSS can make up images

00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:34,549
like gradients and it can alter images

00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:36,839
you can filter them transform them etc

00:46:34,549 --> 00:46:40,759
one more interesting things that I wish

00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:45,119
I wish I knew more about is web metadata

00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:48,390
in that you can annotate your website

00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:50,430
and say that this element describes a

00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:54,239
person's name this element describes a

00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:58,529
person's address and then search engines

00:46:54,239 --> 00:47:01,729
especially can use this to display kind

00:46:58,529 --> 00:47:08,099
of a preview of this content or Facebook

00:47:01,729 --> 00:47:10,289
Twitter they did this thing too so that

00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:14,849
is what essentially the last 30 years

00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:16,890
have brought it's just so many new

00:47:14,849 --> 00:47:20,390
possibilities and so many new

00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:24,509
possibilities coming just a little while

00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:28,380
and I honestly I've had such fun doing

00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:31,579
this and I can only wait to see what

00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:35,160
happens next

00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:38,479
so does anybody have any questions we've

00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,479
got a couple minutes here

00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:47,450
you can either raise your hand or you

00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:56,710
can just unmute and ask it's either way

00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:56,710
it's fine I'm cher Oh suck sure

00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,880
okay there we go

00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:15,980
I don't have a question I just want to

00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:19,580
say that was an excellent summary I'm

00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:21,680
not a wet web guy but yeah I remember

00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:26,540
lots of this stuff that you were talking

00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:28,250
about oh yeah good very good son yeah I

00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,320
was I was surprised after I wrote that

00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:32,090
that first section and then I looked at

00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:36,350
where I was in the time line it was oh

00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:48,260
oh oh the new millennium I haven't even

00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:51,790
graduated high school yet why are you

00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,790
gonna continue to have co-presenters

00:48:52,750 --> 00:49:01,700
sorry oh you're gonna compete yep I

00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,380
don't know she apparently decided to

00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,900
just take a nap apparently naps are

00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:09,260
things at work now III don't even I

00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:12,890
don't even know no my my cats has

00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:14,570
figured out that when I'm talking is

00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:17,180
when I'm sitting here and talking that

00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:18,860
means that I'm in a meeting and that

00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:20,570
means I'm not paying attention and she

00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:23,030
can climb on my lap and I will

00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:25,900
absent-mindedly pet her until I realized

00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:29,660
that she's not supposed to be on my lap

00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:33,290
and so yeah I like I really just thought

00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:41,290
to give in but it's it's just so hard

00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:41,290
she's soaked she's so cute at computing

00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:52,730
have you been having any new features to

00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:54,950
Yancey with new web technologies so not

00:49:52,730 --> 00:50:00,680
yet the there are things I want to do

00:49:54,950 --> 00:50:02,240
absolutely especially INRI offline sync

00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,040
so service workers would be really nice

00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:06,530
if you know a user is using the editor

00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:11,330
and if they lose temporary conative 'ti

00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:15,050
we shouldn't have to care but also off

00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:17,540
the web off I really really really like

00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:19,900
the idea of the browser as the as the

00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:23,690
auth and I really really really dislike

00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:25,580
how all of my own things follow me

00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:29,780
around why

00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:31,310
I don't think that you know random forum

00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,650
website needs to be able to post to my

00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:37,010
Twitter feed even though they all asked

00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:41,960
for it like and we can't deny them

00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:43,430
because you know whatever so yeah not

00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,220
much

00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:48,760
I do use I use view for data binding I

00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:52,070
have to rewrite that editor a little bit

00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:56,390
to make it more of a single page app and

00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:59,030
more more addressable so you can deep

00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:01,400
link into the app that's I guess one of

00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:04,600
the big things about the web as opposed

00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:07,790
to a desktop app is how do you send a

00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:13,910
user to a specific place in a desktop

00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:17,840
app like how do you say here you have to

00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:19,580
do like a 20 step like document on how

00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:23,270
to get there click here click there

00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:27,260
click there and just hope that their app

00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:29,180
is the same as yours but whereas with a

00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:31,820
web app I can just say here go to this

00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:36,020
URL there I am that's that's the exact

00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:40,400
place that I'm looking at so it pains me

00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:42,770
when I see a I can't do that but and and

00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,410
well Nancy is one of them and so I gotta

00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:48,440
fix that it is there anything you can

00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:53,450
say about mojolicious in terms of the

00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:55,520
history of it because I used to answer

00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:57,470
and I've been trying to switch to

00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,330
mojolicious for some things and

00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:03,320
especially the the asynchronous of

00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:04,880
things and you know the I guess what I

00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,440
found most people said what modulus just

00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,720
had problems and then suddenly it just

00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:11,150
worked that was kind of the story it's

00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,770
like what was that about well what was

00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:15,800
the history moment where it just

00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:16,340
suddenly worked that is an excellent

00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:20,330
question

00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:24,320
and so I believe for the early days of

00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:27,170
mojolicious I was working for a company

00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:32,330
that developed their own web application

00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:34,550
framework slash CMS so I watched with

00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:38,900
great interest but I wasn't really kind

00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:42,500
of part of it I know that mojolicious

00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,960
does take a different view towards

00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:48,710
backwards-compatibility

00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:51,080
in that Sebastian is absolutely fine

00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:55,970
with breaking things if they need to be

00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:59,420
broken like for example when that's when

00:52:55,970 --> 00:53:02,410
that you can do you know you can do

00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:07,460
route escalations through at CGI

00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:09,520
thing for I think that was bugzilla that

00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:13,370
that guy found with vulnerability in

00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:15,110
like that buried a mojolicious broke

00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,940
compatibility with with its previous

00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:22,430
version and made it so that you couldn't

00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:24,800
do that and well some of the rest of the

00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:29,330
rest of the stuff and pearl that was a

00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:31,820
interesting interesting moment but so

00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:33,830
yeah the the other thing I guess is yeah

00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,570
the reason it broke compatibility in the

00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:41,300
first place with catalyst was to be

00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:42,740
asynchronous and so there is a little

00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:46,040
bit more of a I guess of a support

00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:48,820
burden in upgrading but as I was just

00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:52,010
thinking about earlier at Sawyer's talk

00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:54,530
like why do I think that I can change

00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:58,160
everything about my app except the code

00:53:54,530 --> 00:54:03,410
of the app so that is the OS the tool

00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:05,120
chain the libraries you know everything

00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:09,740
the browser that I'm using to view it

00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:12,560
and why do I think that that's not like

00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:14,540
that I should always be able to to do

00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:19,160
that and my app will work exactly the

00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:23,650
same as it always has and it seems kind

00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:26,360
of crazy but with that being said I am

00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:30,740
I'm a pragmatist not a prescriptivists

00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:32,060
so like I'm definitely for you know

00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:34,700
using whatever fine stuff you find

00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:38,690
comfortable but also there's a reason

00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:42,020
why you couldn't use both like use

00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:44,500
smaller mojolicious mojolicious liked

00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:48,380
servers for whatever WebSockets you need

00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:52,250
and you know keep your keep your your

00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:54,890
library of dancer applications

00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:57,110
as you need let's just curious what that

00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:59,720
moment was where where things started

00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:02,450
looking excuse me sorry we need to end

00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:04,760
the zoom session so the next session can

00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:10,480
begin unfortunately we can't all right

00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:10,480
