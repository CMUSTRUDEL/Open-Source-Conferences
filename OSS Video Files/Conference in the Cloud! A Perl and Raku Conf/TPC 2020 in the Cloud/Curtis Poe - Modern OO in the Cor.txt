Title: Curtis Poe - Modern OO in the Cor

Description: 
	I plan to bring modern OO to the Perl core. I’ve been stealing ideas from Stevan Little, Damian Conway, and anyone else foolish enough to leave their ideas lying around. This talk is about Cor: my modern OO proposal. Sawyer’s expressed interest and it's likely it will go into the Perl core.

I’m not going to beat around the bush: writing object-oriented code in Perl is a shambolic mess. Some people want to use bless and hand-roll everything, others insist upon using Moo/se, while still others others reach for Class::Std, Spiffy, Class::Tiny, some in-house monstrosity their company uses and so on. You have to relearn it again and again and again.

In this talk I’ll explain Cor, an attempt to design a modern OO system for the Per core. Currently the syntax still feels like Perl, but it fixes many problems with existing systems and will leapfrog the capabilities of OO systems in many other languages.
