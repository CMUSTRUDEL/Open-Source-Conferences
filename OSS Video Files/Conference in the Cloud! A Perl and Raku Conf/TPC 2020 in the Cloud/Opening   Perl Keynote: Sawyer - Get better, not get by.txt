all right thank you everybody for

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,609
allowing me a few minutes of your time

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,259
this morning or afternoon or evening

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:09,719
wherever you're at

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,700
I promise only take about two or four

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,110
minutes first off I would just like to

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,429
thank the people of the pearl

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,070
foundations and the people you've

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,600
already been listening to this morning

00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:21,270
for for making this conference still

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,769
happen we were really excited at cpanel

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,869
last year to hear that we'd be doing the

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,060
pearl conference in Houston which is C

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,490
panels hometown we're really excited to

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,810
get to show you guys our city show you

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,669
some of the things that we love about it

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,860
and like many of you we were really

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,420
disappointed that kind of the situation

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,790
and the world has prevented us from

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,180
getting together physically but the

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,430
effort put in to still make this event

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,760
happen is nothing short of monumental

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,379
and is quite inspiring honestly and it's

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,500
really a testament to this community and

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,809
how strong it is so as you go through

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,579
your week maybe even in the next coming

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,739
weeks I encourage you to reach out to

00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,910
the people in the Pro Foundation and let

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,140
them know that you care let them know

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,960
that you appreciate the work that they

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,060
do and the same thing for the speakers

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,340
one thing that if you haven't done a

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,310
conference talk you may not totally grok

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,350
is that a lot of doing a talk is kind of

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,360
this engagement with the audience and

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,040
really filling this energy that energy

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,770
is going to be so much harder to really

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,979
feel and appreciate so take the time to

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,600
hit up the the reviews and get that

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,590
feedback and also just kind of shoot

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,200
people a note and tell them that you

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,360
appreciate what they're doing so a

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,950
little bit about C panel C panel is the

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,009
web hosting platform of choice we're a

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,360
web hosting automation control panel

00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:37,860
based in Houston Texas but we have

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,720
people kind of spread out here and there

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:44,189
and we are hiring so if you are on the

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,229
hunt for a job looking for a new

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,939
challenge with something to do please

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,979
feel free to reach out to anybody you

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,869
see at the conference who works for C

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,820
panels start a conversation you can also

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,210
find a full listing of our job openings

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,770

we'd love to hear from you we'd love to

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,469
see what opportunities exist out there

00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:07,950
so without further ado I would like to

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:10,379
introduce our first keynote speaker this

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,319
is a person that you probably most know

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,080
for being the current pumpkin for Perl

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,000
maybe even a

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,310
container contributor to a number of

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,740
different projects such as dancer dancer

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,100
to ref you till module starter and a

00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:27,460
variety of others may be less commonly

00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:30,520
known if she is a avid creator a

00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:34,300
musician multiple instruments very

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:37,300
creative person even an avid crochet and

00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,800
probably most importantly the owner of

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,170
the Mohawk at the center of the pearl

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:47,500
universe it's my pleasure to introduce

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:49,720
Sawyer X really we tested this right so

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,060
I thought it would just be the best

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:57,209
experience I could do by just actually

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:59,950
failing on turning on the microphone so

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:03,310
thank you very much bill thank you a lot

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,380
I want to thank the organizers as well I

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,840
wouldn't think the sponsors

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,790
I'm really happy to do this conference

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,580
I'm really happy to be here it's really

00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,620
I think a unique experience I'm gonna

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,750
I'm gonna remember and I'm I hope you

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,489
have a really good time and I'm happy

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,590
that it happened in a time zone that I

00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:23,769
could enjoy from a completely different

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:26,320
continent so it's great I also wanna

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:30,340
just before I start thank everyone who

00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,110
is attending it's not trivial and it's

00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,050
really great I'm gonna imagine that I

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,450
see people I'm not gonna see anyone so

00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:42,970
that's gonna be interesting

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:47,910
okay so I'm gonna do a screen share for

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,910
the entire desktop see if that works and

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:55,989
this is gonna be my talk I hope you

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:58,030
enjoy it I am NOT gonna be taking any

00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,630
questions through this entire thing

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:04,360
unless I have a bit of time at the end

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,769
also Turin has my has my numbers in case

00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,910
there's anything urgent that's the only

00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:10,299
way I'm gonna know about it so I'm not

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:12,310
looking any chat or anything else since

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:14,769
I can't hear anything I imagine that you

00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:18,700
hear me speaking and if not Todd will

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:20,229
let me know so before I start I probably

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,050
should mention a little bit about me

00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:24,650
just for people who don't know who I am

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,600
and why I'm here to talk

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:31,310
I should have had this slide because I

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,480
had Phil which is nice I'm still gonna

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,630
keep it though because I can't remove it

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,360
now it's too late so first of all so

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,330
your ex I'm my day job is am a principle

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,580
developer on the purl project lead which

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,730
is what we call the pumpking it's just a

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,860
name that we use and then I I did work

00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,200
and I still do in various pro modules

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,390
and frameworks I tend to be a very loud

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,070
speaker and for this I apologize in

00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,420
advance I'm probably going to yell

00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,140
you're probably gonna see a lot of hands

00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:02,360
it's gonna be very awkward and and I

00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,440
would I would keep my hands on the

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,560
volume controls just in case before we

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,390
begin though I want to say a few words

00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,660
about a friend that we we lost this

00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:17,480
February Jeff Goff has been a community

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,550
member for a very long time in the

00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,850
Bronco community in the pro community

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,130
this picture was taken in February just

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,220
a few days before at FOSDEM where Jeff

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:30,770
helped with the booth as he always does

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:35,780
I want to say that if you didn't have

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:38,000
the the pleasure of knowing Jeff then at

00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:41,140
the very least you're not gonna have to

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,380
feel this this void that now we feel

00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:52,160
with Jeff being gone so this talk is

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:55,220
gonna be in three main parts part one is

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,200
gonna be about Crow 532 I always talk

00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,419
about the latest version and just just

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,160
Saturday like just Saturday we release

00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:02,900
the new version so it's got some

00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,100
enhancements optimization you know I'm

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,780
gonna talk about some of the stuff that

00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,130
we did there

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,810
part two is gonna be a story of

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,210
priorities and I think it's very

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,790
important to talk about priorities in

00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,560
order to understand the last step which

00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,850
is really the plan that we have set up

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:24,050
for Pearl now I do want to warn you that

00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:26,419
the plan is quite bold so take a seat

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,669
take a deep breath I suggest maybe a

00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:30,260
drink it could be water it could be tea

00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:33,880
it could be coffee could be something

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,880
stronger I'm gonna let you decide which

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:41,240
but as to just having one ready

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:44,060
now let's start with 532 first who made

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,360
it a lot of people worked on 532 roughly

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,340
nine eight people maybe but more some of

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,410
them in this conference I'm actually

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,740
wearing a shirt that one of them made

00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:57,229
which is of what the pro longers so

00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,699
thank you Brian and I'm actually gonna

00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:00,949
name drop some of these people because I

00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:03,070
think it is important that you know of

00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:06,259
some of the people who work on it so

00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:08,990
first one big thing that we did we moved

00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:12,650
to github for ticket handling we used to

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:14,690
use our tea since forever but there's a

00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,270
lot of maintenance overhead and our

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:20,720
system administrators have to deal with

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:23,300
a lot of mess moving to github allowed

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,460
us to control that it allows to work

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,510
with authenticated users so the spam

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,800
went down to zero it's a major change

00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:33,740
additionally one of the nice things that

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,139
we got from this is that we're able to

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,180
get a lot of Drive Ike dropped by

00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:39,949
contributions were able to review things

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,690
more quickly we're able to merge things

00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:43,699
more quickly we have continuous

00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,510
integration to do a bunch of testing

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:49,789
it's really really nice I want to give a

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:52,280
big thank you to to people who worked on

00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:55,030
it a lot and that's a Todd who was just

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,180
speaking to our Bernardo and Nicola

00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,750
Rochelle ammonia which I hope I

00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,940
pronounced it correctly

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,620
I was practicing if you would like to

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,590
look at Perl if you would like to

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,229
contribute you can just go to github

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:13,310
pro/5 you'll find us there so what else

00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:16,340
did we do we also introduced the is--as

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,889
operator the is operator allows you to

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,900
do the is a check between an object and

00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,630
a package this was done by Paul Evans

00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,720
Lee owner thank you for doing this we

00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:28,310
also have chained comparisons this was

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,130
somebody's Efrain so now you can compare

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:34,940
multiple variables at the same time it's

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:36,320
really nice and of course Unicode 13 is

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:41,599
now supported thank you to Carl

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:43,400
Williamson so the Unicode every version

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,680
that we get we get new things and every

00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,230
version of Unicode what we get is new

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,620
scripts Corrections improvements new

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,500
characters but they think the

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,120
people remember his emojis so we

00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,330
actually do get all these new emojis and

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,940
I try to highlight every year the one or

00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,430
two emojis that I really liked I have

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,529
ignored the whiskey emoji in the past

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,140
because it is not relevant to me but I

00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:10,510
did share the avocado emoji which you

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,910
know avocados are very relevant to me so

00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,860
in this case I thought it would be very

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,650
important to share one that is a

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:20,740
combination of multiple other emojis now

00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:22,720
Pro allows you to just use backslash

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,589
uppercase n and then give whatever

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,760
Unicode characters you want to use and

00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:29,320
it's very interesting we could use

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,480
something called the zero with Joyner

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,310
and in Unicode you can combine two

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,350
things with the zero with Joyner in the

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,870
middle and then create a new thing as

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,730
long as it's supported by Unicode so

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,890
they've added the ability to combine

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:45,550
these two things this is what this code

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:48,300
shows if we take a white flag and we

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,410
combine it using the zero with Joyner to

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,330
something that's the technical term of

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:54,070
it mail with stroke and mail with female

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,940
sign don't know if you know what that

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,400
one is

00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,010
but combining them together what you

00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,300
actually get is the transplant which i

00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:06,100
think is very appropriate in this

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,920
difficult times to a lot of communities

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,209
so I'm very happy with this I think it's

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,910
really really cool that we can finally

00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,709
do this as the Unicode character it's

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,839
really awesome

00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:19,120
we also introduced no indirect so this

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,490
is a prog month at allows you to remove

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,730
indirect syntax I'm gonna cover indirect

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:28,330
syntax a little bit later so I hope this

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:32,800
will help also we've optimized the

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:34,959
common sort I believe this was Xena and

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,600
I think Thomas I can't pronounce the

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,880
name correctly I really apologize the

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,850
comments are now noticeably faster some

00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,800
benchmarks showed it at about 5% which

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,500
is very useful because we use sort a lot

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:52,570
so if you do a to be B to a this is now

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:55,300
much faster now I always have one bug

00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:58,690
that we closed one way or the other that

00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:01,770
is my favorite for this release this one

00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:04,370
is my favorite because it is also the

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:07,610
oldest known open book that we

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:10,460
still had this was github three three

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:13,580
nine or rt-11 seven zero and if you know

00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:16,130
a little bit about the the ticket

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,960
numbers that we have in our tea this is

00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:21,650
really old like this is really really

00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:24,890
old how old it was report in 1999 it

00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:27,620
also has my favorite comment on a ticket

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:30,110
that someone wrote which was I mean this

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,790
I won't be able to pull off the accent

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:36,380
so I'm just gonna let you read it and

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:38,180
enjoy it github it's great okay so there

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,460
are a few also changes that we've done

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,350
things that happened that I want to give

00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,060
some credit to and share it didn't apply

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:49,550
to many of the categories above so I'm

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:52,070
gonna put them here first we have open

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:54,350
the function open if you call Pradesh F

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,589
open you get the documentation from Pro

00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:00,110
funk and the documentation for the open

00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:02,240
key word had been overhauled by Jason

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,130
McIntosh this was not as part of a TPF

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,600
grant this is part of the work that

00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,160
happens when you donate to the Perl

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,830
foundation so please do consider

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,690
donating to the Pro Foundation and what

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,250
Jason did was completely overhauled the

00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,680
documentation to provide a modern

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,029
documentation open specifically was

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,650
something that I complained about a lot

00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:23,959
is a good example of how difficult good

00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,779
documentation can be but what Jason did

00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:29,450
was move all of the edge cases to the

00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:31,279
bottom he documented very clearly all of

00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,170
the code there's really nice code that

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,620
you want to copy paste because it's just

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:38,060
done well and it's very clear and it's

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,029
just something you'd be proud of people

00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:44,209
using it's written in simple terms you

00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:46,760
can understand it the technical is is

00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:49,970
pushed to where it's relevant very very

00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,320
very nice work and I think it's I was

00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,950
very impressed with him I'm really happy

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,350
we have this the lexer was significantly

00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:00,350
refactored by Erin crane who basically

00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,350
toured the lexer and cleaned it up to

00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,300
different sections so it's much more

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:08,480
fathomable the lexer is a very big part

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,850
of the Perl interpreter and he had

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,670
always been difficult to fathom but now

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:16,520
it is much easier to work with so Thank

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,500
You Erin we also have a new security

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,440
lead so see

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:23,670
Shirley is one of those teams that pearl

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,770
has that doesn't receive much attention

00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:29,410
especially when things go well but I

00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:32,380
think is so important that it's we

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,780
should be talking about it so we now

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,330
have a new security lead that's JD JD

00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,770
has been doing excellent work he was

00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,740
able to close all of our outstanding

00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,360
security tickets and he'd been able to

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,130
get us on the on the path for

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,040
understanding how to do better releases

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,020
faster releases more more secure

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,210
releases and a lot of these things part

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,060
of what JD has to do is security just

00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:57,070
big fYI he has to determine whether

00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,420
something is a vulnerability so it needs

00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,760
to be classified it does that with the

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:04,570
rest of the security team a CV has to be

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,670
done usually usually done by Tony

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:10,360
because he's willing Tony crook wrote

00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:12,070
the note in direct as well JD has to

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,960
make sure that we talk to the people who

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,430
open the tickets that we keep them in

00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,160
touch that we talk to distributors to

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:21,040
vendors that we determine whether

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,660
something has to be disclosed and what

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,250
is the disclosure day and then how do we

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,320
release that with the information ahead

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,830
of time and coordinated everything and

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,170
there's just so much to do and JD is on

00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:35,740
top of it and I couldn't be happier with

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:39,040
JD joining the team and thank you very

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,839
much we also added on the security team

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,580
we also added Jim keen into the security

00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,010
team if you familiar with Jim's work

00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,050
he's been all over the ticket I would

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:51,720
call him the Ticket Master for Perl or

00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:54,700
at least then I don't know title for a

00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,320
ticket Wrangler but Jim is kind of aware

00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:01,600
of everything that's going on across

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,160
Perl and in the sense it's vital for Jim

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,660
to also have some insight into what's

00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,900
going on in security because it affects

00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:11,380
things outside security now I haven't

00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:15,010
gone over everything the way name 532

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:18,430
what I want to do is go over priorities

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,839
and priorities are very important if we

00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,910
understand their priorities we will

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,580
understand where we're going in the

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,530
future pearl now to talk about

00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,470
priorities we're at a conference I think

00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:31,180
it's really a good example to talk about

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,370
conferences and that would be an example

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,530
of how to prioritize things and you

00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,730
think if you've ever been a conference

00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,830
organ as you familiar with this but if

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:41,110
you haven't try to imagine yourself as a

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:45,730
conference organizer when I'm talking

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:48,070
about this so I'm going to describe

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,990
three people Caleb who is a considerate

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,209
conference attendee I'm gonna describe

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,580
Patrick who's a problematic conference

00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:56,980
attendee and Nia who is a newcomer

00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:01,000
conference attendee these are not named

00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:03,940
after anyone specific there are probably

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,620
people named Patrick Kay Lavinia who go

00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,209
to conferences there are probably

00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,430
problematic people named Patrick in

00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:13,360
general but I'm not this is not based on

00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:15,430
anyone in particular and through these

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,100
stories I'd like to talk about

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,080
prioritization Patrick being problematic

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,870
could be the way that he behaves with

00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,370
others it could be the way that he acts

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,350
it could be the way the kind of talks

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:29,470
that he gives or how he behaves during

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,900
talks during the hallways etc you can

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,550
have your own definition of problematic

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,190
but I'm sure we will all agree that we

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,589
have very clear ideas of a problematic

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,300
means Nia is a newcomer she wants to

00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:43,600
enjoy the conference and Caleb is

00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,220
basically familiar with Patrick but also

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,959
wants to make sure Nia has a good time

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,690
so he tries to kind of run interference

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,089
and a lot of conferences they have these

00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:56,140
kinds of people like these three broad

00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:58,540
categories now if we're talking about

00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,190
the success of the conference there are

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,800
a lot of ways to measure whether it's

00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:05,380
successful or not to me there is one big

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,660
definition of success and that is

00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,610
whether the conference ended up being a

00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:13,569
home to the people who come to the

00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:15,610
conference you could validate in a lot

00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:18,010
of ways but to me just the fact that you

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,329
feel like this is a this is your

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,800
community this is where you go it

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,450
doesn't matter if you have been

00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,800
programming pro for a very long time it

00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,510
doesn't matter if you were new to this

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,680
it doesn't matter if you use Perl or you

00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,850
program in a different language it

00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,730
doesn't matter if you're not even in

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:33,220
developer this is not the critical part

00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,690
it is that you feel comfortable and you

00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,250
feel like this is your home this is your

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,920
family these are your friends and your

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:41,380
peers and there are three measures to it

00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,180
one is that it is inclusive it needs to

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,130
be welcoming needs to be accepting of

00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,770
others but other than just being

00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:51,400
inclusive and welcoming it also needs to

00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:55,150
be diverse which is to be composed of

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,820
other people as well not just to allow

00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:00,790
these people to join but to be made out

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,400
of all of these people and lastly it

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,750
needs to be supportive which means we

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,060
have to be helpful we have to be

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,710
uplifting towards each other but if you

00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,420
have all these three you're likely to

00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:14,590
generate a home no matter who the people

00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:18,370
are now let's go back to our three

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:20,770
people so when a conference doesn't have

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,900
any standards for how to behave how to

00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,550
act when there is no way to enforce

00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,670
anything when there is no way to control

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:30,160
in any way the behavior of others or

00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,540
monitor it or or address it at the very

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,510
least I think that's the most accurate

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:37,360
definition I could give it the balance

00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:40,150
is kind of weird so let's take a look at

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,750
the situation with Patrick being a very

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:45,610
problematic person for a conference

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:48,310
organizer and the conference attendee it

00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:50,260
is a high investment you have to avoid

00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:52,030
Patrick you have to manage Patrick you

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,550
have to work around him you have to

00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:58,570
ignore him this is very annoying it's a

00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:01,180
lot of investment but the newcomers and

00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,640
the considerate attendees there are low

00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,960
investment we don't have to put effort

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,900
they have to put effort and we have to

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,750
put effort with Patrick now on the other

00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:14,230
side of this Patrick doesn't actually

00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:16,480
contribute much he diminishes the

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,320
inclusivity that we have the diversity

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,410
the community and this is a real problem

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:26,800
also for a lot of these people I think

00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:28,270
Patrick's understanding is that his

00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,460
contribution is that has been at the

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,080
conference a long time but with a lot of

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,340
these cases

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,169
or conferences it's any kind of

00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,309
conference not even technical one what

00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:38,710
we see is that a lot of these people

00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:40,809
diminish the inclusivity over time so

00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:44,409
the longer they're at the conference and

00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:46,299
the the worst job we do in managing them

00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:47,529
the more they reduce the amount of

00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:49,120
people who will join the conference or

00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:52,090
feel confident and comfortable at the

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,419
conference but Caleb Ania do increase

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:57,370
inclusivity because new people show up

00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:59,799
so there's a really weird balance here

00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,929
we're printing a lot of investment on

00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,620
people who diminish we're not putting

00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:07,539
investment on people who increase if I

00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:11,830
were to do a cost-benefit analysis this

00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:14,799
picture would be kind of grim the effort

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,210
from problematic person is very low they

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,929
don't have to put any effort they're

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:22,419
just themselves obnoxious inappropriate

00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:23,889
uncomfortable offensive but the

00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:25,990
community game is also very low from

00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:29,080
these people so that's this is kind of

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:31,510
weird and then for considering people as

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,000
well as for newcomers they have to put a

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:36,159
lot of effort even though they bring a

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,860
lot to the community so they have to

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,539
carry so much weight even though they

00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,100
provide the most and then people who

00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,779
provide the least have to put the least

00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,840
amount of weight which is really weird

00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:47,559
because it creates the situation where

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,649
problematic people have the best

00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:52,059
experience at the conference and

00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:53,860
newcomers inconsiderate people have the

00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:59,590
worst experience the conference which is

00:20:53,860 --> 00:21:02,110
really bad in other in other terms so an

00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,460
analysis would be the we might cater to

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,529
the problematic people who harm us

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,919
instead of being open to well behaved

00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:10,809
attendees the conclusion is we need to

00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:12,639
prioritize toward people who help the

00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:16,360
conference and other attendees instead

00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:18,190
of those who harm them now a code of

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,929
conduct could be reduced because can

00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:22,090
help create a conference that improves

00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:24,340
the community instead of diluting it it

00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:26,559
hopes enforce standards of behavior if

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,360
you have never really understood why

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,429
code of Kanye is important what

00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,980
standards of behavior are important to

00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:35,529
conference organizers this is why it

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:39,639
allows a conference organiser to change

00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:42,220
the priority to focus on newcomers to

00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:43,809
focus on people who act well towards

00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,960
each other to focus on considerate

00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:47,970
people and then to address

00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,220
people who are problematic and spending

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,260
less time addressing them I don't need

00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,120
to convince a problematic person to

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,980
behave better I can just point to the

00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,510
code of Canaan say there's a violation

00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,030
here and he needs to be addressed and

00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:02,000
then I can work through it with them but

00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:05,400
at the same time it gives me a tool to

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,480
address that problem other than running

00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,920
interference around it which is very

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,340
difficult to do and it puts the weight

00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:16,850
on everyone else so we talked about this

00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,380
this prioritization had a conference but

00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,570
we were at a conference and we have the

00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:25,290
now we have the TPF camp which is really

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:26,820
really cool and a great props to Stuart

00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,130
and the Pro Foundation for organizing

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,030
this I'm actually talking about language

00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:32,880
here I'm not talking about the

00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:35,760
conference so I should yeah I'm gonna

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,360
switch back so okay let's talk about the

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,430
users let's talk about language users I

00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:45,060
have Murray Murray is a maintainer we

00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:48,810
have also Anna who's an absentee and we

00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,430
have Naveen who's a novice now tell you

00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,900
a little bit about each one and then

00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,760
we're gonna explore the concept of

00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,740
prioritization just like we did with

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,020
with the conference but we're gonna

00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,480
explore this concept when it comes to

00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:04,140
programming language users specifically

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,900
these three so Anna is an absentee she

00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:10,110
does not use Perl anymore she did write

00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,580
pro a long time ago but no longer maybe

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,460
Anna writes in a different language

00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,480
maybe Einar moved to rust but maybe Anna

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,610
doesn't program anymore

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,530
maybe she has a manager position maybe

00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:22,790
she has a director position maybe she

00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:26,400
doesn't work in tech at all anymore so

00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:29,190
yeah but see but her projects might

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,130
still exist so well though some people

00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,840
use this right and the project's

00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,150
themselves at the same time don't really

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,280
get a lot of attention because Anna's

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,870
not there she's absent and if you were

00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,600
using it are not really interested in

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:44,820
giving these projects attention so

00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,920
Anna's interest and the people who use

00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,740
Anna's projects their interest is to

00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,630
have no change absolutely no change zero

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,210
breakage to the code because as long as

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:56,520
the code never changes that the language

00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:59,010
never changes along with code the number

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,660
changes everything stays the same

00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,820
as long as the environment stays exactly

00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:05,100
the same which sometimes it doesn't

00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,380
now we have Marie Marie is a maintainer

00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:10,380
she does use Perl on a daily basis

00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:13,470
probably she gets to work with it maybe

00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:16,350
writing her own code maybe maintaining

00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:18,120
other people's code and it could be

00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,799
within a company it could be you know

00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,770
just open source free software that's

00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:25,679
also good but Maria is a maintainer is

00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:27,570
someone who is actively using Perl her

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,880
interests are having new features or

00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:32,490
having new capabilities her interesting

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,260
stability is kind of medium you know it

00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:38,150
shouldn't break all the time but you

00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:41,419
know what I'm there to fix it if it does

00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:44,850
and of course in the bean who's a novice

00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:47,700
Naveen is a beginner programmer maybe

00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:50,070
not a beginner programmer maybe I beget

00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,929
a programmer to Pearl and the Venus

00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:54,419
looking for a new language maybe the

00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:56,370
first maybe the second maybe third and

00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:59,130
what he look is looking at is something

00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:01,380
that is simple to learn something that

00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:06,500
is useful and it has to be able to use

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:13,140
it for something and that means that his

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:16,350
interests are in a language that oh I'm

00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:18,570
sorry this slides moved badly right so

00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,490
his interests are in having began

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,590
features capabilities ease of learning

00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:24,360
is very important from reassuring knows

00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,559
the language but Naveen doesn't know the

00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,840
language so we want something that is

00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:29,669
easy to learn also he wants to be

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,960
capable features notice that Devine

00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:32,870
doesn't care too much about stability

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,100
because he's writing new code if

00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,290
something he just wrote broke he could

00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,760
just rewrite it on the spot because he

00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:41,120
hasn't really written anything that's

00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,120
used already

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,200
going back to definitions of success we

00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,340
talked about conferences now we're

00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,720
talking about programming language what

00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,429
is the definition of success for

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,290
programming language I'm sure there are

00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:53,760
a lot of definitions and we might have

00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,440
different definitions but I'm gonna give

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,100
the one they think makes the most sense

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,740
for every language and that is usage if

00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:04,530
the language is used that means that is

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,660
successful now some languages are

00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:08,400
written for specific domains that's okay

00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,930
but that means they have to be used

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,430
within those domains

00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:16,120
that means that needs to be robust

00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:18,730
features tooling flexibility it needs to

00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,440
be fast we always want to see feet more

00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,810
we always want to execute it faster and

00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,030
of course it needs to be reliable and

00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:26,920
people translate reliability as it never

00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:28,720
bricks but where reliability means is

00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:35,230
that predictably breaks that when you

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:37,480
brakes I know when how why now if we

00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:39,820
were talking about what a conference

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,920
without standards looks like when it

00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,080
comes to balancing the concerns of the

00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,050
different users and of a different

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,410
people come to the conference I want to

00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:52,630
try and balance the ones for Pearl so

00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,400
how does pearl balance between all of

00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,980
these people

00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:02,160
well first we put a lot of investment

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:05,230
into old code and we specifically

00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,240
particularly put effort in making sure

00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,550
that it won't ever need to change as

00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,450
much as possible the goal is that if you

00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:16,780
wrote something 20 years ago it will

00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:18,580
continue your work so we put a lot of

00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,380
investment for marine I mean we're

00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,510
putting much less investment we're not

00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:25,420
producing too many big features because

00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:26,860
it really is difficult to add them to

00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,930
the language when we have to support all

00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,150
of the old stuff we have to think of how

00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:35,440
that would look like with syntax that

00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:38,670
was written 27 years ago or a bug we we

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,770
actually had to revert and introduce a

00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,420
bug because it changed someone's

00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:45,340
behavior and they expected it to stay

00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,900
the same and this is not the first time

00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,900
by the way every year we have at least

00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,880
one major bug that we discuss for a very

00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,730
long time and that we return to the

00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,250
language even though we could fix it

00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:59,110
because we optimized for Anna and if

00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:03,670
Anna was relying on the spot we're

00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:06,160
keeping the bug then if we're looking at

00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:08,620
what we get from for usage for what our

00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:11,320
goal really is Naveen and Marie are

00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:14,610
writing code they are writing new code

00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:18,010
but Anna specifically by definition

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:20,500
demands to not rewrite or change or

00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:22,210
update any of the code which means that

00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,269
for Anna's code it could only diminish

00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,440
the usage could only go down

00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,379
you could never grow up because by

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,899
definition she isn't writing anything

00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:33,269
that means that we're we could lose the

00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:37,049
code and lose the usage we're putting

00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:38,279
all of our effort to keep it but in the

00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:41,519
area where people are trying to write

00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:43,229
new code and to use language more we're

00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,059
putting a bar there making it harder so

00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:47,159
that's the balance that we strike which

00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:50,159
is it is all when you put it in those

00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:53,609
terms let's do a cost-benefit analysis

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,119
I'm sure the picture will look better or

00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:56,549
not

00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:59,039
okay so what we have here is the

00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:01,739
absentee the cost to the absentee is low

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,139
it's almost zero the goal for them is to

00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:07,259
be absolutely zero because the idea is

00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:09,450
that the code will never get updated the

00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:13,049
game for us from them at the same time

00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,609
is very low so it's kind of odd and if

00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:16,799
we're looking at the maintainer if we're

00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:19,499
looking at a novice the cost of them is

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:22,320
very high they have to work around all

00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:23,969
of the code that was written for the

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,089
absentee or at the time that the

00:29:23,969 --> 00:29:28,409
absentee wrote their code and they have

00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:29,759
to make sure that they're not writing it

00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:31,169
that they're aware of it even though

00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,269
they shouldn't be writing it they need

00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:34,649
to understand they might write code that

00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:36,119
the language will think it's that thing

00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:37,799
instead and make sure the language

00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,879
doesn't get confused when it gets

00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:41,219
confused they have to deal with the

00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:43,019
error messages of that syntax we can't

00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:44,219
have new features easily because we have

00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:46,349
to account for all of that stuff so

00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:50,279
they're not getting what they want it's

00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:51,809
really weird and really the the best

00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:53,969
experience goes to the absentee they do

00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:56,089
nothing but they're not even interested

00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:58,859
in continuing to work on the language

00:29:56,089 --> 00:30:00,259
but they get the best experience and for

00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:02,249
the novice and the maintainer who

00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:03,959
provide us with a lot of gain and

00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:07,249
benefit they get the worst possible

00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:09,690
experience so I think we have a problem

00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:11,820
this is what my talk is about my

00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:14,070
analysis from this is that the people

00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,070
contribute to the least to the language

00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:19,499
are the most important citizen visit

00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:25,190
citizens of it I think you had too much

00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:27,770
coffee okay so

00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:29,300
I want to put it in other words the

00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,310
people who contribute the most to the

00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:34,130
language are paying for the technical

00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:37,220
debt of those who don't now we're going

00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:39,850
to cover how they have to do it just

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:43,040
like I did before but in more detail and

00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:45,140
they have to do this forever we never

00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:50,330
stop with this balance back there is no

00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:52,520
end to it in simpler terms we reward the

00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:57,350
citizens who hinder we punish those who

00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:59,150
ate and this does not seem to be it

00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:02,870
doesn't seem seem to me like the right

00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:04,370
balance you know so the conclusion is if

00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:07,340
the language wants to grow the language

00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:12,110
needs to change priorities because we're

00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:13,910
prioritizing the wrong audience okay so

00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,950
that begs the question how do we change

00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:18,890
this now let's keep this question in

00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:21,080
mind and most is in second part the the

00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:24,020
last part the plan for Pearl so what are

00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:26,240
we going to do first we need to change

00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,070
our priorities we need to identify and

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,760
understand a target audience and meet to

00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,830
help them

00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,610
more than people who are not our target

00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:37,010
audience now I spoke about the cost that

00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:39,850
Pearl developers pay I want to go into

00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:41,990
more depth and give you some examples

00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:44,510
first I want you to think of any of

00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:47,870
these sentences and ask yourself does

00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:51,980
this ring a bell for me then if it does

00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:53,540
that is actually technical cost right so

00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,490
that's that's technical debt that you're

00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:58,010
doing with this truck try a few of those

00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:59,450
so first how do you start your code if

00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:02,270
you have to think of how you store your

00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:04,400
code then you're dealing with technical

00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:09,350
debt if you need to start with like the

00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:11,930
stanza of you statements you're trying

00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,700
to work out changing the baseline of

00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:16,730
someone else to a normalized baseline

00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,230
technical debt then there's how much of

00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,060
it is tribal knowledge and what I mean

00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:22,250
is how much of this is information that

00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:24,410
is limited to a small group of people

00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,940
and then you if you're in the know if

00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,220
you're in that group then you have this

00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,990
cherished knowledge that you know why

00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:33,590
you need to do that have you ever done

00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,920
an eval on a version why would you do

00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,540
this

00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,080
well that's tribal knowledge if you have

00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:40,000
the right people they will tell you

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,470
and then of course there's also colorful

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,240
team there's a lot of stuff that we copy

00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:46,809
from each other we don't necessarily

00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:49,019
know why is certainly valuable but we

00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:51,370
always copy those which goes back to

00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:52,809
we're hoping that this is tribal

00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:56,830
knowledge that is correct

00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:58,750
maybe it is maybe it isn't there are a

00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,919
lot of awkward there are messages that

00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:02,409
you get I'm gonna give an example of

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,059
this but first I want to explain why do

00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:08,610
you have awkward error messages

00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:11,500
awkward error messages happen because

00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:12,880
Pro supports a lot of types of syntax

00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,500
it supports things that are really old

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,919
it support supports things that are

00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:20,320
newer now if you make a mistake and you

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,909
didn't write the right syntax then pearl

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,909
trust you understand what it is that you

00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:27,880
wanted to write if it happened to look

00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:29,080
like old syntax you might think that

00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:32,200
this is what you were trying to write

00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,299
and then if it gives you an error that

00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,190
you didn't write it correctly the error

00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:38,139
that you're gonna get is for syntax that

00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,570
you didn't try to write instead of for

00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:41,950
your syntax so the awkward look they the

00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,480
awkwardness here is because the error

00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:45,789
message doesn't relate at all to your

00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,350
code only to what Pro thought it might

00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:48,730
be because it's thought that you're

00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,620
writing syntax that you know you

00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:52,809
shouldn't maybe we don't even know that

00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,919
it's possible in many cases it's insects

00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:55,919
you didn't even know it was possible in

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,149
Perl but you get that error message so

00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,309
take that into account that's a cost if

00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:04,360
you've had this before and we all have

00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:06,070
that second call death and the quality

00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,419
of the tooling that you get perl bends

00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:11,050
over backwards to give you the best

00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:13,419
tooling possible ppi works so hard now

00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:17,050
we have PPR it works so hard

00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:19,780
Perl tidy works really really hard but

00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:22,839
at the end of the day how much tooling

00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:25,960
do you have in IDs how much of is custom

00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:29,290
mean how many IDs have built-in great

00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,790
tooling for Perl it's just very

00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:32,500
differently compared to other languages

00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:34,330
and that's because it's very hard to

00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,990
know what's going on because there are a

00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:40,330
lot of syntaxes and lastly overall just

00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:43,960
how much effort do you spend to make

00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:47,419
things just behave that is all technical

00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,309
debt all right so

00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:55,040
I want to give some examples of this

00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:57,230
first syntax validation now they're

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,970
oftentimes we have this thing where

00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,500
someone wants to ask for help

00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,420
they provide piece of code and then we

00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:04,010
look at and we say wait a minute this

00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:05,510
isn't right you're not starting with the

00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,339
right code you're you don't have used

00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:10,460
written use warnings we can't help you

00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:12,770
until you add you strict news what if

00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:15,309
it's so fundamental that you can't get

00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:17,569
support for it unless you added why

00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:19,609
isn't this just part of the language

00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:21,230
well in the old days people wrote

00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:24,530
without certain warnings we should

00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:26,150
maintain it that's why I want to give

00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,309
you this example which is one of my

00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:31,609
favorites because I actually had to deal

00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:32,930
with this a little while ago and this

00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:34,609
crops up every once in a while

00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,109
especially they have a large code base

00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:38,299
where we work with a lot of developers

00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:40,549
where not all of them are experts you're

00:35:38,299 --> 00:35:42,260
gonna have this situation I'm going to

00:35:40,549 --> 00:35:45,970
ignore for a moment the fact that we're

00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:48,380
I think plus 30 years from when function

00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:51,140
signatures were introduced and I still

00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,970
have to by default do a shift to get the

00:35:51,140 --> 00:36:00,349
value I'm gonna put this aside for now

00:35:52,970 --> 00:36:02,260
and hopefully my expressions clarify how

00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:04,369
difficult it is for me to put this aside

00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:07,690
I'm gonna focus on the second line there

00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:10,819
the first so I have an array people I

00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:15,200
run first and I call it has item on each

00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:17,329
one and I eventually store that I get

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,970
these errors though I have a use of an

00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:22,609
inch sized value that's input and I have

00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:24,410
can locate object method now the first

00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:29,150
warning there in the analyse value

00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:32,569
people has a value I double checked but

00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:36,980
input is still uninitialized she's

00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:38,720
really weird that doesn't make sense the

00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:42,250
only case this could happen is people is

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,720
an array with the value undeath but if

00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,490
it is an array with anything other than

00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,099
undef if it's an empty array this won't

00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:52,099
even run because there are there are no

00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:55,369
items in it the second one is really the

00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:58,579
problem here you I can't locate object

00:36:55,369 --> 00:37:00,680
method first first of all first is a

00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:02,750
function here it's a function is

00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,059
in object method it's a function but it

00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:06,770
says I this is a it's an object method

00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:09,260
that's what I think it is and I can't

00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:11,510
find it I did look for it in the package

00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,790
zero where I think it should be so pearl

00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:15,680
thinks that there's a class zero which

00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:17,900
has a method called first and then says

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,790
I can't find the package zero or at

00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,770
least I tried to access it and go for

00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:25,160
first but no and then suggest something

00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:27,530
very helpful maybe I need to use zero

00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:31,579
the module zero which does not exist

00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:33,530
that can't run use zero that's kind of

00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:35,950
weird well we're getting here is that

00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:39,380
pearl thought I meant something else and

00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:42,200
it gave me the air of this other thing

00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:45,230
and unless you know that is what the

00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,880
other thing is and why it misunderstood

00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,630
it as the other thing you will not be

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,010
able to fix it

00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,900
because there's no way for you to fix

00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:54,319
this error the only way for you is to

00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:56,990
fix the code the Pearl misunderstood as

00:37:54,319 --> 00:38:00,319
a different type of code that had this

00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:01,819
error once in a while we encountered

00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:06,349
this at work and it could take between

00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:10,609
ten minutes and several days to fix this

00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:13,579
was the air that's it C Pro has

00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:15,920
prototypes prototypes allow the

00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:18,260
developer of a subroutine of function to

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:23,589
indicate how the function should be

00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:27,799
parsed by the Perl parser it's very cool

00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:30,319
also very bad but it is very cool and if

00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:32,030
that doesn't exist when Pro hits first

00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:34,549
it doesn't know what's gonna happen now

00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,930
I want to go back for a moment we use

00:38:34,549 --> 00:38:38,150
these prototypes because we think

00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:40,040
they're really cool because they are but

00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:43,549
if you look at this even though it looks

00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:45,650
really cool to a new person coming to a

00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:46,970
newcomer to Perl this is actually very

00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:49,520
confusing because first doesn't have

00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:51,680
parentheses which are used for functions

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,619
it doesn't have it it also doesn't have

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,660
the keyword sub which is used for a

00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:59,030
callback so this looks like a bare block

00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,349
or this looks like maybe a hash ref so

00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,670
it's not really clear what that is and

00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:04,819
then there's no comment between

00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:08,089
arguments there so who has the argument

00:39:04,819 --> 00:39:09,950
on what because the only way for Perl to

00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:11,420
parses it is if you tell it to parse it

00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:13,950
it actually just tried to parse this

00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:18,119
something else which was an object

00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:19,290
at first on a package zero all right

00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,400
well that's that's an example of

00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,880
technical debt that you have to deal

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,710
with as a developer nowadays you can

00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:30,320
finally do no indirect thanks to Tony

00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:32,220
cook but really this is very annoying

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,859
this is something that I also like

00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:37,440
specifically because what happens here

00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:39,750
is I try to use something really cool

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,119
and I get no errors and warnings and

00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:45,030
something entirely different happens I

00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:47,010
have an array foo bar I'm trying to

00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:48,450
access two values at the same time which

00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,349
is something you can do in Perl I use it

00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:52,020
a lot

00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:54,480
it is incredibly useful so I'm accessing

00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:56,550
hash foo bar and I'm getting I'm setting

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,609
one to that one the other one - Val -

00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:01,859
they are both undefined even though I

00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:04,040
see them one and two and they're

00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:07,260
undefined this is even harder to debug

00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:09,240
I'm gonna for those guessing usually

00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,220
when we're all together physically I'll

00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,450
get people to to raise their hand you

00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,099
could try to raise your hand I won't see

00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:17,420
it but go ahead and raise your hand if

00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,420
you know what the problem is

00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:24,720
congratulations if you figure it out it

00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:28,140
is one single character see when this is

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,700
a dollar sign sigil there pearl

00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:34,349
understands that you're trying to access

00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:36,599
one key even though I gave two keys now

00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:38,550
when I give two keys but I only ask for

00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,920
one but pearl understand is that I'm

00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,579
trying the multi-dimensional syntax if

00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,640
you don't know where the

00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:46,829
multi-dimensional syntax is well you

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,150
shouldn't it's not something you want to

00:40:46,829 --> 00:40:51,510
use what do you actually do is take both

00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:53,130
of those keys mix them together using a

00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:55,020
variable they don't even know about and

00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:57,390
then try to access that as a single key

00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,550
that's why this would work that's why

00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:02,400
you also won't get an error or a warning

00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:04,200
it will work pearl says yes this is some

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,140
different syntax and I'm sure this is

00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:09,990
what you wanted to write really this is

00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:12,569
what I wanted to write so no in fact

00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:15,300
what I wanted to write was this give me

00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:18,089
to give me the values for key foo and

00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:19,619
the value for key bar all right so now

00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:22,230
you can do no multi-dimensional but this

00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:23,579
is on CPM there's also bear word file

00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,980
handle and see there's like a bunch of

00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:27,680
these things

00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:30,020
had a core developer summit where we

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,390
tried to write down all the things that

00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,910
we enable that to us is like a good

00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:37,970
baseline for Perl that list I think was

00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:40,400
around eight to ten lines imagine that

00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:42,410
every single time just to get to the

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,869
right baseline but that is the cost that

00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:47,150
you have to pay as developers who

00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:49,340
continue to develop who are willing to

00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:52,460
update a piece of code but you still

00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,080
have to do this and I mean all of these

00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,750
should have been removed but they

00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:00,170
haven't there's a bunch of things under

00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,760
syntax under feature so if you use use

00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:04,609
feature you can use a bunch of these

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:08,480
there are also a bunch of these programs

00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:12,320
you can enable and disable so since X

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,790
features have to be enabled using a use

00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,859
feature or they have to be enabled using

00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:19,400
use experimental if they're experimental

00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:22,160
features and otherwise and this is kind

00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:24,710
of a problem I looked this up if you are

00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,990
not enabling anything you're using the

00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,500
syntax of 2002 so when you start a Perl

00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,440
program

00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:33,050
I'm my my view of the best Perl program

00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:36,830
the best beginning stanza of a Perl

00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:39,440
program is nothing it is empty open the

00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:41,060
file that's the best Pro you have but no

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,660
you don't have this instead you're

00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:47,630
starting 2002 and then you have to tack

00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:50,630
on top of it stuff that is new which is

00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:53,090
very grim statement for me to make

00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:55,130
really when you're picking up the latest

00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:57,859
Perl Saturday I'm looking behind me cuz

00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:59,990
Saturday was behind me and Saturday we

00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:03,290
released 532 we've been working on this

00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:06,440
for a year 13 months actually but you

00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:11,869
still move back 18 years in syntax right

00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:13,550
how can we okay all right this works

00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:15,170
because we introduced features with

00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:17,780
feature cards and I want to explain how

00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:19,250
feature guards work feature cards are

00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:22,760
these things use feature use

00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:25,490
experimental use V accuse v5 10 News v5

00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,140
32 they enable these things use feature

00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:29,270
enables specific features use

00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:31,010
experimental enables the features if

00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:35,000
they're experimental without a warning

00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:37,070
and use v5 whatever would turn on all of

00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,819
the ones that arrived at that version

00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:41,209
and

00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:44,539
sure this is the minimum version feature

00:43:41,209 --> 00:43:46,910
guards are very interesting they guard

00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:48,589
the syntax the idea is that it would

00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,959
never change unless you request it which

00:43:48,589 --> 00:43:52,880
is a really good idea because it defends

00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:57,589
against undesired syntax and semantics

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,630
so if you think about Python tree Python

00:43:57,589 --> 00:44:01,969
3 introduced Unicode semantics and

00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:04,400
suddenly all the code was numb by it was

00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:05,900
suddenly unicode characters and we could

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,209
do the same we have unicode string you

00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,949
can do use feature unicode strings but

00:44:08,209 --> 00:44:11,479
then you have to account for it

00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:13,309
everywhere which means the semantics

00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:16,670
changed and maybe you didn't want that

00:44:13,309 --> 00:44:19,519
so that's that's future cards help you

00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:21,289
against that it's really good and it's

00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:22,579
fairly unique I couldn't find many

00:44:21,289 --> 00:44:25,940
programming languages that have any

00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:28,069
concept like this but extra 5 which is

00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,569
the JavaScript standard they actually

00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:31,309
added you strict and I'm not just

00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:33,349
quoting there it is added with a string

00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:35,869
it's at it as a string the idea is that

00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:38,479
it's a void statement as a string it

00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:41,779
does nothing in the story where and if

00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:43,609
you're using EC 5 PS 5 it will

00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:46,299
understand it turn on strict they

00:44:43,609 --> 00:44:50,119
literally took you straight from Perl

00:44:46,299 --> 00:44:51,199
but if you're using an older version it

00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,079
would just see a string and everything

00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:56,180
would be fine for what it's worth if you

00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,829
do this in Pro you put something just as

00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,359
a string without actually doing

00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:00,979
something with it Pro will warn you and

00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,989
tell you you're doing this thing but it

00:45:00,979 --> 00:45:05,359
has zero effect every program you

00:45:02,989 --> 00:45:07,759
probably didn't want to do this but you

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,799
know JavaScript it's fine

00:45:07,759 --> 00:45:11,449
and you might be thinking yeah this is

00:45:09,799 --> 00:45:14,049
great so we can do things this way it's

00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:14,049
great except

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,180
fault for everything it didn't keep it

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,970
as you have to enable it all modules in

00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,290
ESX automatically have used strict so

00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,359
they're kind of using it but those

00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:27,470
showing us something now I think it's

00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:31,280
very important to learn a few lessons

00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:32,480
from others what I would like to say is

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,460
that feature guards although being

00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,760
really awesome they actually have issues

00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:40,280
if you had not noticed them yet the

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,589
problem first one the major problem is

00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,900
that they are tribal knowledge whether

00:45:42,589 --> 00:45:47,569
we like it or not

00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:49,910
see the thing you have know about them

00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:52,280
not everyone does I was writing that

00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:53,780
slide and I was looking at p5p and IRC

00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:56,510
and I found this quote by Bram who

00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:59,390
allowed me gave me permission to share

00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:01,400
it with you hero indeed I wasn't really

00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:04,700
aware of underscores of underscores

00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:07,099
until now it was introduced in 5:16 now

00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:09,640
underscores sub underscores is it a

00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:12,470
great feature which is used for

00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:14,359
providing the current subroutine point

00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:16,099
so if you were doing on a lot of

00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:19,309
functional programming this is

00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:22,880
incredibly useful you have to enable

00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:25,579
with use feature current so now you

00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,829
might be thinking okay this is this is

00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:30,710
probably a new thing right it's 5:16 no

00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:35,450
no play 16 came out eight years ago

00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:37,280
eight this is not new now the next thing

00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:39,950
you're gonna say is well of course maybe

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,630
brand is an outsider you know brand only

00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:43,579
started with pro and he joined you know

00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,869
the channel and he just went like wow

00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:48,799
this is crazy I don't even know about

00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:52,190
this no Ram is actually a consistent

00:46:48,799 --> 00:46:54,319
person on p5p also the assistant pro

00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:56,180
help from newbie it's not any of those

00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:59,420
things this is P Phi P this is the

00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:01,609
porters this is the chat in which we

00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:05,859
discuss the implementation detail of

00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:09,680
these things there is no more inner

00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:11,930
circle of knowledge obviously open to

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,900
everyone but most people don't go so

00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:16,790
there is no more technical inner

00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,290
knowledge that incontinent on P Phi P

00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:20,599
and this person still didn't know about

00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:22,309
it so what does that tell you these are

00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:23,900
not random people who don't know about

00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:25,220
this these are not beginners who don't

00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,680
know about this is our stuff knowing

00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:29,000
about this raise your hand if you didn't

00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,490
know about currents up don't

00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,720
I'm not even looking I won't see it but

00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:41,780
I mean let's be honest so it's a problem

00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:45,200
they are tribal knowledge and it's hard

00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:47,480
to say but it's a fact really yours in

00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,800
order to use them right like that's why

00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,410
we write them we think they're gonna be

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:55,010
helpful so we want them to be used by

00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:57,130
the the piece feature for this wall that

00:47:55,010 --> 00:48:00,770
somehow makes sure they won't be used

00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:02,510
and I think another major problem to

00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:08,870
this is that they really are forever

00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:12,410
they're not gonna you know go away okay

00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:15,140
well so how do we really change this

00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:17,090
prioritization we we want features to be

00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:21,260
used what do we change in order to make

00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:21,980
sure they're used all right let's talk

00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,810
about roadmaps

00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,220
and hopefully by the end of this we'll

00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:27,320
get to how we change

00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:31,460
I love the sentence plan your work work

00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:33,230
your plan and we need we need a road map

00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:34,880
but here's the thing you might have been

00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:36,800
using Pro for a very long time and you

00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,350
would be thinking yeah Perl didn't have

00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,450
a road map Larry worked on Perl to

00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:42,980
produce multiple versions of it in his

00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:44,900
head he was thinking these are things I

00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:48,220
want to introduce these are things that

00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:52,730
I'm gonna tackle is an amazing developer

00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:54,410
and also had numerous users so people

00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:57,170
give a lot of ideas and eventually it

00:48:54,410 --> 00:49:00,410
formed right we also had these changes

00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:01,970
we had Pro one in 87 the next year we

00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:05,210
had Perl 2 then the next year we had

00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:06,740
Perl 3 it was let's say a new version

00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:08,210
even though it was just to rename for a

00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:11,420
book let's ignore that for a moment

00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:14,030
that's that was two years later and then

00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:16,610
three years later we had profile so this

00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:19,720
this was a road map and and things were

00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:22,070
introduced in each version except for so

00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:25,100
this is what we expected haven't we've

00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:28,400
me soon okay we're gonna have this this

00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,710
nice one two three four five and in six

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,140
seven eight nine ten

00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:38,090
that's what languages do but something

00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:39,600
happened Perl 6 happened and I know it's

00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:42,390
an uncomfortable top

00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:45,200
for a lot of people to talk about but I

00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:48,270
think we do need to talk about Perl 6

00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,590
now fro 6 had been renamed rocku so I'm

00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:52,560
going to talk about rock ooh

00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:55,430
okay when I want to evaluate rock ooh I

00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:58,770
think rock we had two goals that changed

00:49:55,430 --> 00:50:02,340
the first one was to be version 6 of

00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:05,280
Perl right the second one was to be

00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:07,290
Bronco version 6 of Perl would just be

00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,920
the next version it would be different

00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:12,840
it would be a lot of things would be new

00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:15,030
in it it would be more capable to have

00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:18,540
more things maybe some changes and then

00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:22,340
rocku is a next-generation language it

00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:25,670
is enviable it is strong it is

00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:28,880
incredibly flexible amazing the grammar

00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:32,040
capabilities just it's something else

00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:35,160
but those are not the same right when we

00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:36,390
look at both of those goals if we're

00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,410
thinking about the next version of Perl

00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:40,410
that didn't pan out

00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:42,960
the reason didn't pan out is simply

00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:44,640
because it succeeded at being a

00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,970
different language that is similar to

00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,440
pro so I don't want to say that rock who

00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:51,660
failed it didn't fail he succeeded in

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,100
doing something else because when they

00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,930
looked into it they realized you know

00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:56,910
this what we really want is like this

00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:58,680
other thing that is very similar but

00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:03,750
really different and he produced

00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:05,430
something incredible it's I am so amazed

00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:07,470
with what they've done you really as if

00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:10,230
you take a look errors for example rocku

00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:12,510
provides errors that are very difficult

00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:15,750
to compare to other languages in in how

00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:18,770
useful they are to the user and its

00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:20,970
capabilities in managing whether it's

00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:23,790
numbers or whether it's strings or

00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:26,040
whether it's an indefinite or infinite

00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:28,350
loops or just all of its asynchronous

00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:30,930
capability it's just incredible so that

00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:34,470
didn't pan out as version 6 a pro that

00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:37,980
didn't that didn't happen so this nice

00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:40,860
really laid out plan had to deal with

00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:42,450
the enemy and then he changed all laid

00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:44,480
out plans had to deal with I mean for

00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:49,440
our for us I think the enemy was just

00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:52,450
time and scope so what we ended up with

00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,339
was just profile and we

00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:56,560
rocku for and so that's not a bad deal

00:51:54,339 --> 00:51:58,089
right but we we just had profile all

00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:00,339
over the plan that's it that's what we

00:51:58,089 --> 00:52:02,619
all had to deal with and we released a

00:52:00,339 --> 00:52:05,079
lot of profiles just went to five ten

00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:08,260
twelve fourteen sixteen oh these all the

00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:14,589
way to 30 and just yet right there

00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:16,869
behind me Saturday we had 532 so we had

00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:18,400
these two roads in version five we said

00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:20,109
okay this has made this mode we're gonna

00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,599
grow this we're gonna create the next

00:52:20,109 --> 00:52:24,040
version and in the next version the idea

00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:25,990
was okay languages grow we need to

00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,089
evolve we're gonna change and we're

00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:30,760
gonna produce version six what would go

00:52:28,089 --> 00:52:33,339
in version 6 and then as we continue to

00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:35,619
realize no this doesn't fit as version 6

00:52:33,339 --> 00:52:36,910
we try to keep it in the name we try and

00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,680
kind of working that out but eventually

00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:41,950
it's not it's on version 6 it's wrong

00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:44,619
it's a different thing so what we ended

00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:47,109
up with is version 5 saying well we

00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:49,240
still need to grow and evolve so now we

00:52:47,109 --> 00:52:52,690
have these two roads and profiles on

00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:55,089
both which produces really funny case

00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:56,410
you know we have a split personally want

00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:56,800
to evolve and want to involve so what do

00:52:56,410 --> 00:53:00,069
we do

00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:02,109
okay well feature guards that's that's a

00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:04,960
simple solution right that's all we need

00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:07,390
to do right but oh hey I forgot with

00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,280
feature girls it's a situation where all

00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:11,290
the universities are making the default

00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,690
the old thing and then having to enable

00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:17,740
everything and then eventually providing

00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:19,300
diminished usage users the benefit about

00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,920
just having everything and then

00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:22,630
providing those that increase the usage

00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,490
the worst experience we can imagine

00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:26,079
because they have to account for all of

00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:29,050
that old stuff and we can remove it and

00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,700
it's just yeah okay so maybe it seems

00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:32,020
like feature guards are the problem I

00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,550
don't want to say it's a problem I think

00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:38,890
the problem is that feature guards are

00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:40,569
permanent I think we can fix it so this

00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:43,270
really is why old feature guards are

00:53:40,569 --> 00:53:47,770
forever they're permanent because every

00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:50,890
version of Perl is version 5 and Pro 6

00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:53,470
had the right idea version 6 needed to

00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:55,540
happen we need to move forward the thing

00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:58,950
is we didn't move forward but we didn't

00:53:55,540 --> 00:54:01,510
enable any of it you put the onus of you

00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:03,339
moving forward on you you have to make

00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:06,450
sure it moves forward you have to turn

00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:10,120
on all of these

00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:13,870
years 18 years you have to move us

00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:15,340
forward so yeah I would say I agree with

00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:18,820
the statement the profile must stay

00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:22,810
profile but I don't think pearl needs to

00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:25,510
stay pro/5 and that means that we knew

00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:29,260
me we need a new major version that's

00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:32,920
that is what we need at this moment now

00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:36,550
I know with this this probably in over

00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:40,920
there on the other side of my webcam you

00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:42,190
have this Oh moment this is gonna be oh

00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:46,750
wow

00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:49,720
and yeah yeah you're right

00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:51,280
so this is our plan this is what we're

00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,670
gonna do what we're gonna do is we're

00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:56,020
gonna jump from five to seven right six

00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,550
was wrong could turn out to be a

00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:59,800
different language that's okay we're

00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:01,570
gonna make leap from five to seven we

00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,550
aren't the only language that did the

00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:05,980
gonna do this bunch of other languages

00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:08,320
that this job and jump versions phb

00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:11,350
specifically moved from five to seven so

00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,790
you know a lot of people make fun of

00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:15,190
these people we have a lot to learn from

00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:16,810
them and we can also move major versions

00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:19,180
similar to how they did it

00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:20,800
now another core concept here that you

00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:22,960
might be seeing is that in one version

00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,030
we could add new features in another

00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,780
major version we can find enable new

00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:33,030
features so I'm nearing the end of my

00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:35,950
talk what does this really mean well so

00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:38,230
Perl is no longer the maintenance by

00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:42,100
default we're leaving that idea behind

00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:43,750
we need to reprioritize first of all

00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,700
feature guards are going to be bound to

00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:48,640
major versions really what they are now

00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:51,220
so in seven it will have different

00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:53,560
feature guards that really means that in

00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:58,210
major versions we promote new defaults

00:55:53,560 --> 00:56:00,640
so if we for example move to seven the

00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:03,430
change so one of the changes we can do

00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:05,560
is and stripping warnings that's just

00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:06,910
any default and the feature guards would

00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,830
be for a feature that we introduced in

00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:10,750
seven seven point two seven point four

00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:13,050
that would use a feature guard but then

00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:15,160
in eight we could enable that

00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:18,130
additionally and this is very very

00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:19,930
important to the reprioritization idea

00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:22,570
is that in major version

00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:25,150
we can finally remove syntax so if we

00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:28,480
disable for example indirect syntax in

00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:29,800
seven in eight theoretically we could

00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,720
removing the right syntax and I know

00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,700
there is one person there that is still

00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,980
writing indirect syntax and demands to

00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:39,370
never change it but you know what that's

00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:41,320
not our top priority right so we can

00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:42,640
finally have better error messages we

00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:47,410
can finally introduce features we have

00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:51,880
to drag behind this weight right now

00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:53,320
seven specifically will be 532 but with

00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,450
a few new defaults we're still

00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,650
discussing which so I'm not gonna say

00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:58,960
all of them I'm gonna say several of

00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:01,540
them some pragmas some features I will

00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,000
say strict and warnings but definitely

00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:06,160
not Unicode semantics so we still need

00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,840
to figure out on the porters list and

00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:12,160
the core developers what we're gonna do

00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:14,200
but some will be enabled pro/5 itself

00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,000
the major version of five will enter a

00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,740
long term support period we're working

00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,680
with distributions we're working with

00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:22,600
open BSD and working with Debian and

00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:25,030
we're trying to figure out is what is a

00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,590
good support window what kind of support

00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:30,070
would they like so we're we are gonna

00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:31,720
have to back port several bug fixes

00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:34,840
security for sure for a very long time

00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:36,460
we're discussing five plus years for

00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:39,970
sure so definitely not you know the

00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:42,010
regular two years that we have and we

00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:44,380
definitely are introducing several paths

00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:47,470
for you to upgrade so you could move

00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:48,880
easily your code where you need to and

00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:51,130
we're also going to introduce

00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,980
compatibility modes for modules so you

00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:55,480
could upload pro 7 code onto Sipan and

00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:57,610
it would be a compatibility module

00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,430
applied so you could actually also use

00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:03,220
it within a profile using the defaults

00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:04,570
of profile all right now if we take a

00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,010
look at the cost benefit analysis and

00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:09,340
this is what I really want you to focus

00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:11,590
on the priorities who are our most

00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:16,180
important users and how you serve them

00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:19,150
best with this change the absentee might

00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:21,190
have a small cost and that is to remove

00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:23,530
corrupt the old code that doesn't it

00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:25,690
shouldn't work anymore if they decide to

00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:28,450
upgrade that means that the experience

00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:30,970
is not that bad for the maintainer and

00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:33,280
the novice or giving them a smaller cost

00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:33,790
they might need once in a while to

00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,550
change something

00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:38,230
that was wrong and that's okay but it's

00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:41,410
a very little cost they don't have to

00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:43,590
start with the ten lines of things to

00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:45,310
enable and disable and turn-on and

00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:45,940
important they don't have to do that

00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:48,670
anymore

00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:50,460
they're blank slate will be the best

00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:52,780
possible pearl that we could produce

00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,160
which is what people want but they pick

00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,930
up a language they're saying give me the

00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,100
language and what we're saying is we're

00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:59,470
gonna give you half of it you're gonna

00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,030
have to enable the rest yourself so not

00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,380
anymore right they're gonna get the best

00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:04,030
one out of the box that I mean to know

00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:05,470
about it and the tribal knowledge none

00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:06,790
of that so they're gonna get the best

00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:08,950
experience that they could write new

00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:11,800
code or they can maintain the code that

00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:13,600
they have in you features all right so

00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:15,250
now you're probably worried really

00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,720
worried what about when things break

00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:18,490
because things will down on the vary the

00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,440
entire world is gonna break that's what

00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:21,250
we think right so okay there are ways to

00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,900
deal with it first

00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:25,780
you could correct your code if your code

00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:27,850
doesn't work on you strict well you know

00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:30,240
what time to join the century time to

00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:33,070
start writing you know correct code and

00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,900
we argue and try to provide some tooling

00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:37,390
for this so if we're gonna enable

00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:39,040
signatures for example in whatever major

00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:42,490
version you're gonna have to change your

00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:45,120
prototype to say : prototype and that is

00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:48,280
a simple tooling that we can introduce

00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:50,140
also you could disable pragmas you could

00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,880
disable features so if start gives you

00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:54,580
warnings you can still write no strict

00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:56,050
you can still write no warnings that's

00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:57,700
fine that will continue your work if

00:59:56,050 --> 01:00:00,220
you're using indirect syntax you could

00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:03,100
say use indirect that will continue to

01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:05,320
work now we're also introducing compact

01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:08,740
modules and what they will do is disable

01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:11,380
or rather revert to that version all at

01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:13,600
once so if you say use compat Pro 5 it's

01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:19,450
basically gonna give you every default

01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:21,880
the Pro 5 had 532 versus 7 oh and of

01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:24,100
course you could always use an older

01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:26,140
version of Perl you know 5 10 is

01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,610
available 5 16 is available whatever you

01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:29,200
wanted to use if you want to use that

01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:30,670
you have to use that that's still

01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,620
available we're only talking about

01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,940
breakage for people who demand to update

01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:35,920
and you know what if you wanna update

01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:39,040
you should update not just the binary

01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:41,170
also sometimes your code so I'm gonna

01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,010
try to present this case as a developer

01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,140
for the people who are the most

01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:47,260
concerned and that this might actually

01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:50,200
impact if you have better

01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:51,910
patterns in your coat and refused to

01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:54,250
update the bat patterns in your code and

01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:55,690
you refused to update your code to note

01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:58,930
that you are using bad patterns

01:00:55,690 --> 01:01:01,420
knowingly and refused to turn on

01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:03,400
compatibility mode to a pro 5 and you

01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:07,360
demand that you or your distribution

01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:11,460
still update the Perl 7 for you then you

01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:13,870
know what you're not gonna be happy but

01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:17,340
and this is this is hard for me to say

01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:22,450
but I think it requires a lot of honesty

01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:25,030
that's okay that that isn't our primary

01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:33,090
target because that code is not gonna

01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:35,530
grow if we look at our users for Naveen

01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:37,240
there yeah definitely Naveen should use

01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:39,250
pro because he gets the best experience

01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:41,680
out of the box no tribal knowledge no

01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:43,720
cargo call no copy-paste better error

01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,640
messages and warnings tooling and

01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:49,090
automatically avoids all the common

01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:50,620
pitfalls for Murray the maintainer it's

01:01:49,090 --> 01:01:52,960
even easier new features available and

01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:54,070
if your major version minor version

01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,870
still have the feature Garth so she

01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:58,150
could turn those on use feature and get

01:01:55,870 --> 01:02:00,400
all this nice features in the sneak

01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:03,040
preview improve tooling and experience

01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,570
and it is rewarding to continuously use

01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:07,840
pearl you don't have to work around

01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:11,230
things anymore for em in the absentee or

01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:14,500
people who use their stuff you don't

01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:17,140
have to use pearl anymore but some

01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:19,600
things might have to change you could

01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:21,070
apply patches if Anna wrote stuff that

01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,680
is on a distribution distribution will

01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:25,720
update it for you that's not a problem

01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:27,850
but if you are using Anna's code

01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:29,500
directly then you could apply the

01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:31,270
patches or you can bring an in to apply

01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,250
the patches or hire someone to apply

01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:35,290
them that's okay new functionality can

01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:36,790
still be disabled manually all the

01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:38,050
versions bro can still be installed and

01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:40,540
used if you want to use Anna's code

01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:42,400
forever and never change it install that

01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:44,320
version and pro for that use it it's

01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,180
okay we do that with other things pro

01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:50,560
should start joining the other languages

01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:53,230
in its game now what's the timeline we

01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:56,020
intend to release 7-0 in under one year

01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:58,240
that is the official timeline what we

01:02:56,020 --> 01:03:00,630
actually intend to do is try to get it

01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:03,000
out of the door in less than half a year

01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:04,050
what capabilities will pro 7 include I'm

01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,310
sure you're wondering I'm sure you

01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:08,160
really want to see whether the new

01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:11,220
snazzy stuff nothing you get no new

01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,930
capabilities it's gonna be exactly 532

01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:16,230
except we're gonna enable a few things

01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:18,840
no new features there's still plenty of

01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:20,490
work to do we need to update all of the

01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:22,140
core code we need to update the intern

01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:24,270
library code need to update the interim

01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,560
tooling we need to review all of the

01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:27,660
agreements order be accounted for in

01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,490
different versions and I want to

01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:31,020
overhaul the documentation at least have

01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:32,490
a plan for it because the documentation

01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:34,490
really represents how we see the

01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:36,960
language how we want it to be used

01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:39,150
you're welcome to join the effort

01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,130
there's the p5p mailing list there is

01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:43,470
also github you can reach out to me and

01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:45,300
two other core developers and I'd like

01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:47,820
to thank you very very much for

01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:50,760
attending for listening I hope you still

01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:55,700
there because I can't see you enjoy the

01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:55,700
rest of the conference we have a few

01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:06,599
alright guys sorry can you hear me yes

01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:09,329
we have a few questions you want are you

01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:11,220
up for some questions sure if we have

01:04:09,329 --> 01:04:13,280
the time yes absolutely I can't promise

01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:19,349
I'm gonna answer them well or at all

01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:21,180
okay we'll start with Curtis I this

01:04:19,349 --> 01:04:24,420
isn't a question it's just a count for a

01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:28,109
number of other folks this doesn't break

01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:29,670
anything in Perl that's the main thing

01:04:28,109 --> 01:04:31,950
which I think a lot of the detractors

01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:34,440
are going to be concerned about there is

01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:38,460
nothing in this which breaks anything in

01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:43,160
Perl if you stay on Perl 5 you're fine

01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:47,819
there is no issue there it's if you

01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:52,109
decide to go to Pearl 7 for 8 or beyond

01:04:47,819 --> 01:04:55,349
and wherever you go and you happen to

01:04:52,109 --> 01:04:57,510
write Perl that is problematic then yes

01:04:55,349 --> 01:05:00,270
you might have some issues if you want

01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:02,609
your code to continue running correctly

01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:06,710
and you want to complete running

01:05:02,609 --> 01:05:10,410
correctly under 5 there's no issue none

01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:15,200
so just please keep that in mind so no

01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:15,200
questions is to come it okay Michael

01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:25,170
actually I didn't have a question that

01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:26,870
was Oh quite a while yo so okay thanks

01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:35,880
thanks Michael

01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:42,660
salad yeah hey couldn't hear you can

01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:48,090
also I saw her just quickly why not just

01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:52,080
jump to version 32 and then show the

01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:56,720
world that things have happened this is

01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:56,720
where we are we're still continuing and

01:05:57,710 --> 01:06:04,470
that's it's just a higher number

01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:08,760
basically yeah so my answer to this is

01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:10,770
that other than thinking that 32 is a

01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:13,920
terrible number to jump to because it's

01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:16,740
just too big I think it's also bringing

01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,750
more confusion into this 7 particularly

01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:20,580
is not very important really what I'm

01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:24,420
looking for is Perl eight to be honest

01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:26,370
so the the goal is to just start with a

01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:28,680
number but I think that number still has

01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:32,190
to make sense and I think dropping the

01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:33,690
32 is still the whole issue of version 5

01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:35,580
because we're still keeping you know

01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:38,430
it's it's Pro 5 so we're gonna drop the

01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:40,560
the 5 we're gonna keep the 32 but da is

01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:43,320
that five Woods never never meant to

01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:44,940
stay 5 forever it meant to go to 6 and

01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:47,160
we have rock ooh that's great

01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:48,810
but that means that ok not sick so it's

01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,960
just a move move on to the next one

01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:54,480
anything it's very important to

01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,710
disassociate the version number from the

01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,070
previous version numbers that we're

01:06:55,710 --> 01:07:00,660
talking about like 5 & 6 so I think 32

01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:04,770
is just too big of a jump and it's

01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:09,990
harder to follow 32 34 35 it's easy to

01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:13,910
follow 7 8 9 and eventually the

01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:13,910
developers willing will reach 32

01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:25,850
okay next we have Mike hello so one of

01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:28,910
the questions that I saw in chat was

01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:30,440
related to named named arguments and

01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:33,140
function and function in subroutine

01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:36,200
signatures I know that right now that

01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:37,910
still yields an experimental warning and

01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:40,330
I'm wondering if the plan for Perl seven

01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:43,220
involves taking those things that have

01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:44,780
so far been considered experimental and

01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:46,910
bringing those into Perl seven with us

01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:48,530
or if we're just talking about the stuff

01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:51,020
that's not throwing an experimental

01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:54,380
warning right now in our first foray and

01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:55,660
of course the end of Perl seven and then

01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:59,840
I'm wondering

01:07:55,660 --> 01:08:03,410
within each major version number of Perl

01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:05,300
seven is like are we going to have Perl

01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:06,380
seven and then anything that happens at

01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:09,440
that point is going to be a feature

01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:11,690
guard and then on version eight we

01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,400
remove all the future guards and then

01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:17,600
keep on everything is is it gonna be

01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:18,770
ratcheting up like that right so it's

01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,850
easier for me to answer the second

01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:23,000
question first

01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:25,970
yes the goal is that we moved to seven

01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:29,600
and then you'll get everything will come

01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:31,310
into play so let's say the 533 one which

01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,160
we should have had now we're gonna have

01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:36,740
as seven point one right and what it

01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:39,859
would have been 534 is actually going to

01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:41,480
be seven point eight so the goal is for

01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:43,339
everything that comes in within the

01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:45,140
major version you would have to use use

01:08:43,339 --> 01:08:47,750
feature because the major version should

01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:50,930
not ever introduced syntax that you

01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:53,720
didn't request but the idea is that if

01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:55,609
we wrote this feature we want you to use

01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:57,770
it and we think you should so in eight

01:08:55,609 --> 01:09:00,170
it will be enabled by default having

01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:02,299
said that there are a set of existing

01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:04,220
features which we cannot wholesale

01:09:02,299 --> 01:09:06,589
enable we just can't it would be

01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:08,750
disastrous it will be worse than Python

01:09:06,589 --> 01:09:11,210
3 and the difficulty that they've had

01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:15,859
with this so we're gonna have to be very

01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:18,980
judicious to either remove keep guarded

01:09:15,859 --> 01:09:20,930
forever or slowly introduce things that

01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:22,880
currently exist but for all the new

01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:24,680
stuff the goal is to write it so we will

01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:27,049
be using will be by default in abled in

01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:28,230
the next major version as for signatures

01:09:27,049 --> 01:09:30,520
specifically

01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:32,739
there are a few perspectives here I'm

01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:34,449
gonna share two the first one is the

01:09:32,739 --> 01:09:37,270
person who's writing the signature

01:09:34,449 --> 01:09:38,500
implementation is Dave Mitchell who is

01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:41,080
amazing

01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:43,029
he's incredible and dave has a lot of

01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:46,210
plans for signatures and they're really

01:09:43,029 --> 01:09:48,580
really spectacular and the reason that

01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:49,060
this was experimental is just because of

01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:55,020
that

01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:59,020
now moving it to seven point two or

01:09:55,020 --> 01:10:01,480
seven even 7.0 sorry moving in 7.0

01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:02,860
though will depend heavily on what else

01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:04,930
is planned for it because we might need

01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:07,719
to keep it experimental on the other

01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:10,030
hand my goal is actually to put in 7.0

01:10:07,719 --> 01:10:12,489
because I am actually looking forward

01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:14,469
for seven point two seven point four

01:10:12,489 --> 01:10:17,469
seven point six one of those to

01:10:14,469 --> 01:10:19,210
introduce the core PM that Ovid Curtis

01:10:17,469 --> 01:10:20,800
Poe has been working on and if we're

01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:23,830
able to do that that means that at eight

01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:26,530
point zero you will have a very capable

01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:28,780
strong object-oriented syntax out of the

01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:31,930
box so you'd have something better than

01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:34,210
moose that draws a lot from moose right

01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:36,340
but better than that in core in eight

01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:38,469
point zero but to do that we would have

01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:40,150
to bring in signatures unless we're

01:10:38,469 --> 01:10:43,510
bringing both signatures and core p.m.

01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:47,650
in eight point zero so still not sure

01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:50,650
about that okay and we have a lot of

01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:52,270
hands up but unfortunately we've have

01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:53,710
sessions that are going to be starting

01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:55,750
in about five minutes

01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:58,150
Sawyer would you be up for attending it

01:10:55,750 --> 01:11:01,810
birds of feather later today or tomorrow

01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:03,520
morning what works best for you tomorrow

01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:05,260
morning is good I think tomorrow morning

01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:08,020
will give us more time and it would be

01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:10,060
more lucid I don't know wouldn't win

01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:11,949
with tonight B so how about we stay in

01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:15,070
touch a little bit just right after and

01:11:11,949 --> 01:11:18,219
see when tonight is I think though and

01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:21,100
and just like I told others go to see I

01:11:18,219 --> 01:11:24,340
see hallway and and we can make a plan

01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:26,560
there you guys can do that together

01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:28,360
well thank you very much for speaking we

01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:31,750
guys we'll see you guys in the next

01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:33,910
sessions the each session will end and

01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:36,219
then you can go into sked and get the

01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:37,750
link for the next session everybody

01:11:36,219 --> 01:11:39,190
should have the password that send zoom

01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:40,789
already it's the same as you've already

01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:42,919
used

01:11:40,789 --> 01:11:45,309
okay we'll see you soon thank you for

01:11:42,919 --> 01:11:45,309
