	Are you typing Data::Dumper-Dump (or similar code) manually to debug? There's help!

okay so this is just about two simple

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,340
little apples so we have a small truck

00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:15,059
and we want to be back on what's in the

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:20,130
data - and if we called it with - mm

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,750
data dumper we get this dalawa one we

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,619
don't have the variable name we don't

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:31,309
have to file any more line and I think

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:35,340
it was around 2000 405 when we had a

00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:38,190
production model out at work and shortly

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,320
after a system administrator was coming

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,280
to the developers office and said hey

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,730
our dogs are running full and soon we

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,969
won't have any disk space anymore

00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:53,129
so we had to find someone had forgotten

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,649
this debugging statement and it was not

00:00:53,129 --> 00:01:03,840
easy to find it just correcting for dump

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:06,030
oh yeah wasn't really easy so I want the

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,280
package name and the line number and the

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:14,790
variable name and so how does this look

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:20,369
like so here we have the package and

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:29,340
line and data and so this is already

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:35,780
much better but of course there are some

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:39,000
problems so rotted leaves are random so

00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:45,299
we like to separate it on for sort keys

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,369
and also it's a lot to type right but I

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:53,970
can actually do this I track the

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:57,119
variable name and backslash feeding and

00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:02,630
bear this so that's a simple goodnight

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:07,009
thing and it also works for scalars so

00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,009
here we have the multi-line string

00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:14,200
and so that's the multi-line string with

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:18,250
trailing spaces as you can actually see

00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:24,370
here hopefully but I don't think the

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:30,190
training spaces now we have trained with

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:33,190
caps and I don't really see the caps so

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:46,330
I want something new and some of you

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:49,180
know that I like you so let's convert

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:56,080
the multi-line string and I try it

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:59,410
backstage right and I get this now you

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,900
can see the package design run with a

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:07,050
variable name and a yellow document and

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,050
it marks the lines with trailing spaces

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:14,950
and if you have caps or control

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,250
characters in it then it automatically

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:30,370
uses double quotes and you can see the

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:33,040
test and if we dump the hash um I think

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:36,910
that blue might be very dark so I'm not

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,540
sure if you can read it but um yeah

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,110
let's try it

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:47,920
so here the keys are all sorted and here

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:52,260
we have an object and a red X and also

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:58,570
Perl code is dumped and highlighted so

00:03:52,260 --> 00:04:01,690
yeah the first mapping saves me already

00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,000
a lot of time when we packing I really

00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,980
don't want to miss it

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,760
but sometimes highlighted code can

00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:14,709
actually be much more readable and this

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:17,289
you can find this in a branch in this

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:20,080
repository and twelve are my doc files

00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:22,739
and I wish you happy debugging that's it

00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,739
