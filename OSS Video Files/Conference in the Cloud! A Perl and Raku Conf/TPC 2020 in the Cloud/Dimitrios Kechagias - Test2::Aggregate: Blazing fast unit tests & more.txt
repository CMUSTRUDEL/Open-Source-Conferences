Description: 
	An intro to Test2::Aggregate, an aggregator module that can work with any test framework, particularly Test2::Suite, with the potential to dramatically increase the speed of tests - especially large volumes of small unit tests. There will be a focus on how to start integrating the module into a test suite without disrupting the workflow, how it can benefit your CI pipeline and how to deal with various caveats of aggregation. Additionally, various other ways to use the module will be presented, such as profiling, testing flakiness / finding conflicts, generating reports, testing aggregation etc.
