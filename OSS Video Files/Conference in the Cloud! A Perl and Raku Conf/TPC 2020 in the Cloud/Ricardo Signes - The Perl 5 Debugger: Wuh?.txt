Description: 
	95% of all debugging is print statements, but once or twice a year, a problem shows up that is best attached with perl5db.pl, the venerable core Perl 5 debugger. Like a light saber, it dates back to a forgotten time and its operations are poorly understood. Unlike a light saber, it is not elegant, and nobody aspires to use it. Also, it can cut limbs right off. Still, itâ€™s a very useful multi-purpose tool, and if you learn how to use it, it can save a lot of time and clear up a lot of mysteries.

This talk will cover what the debugger is, how to use it at a basic and intermediate level, how to customize it, and at least one or two stories about how it is very, very awful.
