Knowing
Is your system slow, or only under certain circumstances or with specific request? OpenTracing and ‘Distributed Tracing’ may be helpful to understand what is going on.

Introduction to OpenTracing
From the OpenTracing.IO website:

Distributed tracing, also called distributed request tracing, is a method used to profile and monitor applications, especially those built using a microservices architecture. Distributed tracing helps pinpoint where failures occur and what causes poor performance.

OpenTracing is comprised of an API specification, frameworks and libraries that have implemented the specification, and documentation for the project. OpenTracing allows developers to add instrumentation to their application code using APIs that do not lock them into any one particular product or vendor.

Perl5 and OpenTracing
With an increasing number of Framework Plugins and Integrations, it becomes more and more easy for Application Developers to add instrumentation to an existing (web) application.

These Plugins only have a limited responsibility: to bootstrap a OpenTracing compliant Implementation.

Integrations, on the one hand, need to be capable to extract (implementation specific) tracer information from in incoming request, or, on the other hand, inject that information into an outgoing request to a (micro) service and other sub-systems.

Being ‘open’ or agnostic about third party tracing software services, also means that for each of those there needs to be a specific Implementation.

Some Integration solutions are readily available, others will require more development.

The OpenTracing Perl5 SDK
To make your task as a developer more easy, there are various tools available, most important the OpenTracing Interface POD. And as long as you keep your development stick to those API specifications, life is good. But there are Types and Test to help building compliant Integrations and Implementations.
