Description: 
	Classification of types of autonomous testing: - Types of functionality recognition/code generation + Discovery/rules-based + Pattern-recognition-based + Combinatorial-based - Types of testing: + Regression + Discovery

How do different types of systems under test affect tests support? What types of autonomous tests are one-off and what types are supportable.

Will walk through use cases for each type and when they are applicable. Talk about cases where all of them are not applicable. How autonomous testing can be integrated into CI/CD. Where integration to CD is possible and where it is not possible.

Youâ€™ll see different examples in practice.
