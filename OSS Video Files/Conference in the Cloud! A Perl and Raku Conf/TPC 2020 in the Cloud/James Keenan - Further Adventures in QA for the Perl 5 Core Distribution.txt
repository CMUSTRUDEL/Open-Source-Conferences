Title: James Keenan - Further Adventures in QA for the Perl 5 Core Distribution
Publication date: 2020-06-25
Playlist: TPC 2020 in the Cloud
Description: 
	As compilers like gcc and clang advance, they probe deeper for weaknesses in source code, generating additional build-time warnings.  These enable Perl 5 contributors to write more accurate and portable code.  In this talk we discuss tools we have written in the past year to identify such warnings.
