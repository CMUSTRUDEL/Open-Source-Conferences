Title: Hassiba 'Bennie' Bendali - Music and Software Management: Skill Transfer
Publication date: 2020-06-24
Playlist: TPC 2020 in the Cloud
Description: 
	Public speaking. Team management. Efficiency. Problem Solving. Leadership. All these terms commonly refer to the workplace, and for most people, they are a challenge.
These same words apply to the orchestra. Musicians deal with and solve these issues on a daily basis. What can we learn from them?

An orchestra is usually given as the perfect example of harmony. Very different instruments, sometimes very far from one another, a different music sheet, and yet, unity is achieved. Music is made, and it’s beautiful. Achieving this harmony is not easy, and requires a lot of work from everyone. Being a good musician is not enough. Being able to listen to the other musicians, focusing, following the conductor during rehearsals and on concert night, managing stage fright; all these steps are necessary, and by no means easy. Yet, musicians do it every day. The qualities they develop can be transferred to the work place: solving conflicts, overcoming the fear of public speaking, managing opposite points of view and personalities, creating a positive relationship between a manager and his team… There is lot to learn from the orchestra!

thank you for joining this talk so today

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,090
I'm not gonna be showing you any code

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,740
this is not a technical talk at all

00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,630
we'll be talking about classical music

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,990
and the lessons that we can learn from

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,630
the way an orchestra works and from the

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,140
relationship between the musicians and

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,019
the conductor so let's get started

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,490
first I don't know how many of you have

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,670
been to a concert given by an orchestra

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,030
but it always starts in the same way so

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,440
the musician come on the stage sit

00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:38,040
everyone Tunes their instrument and then

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,860
they wait in silence then the conductor

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,860
enters everyone stands up he gets to his

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,890
spot vows to the audience and then sits

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,489
the orchestra and after that all he has

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,760
to do is wave his baton and magically

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,500
the music starts so of course the

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,600
conductor is a great way to illustrate

00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,489
the concept of leadership and there are

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,850
quite a few things that have been said

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,979
about conducting and leadership so what

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,960
I would like to talk about today is not

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,770
just about that we will first talk about

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,540
the orchestra how does it work

00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:17,340
independently of the conductor and then

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:20,400
we will circle back to the conductor so

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,500
we might think that finding your place

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,270
in an orchestra is easy because it

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,610
basically it's your instrument that

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,020
tells you where you're going and where

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,960
you're gonna sit and what you're going

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,150
to play but once you're there you

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,329
actually have to fit in and this is

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:40,229
where the real work begins so to give

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:43,530
you an idea here is a picture of an

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:47,100
orchestra and actually I am in this

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,820
picture somewhere and let's see I think

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,590
I'm around here like behind this guy I

00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,850
mean the first violin section and as you

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,520
can tell it's it's pretty much

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,110
impossible to spot me so the first thing

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,630
to accept when you're joining an

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,880
orchestra is that you will just be a

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:08,520
tiny part of something that's gonna be

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:11,459
way way bigger than you so now you can

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,690
see the link that we can make between a

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,630
work environment and the orchestra

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,850
imagine that musicians practice their

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,490
skills for years and then the audition

00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,980
and the audition is very competitive and

00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,020
in the same way in a work environment

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,810
while you studied you worked hard you

00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:32,260
got the job and now you have to fit in

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:35,440
and your ability to fit in is just as

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,690
important as your qualifications so if

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,150
you think about you know your manager

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,130
crushing your creativity think about a

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,790
musician who's been trained for years to

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:49,320
develop his style - to develop his skill

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:53,580
as an interpreter only to give them up

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:56,560
well of course it's really not that bad

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,140
actually the creativity of the musician

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,510
is still there it's just directed in a

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:06,400
certain way and it's still valued and

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:08,800
extremely useful but you cannot have 150

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,660
people being creative each of them in

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,080
their own way all this creativity needs

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:16,780
to be directed in one direction so the

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,959
question is not what works for me as an

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,150
individual and as an artist it the

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,489
question is what matters what works for

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,920
the orchestra and more specifically what

00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:30,459
works for this specific piece that we're

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,220
working on so on top of your own skill

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:36,520
your ability to listen and adapt is

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,530
really what is at stake and that brings

00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,260
me to my second point which is what are

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,510
rehearsals for and if we think about it

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:48,550
in especially in classical music the

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:50,830
music itself is very detailed of course

00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,780
the music itself is clear clearly

00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,900
written but it also have very specific

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,000
indications on how to play so we may ask

00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,610
ourselves okay what do we do in

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,110
rehearsal what's the point

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,000
well it's something that actually took

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,850
me a while to understand as a musician

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,519
myself but rehearsals are really for a

00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:12,160
musician the way to learn the other

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,370
musicians parts he doesn't go to

00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,950
rehearsals for himself he goes for the

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,380
others and during rehearsals he does not

00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:23,280
practice his own part he focuses on

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:27,320
learning what the others are doing and

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:32,810
that's absolutely absolutely essential

00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:36,470
if we go back to this picture okay so do

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:39,380
you think that the person that's here is

00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:43,010
going to hear what the upright bass on

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,300
the other side of the stage is doing or

00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:46,280
do you think that the percussionist

00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,080
somewhere here in front of the choir do

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,880
you think they're listening to the viola

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,300
or that they can even hear what the

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,410
viola is playing and you think that

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,570
anyone can hear anything when the

00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,250
trombones are playing no we can't of

00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:01,550
course the trombones are playing that's

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:03,440
that's all we're gonna hear so it's it's

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,510
absolutely critical to know the other

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,490
people's part to know what they're doing

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:11,720
and not just your own that's not enough

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:14,180
and during rehearsal the conductor will

00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,710
focus on one group at a time he will

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,440
work with the musicians to create

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:21,500
balance so that when it's time for the

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,140
performance we know exactly where to

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:28,010
place our focus and you can imagine that

00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:30,500
in a an hour-long performance the focus

00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,300
shifts a lot and of course I'm just

00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,430
talking about instruments I'm not even

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,520
talking about changes in tempo which is

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:40,700
the speed of the music and again we need

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,760
to be constantly aware of what is

00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:47,690
happening around us so knowing our own

00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,640
part is not enough we have to know our

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,340
part well enough so that we can distance

00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:56,090
ourselves from it and pay attention to

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:58,850
the other musicians and to the conductor

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,520
himself so that's what rehearsals are

00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,960
for and again I encourage you I wanted

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,640
to show you actually during this

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,910
presentation I wanted to show you some

00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,830
videos on YouTube but we try that and

00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,900
that did not really work well with the

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:15,320
YouTube streaming going at the same time

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:17,290
so I would encourage you if this is a

00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,380
topic that interests you to watch

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:24,170
recordings of orchestras doing live

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,820
performances and usually you have

00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,360
close-ups of the camera on different

00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,460
sections of the of the orchestra and if

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,310
you look particularly at the string

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,940
section so the violins the violas the

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,120
cellos

00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,849
you will see that they play most of the

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,619
time and for the main most famous Orcas

00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:45,199
stress they play in the exact same way

00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:47,240
they use sometimes it's very impressive

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,240
to see cuz they use the exact same

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,539
length of their bow for each single note

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,789
it's it is very impressive to be able to

00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:58,909
achieve that to achieve this complete

00:06:55,789 --> 00:07:01,879
unity of a group of people playing just

00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:04,099
like one person and you really hear just

00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,199
one sound there is one sound for the

00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:08,749
first violin one sound for second violin

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,689
you do not hear a group of people you

00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:13,580
just hear one voice it is very

00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:17,240
impressive and that's something that we

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:20,509
can only achieve through rehearsal so

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,610
the main other benefits of rehearsal

00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:25,789
that we gain from there from rehearsal

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:29,269
is the ability to manage stage fright

00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:31,639
and stage fright is something that most

00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:33,319
people suffer from I don't believe I've

00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,050
ever met anyone who doesn't feel any

00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:39,199
stress at all when they have to face an

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,769
audience and in a normal life or in a

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,809
normal work environment you can avoid

00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:46,639
speaking in public if you really hate

00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:49,159
that if you're a musician you're gonna

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,050
have to deal with being on a stage being

00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:53,269
the center of attention and having an

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,839
entire audience looking at you and

00:07:53,269 --> 00:08:00,529
listening to you so the question is how

00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:03,289
you deal with it drugs no of course not

00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:07,369
who said drugs no practice of course the

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:09,619
answer is practice the closer we get to

00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:11,990
the performance and the more the

00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:15,259
rehearsal looks and sounds like the

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,089
actual performance so to be good at that

00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:19,909
to be good at public performance or

00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:21,339
public speaking well you have to perform

00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:24,889
in public you have to speak in public

00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:28,249
there's really no other way of course

00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:31,779
one big element to focus on when dealing

00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:35,419
with stage fright is the breathing deep

00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:38,360
regular breathing I know personally it's

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,060
the last thing I do before going before

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,880
entering the stage just take one or two

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:48,410
minutes to just breathe slowly and

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:50,630
deeply and that helps a lot now I know

00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,510
that many of us see stage fright as a

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,590
curse and I've had my share of

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,570
performances

00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,690
partially ruined by stage fright I will

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:02,270
admit but I also would like to share a

00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,940
personal anecdote so before I do that

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,890
let me see do we have any questions or

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:11,030
anything I cannot see that okay it's

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:14,300
fine I'll just continue so yes personal

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:17,090
experience I was working on a piece I

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,340
was a music student and I was working on

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:22,700
a piece for the examination that I had

00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:24,500
at the end of each year and the piece

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,860
that I had that year was actually not

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,670
that hard it was not easy per se but it

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,890
was well within my abilities at the time

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:36,620
so I practiced and when the time came I

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:39,380
was perfectly ready I knew the whole

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,960
piece no problem I was really confident

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,960
that it would go well so I walked on the

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:48,230
stage that day and I had no stage fright

00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,480
at all I just fell good I mean I knew

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,020
the piece I felt good so guess what

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,980
happened

00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:57,890
I failed of course I started making

00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,530
mistakes and while I was wondering why I

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:02,750
made them I was making more mistakes and

00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:05,840
it was just a very unpleasant experience

00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:09,020
and and a very humbling one at the same

00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:12,230
time so once all the anger and

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,240
frustration had passed I quickly

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:18,230
understood what happened I was just not

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,630
focused so stage fright we may hate it

00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:24,890
but stage fright actually forces us to

00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:26,510
focus on our task and and in that way it

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,660
is really a blessing if you walk

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:31,880
confidently on the stage but you have no

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,760
stage fright at all you're probably

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,850
doing something wrong so don't try to

00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,610
avoid stage fright it needs to be there

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,590
because it is a reminder that yes you

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,120
need to focus cause a lot of people will

00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:47,360
be looking at you and you only get one

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,240
shot so that's that's really important

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,890
so to sum up what I would say on on

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,200
stage fright whether it is from

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,330
musicians or for anyone that has to

00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,470
speak in public really the first thing

00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:03,350
that matters is practice and when

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:06,110
musicians have to perform for a concert

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,769
usually before the concert they will do

00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,379
public performances

00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:13,410
or public rehearsals to get used to that

00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:17,339
feeling of having the audience not being

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:19,529
able to stop and just being able to

00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,269
learn to deal with that focus and maybe

00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:24,660
the little shaking of the hand that goes

00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:27,299
with it we just learn to deal with it

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,149
and to manage it and the other thing

00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:33,170
very important is the breathing I highly

00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:35,579
recommend if you're an anxious person

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,829
i-i'm-i'm end meditation in general for

00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:40,799
everyone but especially when you're

00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:43,679
about to go speak in public or give a

00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:46,739
public performance of any kind just a

00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:51,540
few deep breaths and it makes a big big

00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:53,189
difference so we talked about stage

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,439
fright should we avoid it no we should

00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:57,959
not we should embrace stage fright

00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:59,819
because it actually if we learn how to

00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,689
manage it it actually makes us better

00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:06,860
musicians and better public speakers so

00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:10,139
let's go back to our beloved conductors

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,899
conducting is an exercise of leadership

00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:15,360
that is absolutely true but to be more

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,329
specific it's actually both an exercise

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,329
of leadership and an exercise of

00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:24,029
management leadership gives a direction

00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:25,889
and vision so the whole Orchestra is

00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:28,439
going in the same direction and giving

00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:30,749
the same interpretation of the piece as

00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:33,319
opposed to a hundred musicians each

00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:35,790
giving their own interpretation and

00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:37,980
management on the other hand is dealing

00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,660
with the day-to-day with the rehearsals

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,579
with the conflicts and problems that

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,819
arise and as you can imagine an

00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:46,470
orchestra is a large group of people

00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:49,410
often with very strong personalities and

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:52,499
dealing with conflicts is also something

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:56,009
that a conductor needs to be able to do

00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:58,730
to be a good conductor and to give in

00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:01,709
the end to give a successful performance

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:04,739
so a good conductor basically needs to

00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:06,749
be good at both tasks now the question

00:13:04,739 --> 00:13:10,769
is of course how does the conductor

00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:14,790
achieve that the first element is really

00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:17,459
knowledge obviously as a conductor I

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:20,040
don't need to know how to play every

00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:21,780
single instrument in my orchestra of

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,410
course not

00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:28,800
but I need to know enough about each

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:31,410
single instrument to know if a

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,990
particular flute solo is going to be

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,240
very difficult technically or and if the

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:39,030
flutist will need extra attention at

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,380
this moment or if some cue is a little

00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:44,670
hard to hear

00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:46,770
so the gesture from the conductor will

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,840
need to be extra clear because the music

00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,840
itself will not give enough cue to the

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,840
musicians so it's really being able to

00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:58,710
see all that and to understand each

00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:02,670
group each section in their own problems

00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:04,350
in their own difficulties so the

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,240
conductor needs enough knowledge to have

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,400
a basic understanding of what the

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,080
musicians are doing and if we transfer

00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,600
that situation to the workplace we can

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,090
easily see that a manager is not a

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,120
technical person that's not what we want

00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:21,150
from him but he has in his team very

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:25,290
technical people so how does does this

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:27,180
relationship work the manager does not

00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,850
need to know every single detail he does

00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:33,930
not need to be as technical as the most

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:36,030
technical person on the team but he

00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:38,430
needs to know enough to make the correct

00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:42,360
decisions that means of course correct

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:44,970
training but mostly it means excellent

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,160
communication and communication can be

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,530
achieved only if there's absolute

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,530
respect between both parties

00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:55,380
so yes the conductor is the one facing

00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:58,470
the audience but he's well aware that he

00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:00,540
is not the one actually making the music

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,940
and the best relationships that you have

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,520
in orchestras between the orchestra and

00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,470
the conductor is when the conductor

00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,630
understands that he understands that

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:12,200
know the music does not magically

00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:15,480
appears when he waves his baton it

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,930
appears because the musicians all agree

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:23,010
to follow him and that makes a big big

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:26,430
difference so so far I've been talking

00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:28,380
about like the ideal conductor so again

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,990
I really encourage you to take a look at

00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,430
conductors during performances and you

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,040
can see how they communicate with the

00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:37,829
orchestra basically you have to

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,540
so I'm just gonna go over really to like

00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:46,170
main really broad categories of

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:49,860
conductors so the the first one is the

00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:52,980
very like commending type of conductor

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,560
it's the cliche conductor who does huge

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:58,560
movement with his baton and he's usually

00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,959
completely soaked in his own sweat at

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,790
the end of the performance and it's like

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,459
he I don't know climbed a mountain or

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:08,399
something so we usually make fun of this

00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:10,470
kind of conductor but they're still they

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,980
they are very good musicians now the

00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,930
question is are they actually successful

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:19,589
conductors and I will give the example

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:22,740
here of a conductor that was with the

00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:28,019
Scala in Milan named Riccardo Muti and

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:30,449
riccardo muti is a very commanding type

00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:34,889
of directors so with his baton he gives

00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:40,170
very very clear indication of who should

00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:41,940
play and when now it is the problem with

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,490
this kind of Direction is that it is a

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:47,579
little too much and it doesn't give any

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,870
room for the musicians to actually make

00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:53,699
their own decisions they're just

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:57,899
expected to blindly follow whatever the

00:16:53,699 --> 00:17:01,529
conductor is doing and it kind of takes

00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:04,470
the interpretation away from them now

00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:07,350
mooches explanation on his style of

00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:10,380
conducting was that he set for example

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:12,990
on a Don Giovanni production of Don

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,020
Giovanni that he was conducting he said

00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:19,559
that he was I quote responsible for

00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,449
Mozart's so it's really his job as a

00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:24,179
conductor to make sure that the music of

00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:26,459
Mozart is properly played and if it's

00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:28,530
not properly played it's on him it's his

00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,390
fault and therefore he needs to be a

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:33,510
hundred percent in charge of every

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:36,299
single thing every single detail every

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:39,659
single musician in his orchestra so of

00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:41,640
course that's his point of view the

00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:43,440
musicians of the Scala had a different

00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,470
point of view and they actually wrote

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,519
him a letter saying that they really

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:52,440
liked him but they would like him to

00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:55,230
because it was really not working and he

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,539
was not giving any room to them to

00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,769
actually just express themselves which

00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:03,720
is what you're supposed to do as a

00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:06,059
musician so that's it for mutti he he

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,519
went on with his life but at the Scala

00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:10,649
it did not quite work out because he was

00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:13,830
too commanding too much too much

00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:17,460
authority basically the second type is

00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:19,470
the type that I would call a partner or

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,960
the conductor that really establishes a

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:26,850
partnership between himself and the

00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:29,100
orchestra and to start so on this slide

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,299
I put a picture of Leonard Bernstein and

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,059
I will be talking a little bit more

00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:36,779
about him but before that I would like

00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:40,049
to talk about to just quote carry on

00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:43,889
which was another very famous conductor

00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:46,970
and he said the worst damage I can do is

00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:49,769
give indications that are too clear

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:55,080
because it prevents the musicians to

00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:57,240
listen and work as an ensemble so that's

00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,519
a completely different take and that's

00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,279
really here we have a conductor that

00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:05,330
really understands that there cannot be

00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,980
beautiful music if the musicians are not

00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:10,440
responsible completely responsible for

00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,549
making that beautiful music which means

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,490
of course they need to play their part

00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:17,369
very well but they also need to be aware

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,320
of each other and listen to each other

00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:20,700
and not just go from their music to the

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,710
conductor to their music to the

00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,559
conductor and just look at the conductor

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:28,129
all the time listening is absolutely

00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:31,529
essential but if you have a very

00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:33,419
authoritative and commanding type of

00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:36,169
conducting you cannot pay attention you

00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:38,820
cannot listen all your focus will be on

00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:43,860
looking at the conductor and not missing

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:46,049
the cue so the basically the idea with

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,409
the partnership type is that the

00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:51,779
conductor knows when to exercise his his

00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:54,450
authority because Authority is needed

00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:56,340
musicians are not I mean they make

00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,889
mistakes they miss cues they play the

00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:02,250
wrong notes it happens so they need to

00:19:58,889 --> 00:20:03,660
have the

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,370
to have someone that's in a position of

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,020
authority that will tell them look you

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,630
made a mistake pay attention

00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,240
so Authority is needed but it's not

00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,730
enough to actually make people your

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,950
partner so the conductor's job is

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:21,300
basically to know when to step in and

00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:22,950
when to step back and there is one

00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,400
example again that I wish I could show

00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:30,890
you with Leonard Bernstein where he

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:37,470
actually steps back completely and he

00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:38,970
conducts the orchestra with his face so

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,940
if you go on YouTube and you actually

00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,890
type Leonard Bernstein conducting with

00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,560
no hands or something like that you will

00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:48,660
find the video it's him conducting a

00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,300
heightened Symphony and at the very end

00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:54,420
of the symphony he just lets go crosses

00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:58,020
his arms and then just looks and just by

00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:01,440
looks and mimics with his head gives

00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:04,530
cues but mostly just steps back and let

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,800
the musicians enjoy themselves and give

00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:09,450
the performance and it's absolutely

00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,680
beautiful to see because you can tell

00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,260
that especially from someone as

00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,390
charismatic as Bernstein to just know

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,430
that okay this is actually the time for

00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,920
me to step back they know what they're

00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,320
doing in this particular moment they do

00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,420
not need me and you actually have that

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,210
many times in music because there are a

00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:32,520
lot of time in music where there are

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:34,890
solos and there is no need for the for

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,860
the conductor to conduct extremely

00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:40,290
clearly just let the solo player do his

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,480
thing and then make it up in the solo

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:46,590
sorry and then pick it up when the solo

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:51,420
is done so I think I'm getting close to

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:54,570
the end let's see yeah I'm almost done

00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,580
here so before I go on to the conclusion

00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:59,490
I just would like to mention the case of

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,110
the Berlin Philharmonic because the

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,030
Berlin Philharmonic is a very

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,980
interesting organization it's currently

00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:07,530
considered to be one of the best if not

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,600
the best orchestra in the world and they

00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:12,870
have a very specific way of recruiting

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,240
their conductor it's actually not a

00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,990
chairman or a board of directors that

00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,350
picks

00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,820
and hires a conductor it's the orchestra

00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:25,080
it's all the members of the orchestra

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:28,170
that vote for whoever they want that is

00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,270
an active conductor and you are in the

00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:33,480
world they vote for their favorite and

00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:35,760
whoever gets more votes is invited to

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,200
work with the Berlin Philharmonic and

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,780
usually of course they say yes because

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,860
it's it's amazing and it's quite a great

00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,990
it's probably like the peak of your

00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:47,280
career if you conduct for the Berlin

00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:49,020
Philharmonic so it's really the I love

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,620
this case because it really shows that

00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:54,030
it really shows who has the power and it

00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,330
is the people who actually make the

00:22:54,030 --> 00:23:00,030
music of course conductors are extremely

00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:01,590
talented people but in the end they know

00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:03,900
that they're not the ones making the

00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:06,780
music they're here to facilitate to

00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,610
enable the music to happen but they

00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,010
don't actually make it and the only way

00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:15,750
for them to make it is to have absolute

00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:19,860
respect and Trust in their musicians so

00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:21,240
as a conclusion I just wanted to tell a

00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,559
personal anecdote I'm not sure we're

00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,130
gonna have time for that so I can just

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:28,440
skip that but I would just like to for

00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:32,550
you to think about what it means to

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,800
actually reach harmony in a non musical

00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:36,450
context harmony and music is easy we can

00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,030
all hear when something sounds good

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:41,070
there's harmony and it's beautiful when

00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,830
we're not in a musical context what does

00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:48,210
it mean between the team and the leader

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:50,730
or the manager of the team so for all

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:54,390
members I think it means knowing your

00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:58,740
place and being happy at the place

00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:01,800
you're in and for the manager or the

00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,470
leader is to give a clear direction a

00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,470
clear goal and at the same time having

00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:12,030
confidence that the team is able to

00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:15,059
reach that goal so again it does require

00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:17,400
a lot of communication a lot of respect

00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:19,679
a lot of understanding and knowledge of

00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,540
all the different parts of the team and

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,870
I think what I really like about the

00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:29,490
orchestra is that it really shows that

00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:31,500
in a very clear way there again

00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:33,870
you cannot really pick your position

00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,090
your instrument picks your position for

00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:38,520
you in the orchestra but still you are

00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:41,429
making music yes you are not the solo

00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,559
player but you're actually making music

00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:45,330
that you would not be able to make as a

00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:48,330
solo player you're part of something

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:51,480
that it's way bigger than you and it's a

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:56,490
very beautiful and exhilarating

00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:58,980
experience so that's it for this talk on

00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,050
skill transfer I think there's a lot to

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,410
learn from other areas of life and we

00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:06,150
can always look at other areas of life

00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:08,850
that are not related to our work and

00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:11,460
think about how we can learn from these

00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:13,950
different areas I know personally making

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:17,540
music and practicing music has taught me

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:20,940
a lot in terms of discipline and

00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:24,030
practice and not giving up when things

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,950
are hard and the orchestra particularly

00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:27,960
helped me when it came to actually

00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:32,220
working in teams which was something I

00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,750
was not exactly gifted for and so I'm

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,840
sure that I would really like you

00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:39,990
actually to tell me in comments or later

00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,929
if you have other areas in life that

00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:45,179
inspired you and are a way for you to

00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:47,070
put your own work situation in

00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:56,970
perspective and help you get better in

00:25:47,070 --> 00:26:01,140
your work thank you thank you so now I

00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:02,970
see I have 48 questions I'm sorry I

00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,800
didn't see any of that I will add no

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:11,910
access to that so I'm gonna look at this

00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:13,679
right now let's see I don't think

00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,270
they're all questions it's like just a

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,200
lot of comments about how great you are

00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:20,790
and then if anybody does have a question

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,470
they can raise their hand or unmute we

00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:25,970
have about two more minutes you can give

00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,970
questions before lightning talks start

00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:38,080
so if nobody else is going to jump in

00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:40,540
one of the things that I was thinking

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,780
about with the comparison here is that

00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:46,060
is it even if a conductor isn't as

00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:48,040
skilled a musician as the people in the

00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,840
chairs obviously they can read music

00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,590
they could probably say something right

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,330
and and and I guess I I don't know if

00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,070
you have any specific thoughts on it but

00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,510
I think that I would hope that that

00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,790
would generally lead to a better

00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:02,530
experience than in in a lot of

00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:06,010
environments where the person managing a

00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:10,000
software project hasn't hasn't written

00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:12,910
any code of you know you've even used a

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,760
command line ever yes that's true now

00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:17,380
you can I don't think that when you want

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,080
to start learning to be a conductor

00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,550
there is any requirement of instruments

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,020
I don't think there is any specific

00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:25,600
instrument that you need to know how to

00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,940
play I know I had experiences with

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,970
conductors who were from all backgrounds

00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,680
some were violinists some were clarinet

00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:34,950
players there were very different some

00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,980
where pianists so not Orchestra players

00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:41,020
so you really have very different

00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:44,020
positions I think I see your point I

00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:45,970
think that more than the actual

00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:49,050
technical knowledge is really the

00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:51,730
willingness to understand what are the

00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:57,910
problems that a person is facing in

00:27:51,730 --> 00:28:00,160
their own specific situation okay I

00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:03,880
think and I think it's something that

00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:06,010
can be reached in any situation but of

00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,630
course the more technical the job the

00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,550
harder it's gonna be for the manager if

00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:13,540
the manager has no technical background

00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:15,730
either so but then the manager may have

00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:17,980
someone else as a an assistant manager

00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:20,740
that is a more technical person that can

00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,690
you know communicate better with some

00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:25,780
members of the team or something it

00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,970
really has to I mean again conductors

00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,940
also they have assistants they are not

00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:32,350
necessarily here for all rehearsals they

00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,660
there's a lot of delegation also that's

00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:36,460
involved in the day-to-day so that's

00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:41,550
something that's also very important to

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:41,550
keep in mind okay thank you

00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,860
I see someone saying the conductor

00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,600
probably has the best ear and will

00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,610
generally be excellent at one instrument

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,760
deaths that's true and again that's the

00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:01,580
kind of thing where if to go back to the

00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:04,010
technical aspect if the conductor is

00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,360
actually able to tell you careful your

00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:08,120
intonation is not great

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,130
then the musicians know okay he actually

00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,220
knows what he's talking about

00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:16,240
so it's it's true that the technical

00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:18,950
aspect is very important and being

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,920
having a good enough technical

00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:23,180
background is the first thing it's like

00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,010
yeah it's what I said it's really

00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,260
knowledge you have to know your

00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:29,180
instruments and you have to know what is

00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,760
going to be difficult what in a specific

00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:38,720
piece will cause a problem for your

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:41,360
musicians okay well I think that's it so

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,880
I'm just gonna say goodbye thank you for

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,880
