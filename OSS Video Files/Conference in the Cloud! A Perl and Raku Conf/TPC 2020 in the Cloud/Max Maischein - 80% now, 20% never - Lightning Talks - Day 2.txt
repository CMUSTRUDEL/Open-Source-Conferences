no but max is ready to go so you're up

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:11,150
do you see my slides yep

00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:15,379
great yeah hello everybody I'm

00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:20,699
presenting something not entirely Paul

00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:22,949
the tortoise named 80% now 20% never and

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,949
I want to tell you a bit about my

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:30,929
adventure adventures with JavaScript and

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:35,489
the HTML content editable tag well

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:39,149
recently I've discovered carnate nodes

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:42,120
it's an Android application available on

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:45,270
f-droid org and it basically is my

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,690
replacement for Google keep another good

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,809
not keeping app but Google keep is run

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:56,699
by Google and I want to do GLE myself as

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:59,640
far as possible and yeah it works quite

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,520
nice it can write to a web dev fair so

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,090
yeah synchronizing with my desktop is

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:10,500
good but I also want to edit those files

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:14,520
on the desktop those files are basically

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:19,530
zip archives and have a single file in

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:24,390
them mostly the index dot HTML which

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:28,200
contains the note more or less in HTML

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,299
but yeah editing those zip archives is a

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,590
pain because well you have to run an

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:37,560
unzip program to unpack them then edit

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,210
them then recreate the zip file again so

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,399
yeah I wrote a small power program that

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:47,070
unzips the fire opens it in the web

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,790
browser and there I can use the content

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:54,420
editable to edit the HTML and write it

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:58,740
back this is basically prepending body

00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:03,210
content editable true to the HTML file

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:07,049
and launches it in the browser and when

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:11,069
I press ctrl s to save it the web server

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:13,290
receives the content again trips the

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:17,099
outer HTML and right

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:21,870
sit back to the zip file and yeah that's

00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:27,239
basically it and I'm going to try to

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:31,859
even show it in action it looks like

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:37,109
this here I have a test note and here I

00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:40,260
even can edit add new items or stuff

00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:43,530
like that and if the content editor Pro

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:48,599
does not work I can also edit the raw

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:52,099
HTML here so yeah that's basically how

00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:57,030
it works and it works surprisingly well

00:02:52,099 --> 00:03:00,900
automatically adding new list items and

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:06,120
I could also paste images here and stuff

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:12,180
like that but yes not everything is that

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:14,569
great let me switch back because there

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,879
are a lot of problems with this approach

00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:21,180
this approach gives me 80% of the

00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:24,900
functionality I want but the remaining

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:28,290
20% eat up all the development time I'm

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,290
willing to spend on this for example I'd

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,799
like to have released rearranging by

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:37,229
drag and drop this is not provided by

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:42,979
the browser defaults and I would

00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:46,709
basically have to rewrite much of the

00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:51,079
editing code and also extracting the

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:54,780
data from the HTML is very nasty to do

00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:58,769
also I'm not sure if I want to paste or

00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,260
if I want to keep the images or display

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:04,919
the images in the size they were pasted

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:08,189
so I'd like to resize those these are

00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:11,069
all events that you do not get from the

00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:13,560
content editable code so you have to use

00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:18,680
hex or you just have to re-implement

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:23,219
your own HTML editor so yeah that's it

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:26,099
the code is online um if you have

00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:26,639
questions you can mail me at Korean at

00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:32,389
Korean

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,389
net yeah and that's it thank you

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,770
