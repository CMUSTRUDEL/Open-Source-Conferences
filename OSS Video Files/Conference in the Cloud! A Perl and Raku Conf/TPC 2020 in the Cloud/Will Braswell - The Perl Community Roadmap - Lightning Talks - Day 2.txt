Title: Will Braswell - The Perl Community Roadmap - Lightning Talks - Day 2
Publication date: 2020-06-25
Playlist: TPC 2020 in the Cloud
Description: 
	Finally, the Perl interpreter has a strong technical roadmap through v7.0 and beyond!  Now we can turn our attention to the larger questions of where our community is headed, and how can we become the masters of our own collective destiny?  Let's figure out how to "Put Perl Back On Top"!

and you see my camel yes okay greetings

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,460
everyone this is will the chill you may

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,830
know me by my legal name Wilbur as well

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,349
we're going to give a crash course

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,109
overview of the narrow the nupro

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:22,199
community road map this is on pro

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:23,670
community dot org and it's got a sort of

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,189
front page it gives you an overview of

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,710
what we're trying to do essentially our

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,890
goal is to put purl back on top if you

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:36,420
go to these links you can see that we

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,219
used to have very high ranks in fact we

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,680
were like close to number one we were

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,379
all the way up at the top back up a few

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,000
decades in the past but we want to reach

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,940
Eve that now and I think Perl seven is a

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,649
great step towards achieving that we we

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,930
have a whole bunch of ideas basically

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,079
we're taking all possible ideas and

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,230
trying to just see what works see what

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,480
sticks so if you if you go down in here

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,840
you can drill down into each one by

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,100
clicking on the learn more button and

00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,439
and there's always that you know we have

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,420
of course a little fortune up here from

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,850
from Larry that goes through a number of

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,439
his quotes but essentially we've come up

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,450
with several different ideas under each

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,600
heading so this is the education heading

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,640
we want to target you know young teens

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,290
that haven't chosen a line a language

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,119
yet they may be looking at Python they

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,189
may be looking at JavaScript we want

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,340
them to look at Perl as well we want to

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,869
set up social clubs for them to do that

00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,280
the ones that want rank advancement can

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,020
do it through the Boy Scouts and space

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,439
Scouts already we do have a merit badge

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:41,610
for programming and Perl is on the

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,829
official BSA website for that rank

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,500
advancement we want to make certified

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:50,009
youth programming sort of thing you can

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,700
actually look at the link here and it

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:57,899
does bring you to a Perl code example

00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:01,170
that that is on the BSA's whoops wrong

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,119
link that's on the BSA's website but you

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,899
can go into all that stuff here a lot of

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,520
these links ask for people to sign up

00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:10,830
because we need help to implement all

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,900
these things under industry I'm going as

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,680
quick as I can by the way we do have

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,090
some

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,799
highlights on things you want to do with

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,200
machine learning which is a big deal in

00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:21,870
industry of course science is a big deal

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,969
giving live demos to managers so that

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,340
they see that Perl seven is a new shiny

00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:28,109
thing putting on job fairs in your local

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,420
community partnered probably with your

00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:32,730
pro mongers groups by the way if you

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,980
haven't seen the video the pro paradox

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,170
from the 2016 Perl conference by dr.

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,780
Radcliffe you need to watch that because

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:44,730
it will explain why it's okay for Perl

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:47,069
to be both legacy and new with Perl 7 if

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,439
you look under apps we've got a whole

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,419
slew of stuff it's not just mobile but

00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,549
we want to have Perl and video games

00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,409
you're probably gonna need the are Perl

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:58,349
optimizing compiler to achieve that we

00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:00,959
want to have pearl in the office space

00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,489
we want to have of course Perl on mobile

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,439
I'm working on a new pro phone thing

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:07,230
there was a Perl phone presentation

00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,260
yesterday as well obviously server side

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,549
is where Perl excels we've got a ton of

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,950
awesome server stuff for Perl we just

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,959
need to keep doing better as always and

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,819
then you have the Grand Challenges I

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,709
believe that Perl can help solve a

00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,150
number of the grand challenges and I

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,150
think that's one of the ways that girls

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,109
can really show how awesome we are on a

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,120
global scale

00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:29,699
of course doing events like hackathons

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,199
also helps people build apps I'm not

00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:32,340
even going to try and go too deep into

00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,959
the remaining ones but we have a whole

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,329
bunch of stuff about accessibility how

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,030
you can get for all how curl can help

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:41,220
people that need help and how you can

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,659
put together activities for that under

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,919
performance of course you're gonna hear

00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,979
about the compiler you're gonna hear

00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,620
about Rainey's see Perl version all of

00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:52,199
this buzzwords like multi-core big data

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,720
and so forth marketing there's a whole

00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,489
slew of stuff under here that I wish I

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,799
could go into more but it's everything

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,870
from podcasts to making your own

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,879
brochures to putting out merchandise

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,030
which Wendy and Liz really mentored me

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,889
on and and so on and then we have of

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,540
course a page for our dear sister

00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,669
language rock ooh and just kind of an

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,769
explanation of how rock you came to be

00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:15,479
and and what it's all about now we have

00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,759
not updated with Pro seven yet but we'll

00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:19,919
have all that on here soon and with that

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,019
I thank you please contribute to the

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,830
Perl community roadmap on pro community

00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,830
org
