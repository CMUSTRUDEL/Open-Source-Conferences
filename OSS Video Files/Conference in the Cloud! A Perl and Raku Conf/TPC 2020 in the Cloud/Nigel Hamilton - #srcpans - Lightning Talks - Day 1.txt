Title: Nigel Hamilton - #srcpans - Lightning Talks - Day 1
Publication date: 2020-06-24
Playlist: TPC 2020 in the Cloud
Description: 
	Google associates search problems with solutions - it's an association engine. Search on Google for 'parse a CSV file'. Where is Perl? Where is Raku? CPAN and modules.raku.org are full of solutions! When programmers have a problem we want them to find Perl and Raku solutions.

SCRPans is a proposal for a new TPF sponsored code sharing site for Perl and Raku, powered by our community and backed by CPAN and modules.raku.org. Think ....  Stackoverflow meets RosettaCode.

This talk presents a mock user interface and proposes an MVP site and next steps. Give your feedback. Leave search trails to Perl and Raku. Support SRCPans.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
naj I'm just another Rock ooh and pearl

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,090
hacker faced in bath you could think of

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,910
me as a jar from bath in the UK and

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,219
tonight I want to talk about pearl and

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,029
rock ooh and ways of doing search engine

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:20,699
optimization so old Perl programmers and

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:25,529
you use alike can discover pearl and

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:31,500
rocky like you have slides I do can you

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:34,469
not see them now we see you do you see

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:39,450
this that's better

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:44,300
you see slides yeah you see slides yep

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:46,950
yes great okay so he's the problem and

00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,280
two days ago I went searching on Google

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,940
for pausing in CSV file and this is what

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,520
I found lots of - lots of Java going

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,359
down the page more paths and more Java a

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,989
little bit of JavaScript and no Perl

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,060
what page do you think Perl appears on

00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:09,869
well it's not two not three not four not

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,390
five page six so this is the first

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:15,990
vaguely Perl related module I could find

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,479
in the Google results so unfortunately

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,400
this means that Perl is basically being

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,659
sentenced to search engine Siberia

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,030
because no one's really going to page

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,400
six and certainly no new Perl

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,790
programmers going to going to page six

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,220
of Google to discover well but what

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,850
about Rocky where's rocky lean Google's

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:42,329
results well I went through page 10 15

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:46,920
20 got to the end page 22 no sign of

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:49,820
Rocky so if Perl has been consigned to

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:55,640
Siberia then I'm afraid rocku is off

00:01:49,820 --> 00:02:00,469
freezing on Pluto so this is a problem

00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,850
what can we do about it why is Google

00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:05,189
forgetting about the 30 years of history

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,429
I mean pearls been parsing CSV files for

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,500
years why is it being consigned to page

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,349
six

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,950
well what's Google's game well it's just

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,890
trying

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,459
to associate search problems user search

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:23,190
problems with good solutions and in a

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,530
way Google is a kind of an association

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,019
engine it's not really a search engine

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,220
it's just looking to associate problems

00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:35,519
and their solutions a bit like an ant

00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:37,500
might associate with a food source it's

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,920
trying to find the optimal solution for

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,330
a given search problem so that

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,940
association between problems solution is

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,250
something I think pearl and rocky may be

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,160
missing so I think there's something we

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,709
can do about it I'd like to suggest that

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,090
we should create a new website which

00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,519
I've given the working title of

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,489
saucepans which is a kind of a mash-up

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,519
of Stack Overflow rosetta code and Sipan

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:05,280
and it's a place where coding problems

00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,640
and coding solutions will sit side by

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,519
side it'll be community driven 100%

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,069
owned by the TPF ad revenue would go to

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,150
the TPF and it would promote pearl and

00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,250
rocky together

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,430
other languages could also feature on

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:23,430
the site well how would it look well

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:27,660
here's a mock-up some wireframes of an

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:30,209
MVP and here we see clearly stated the

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,160
problem and the problems stated from the

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,810
perspective of the user and I think

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,000
that's really important because it's the

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,450
users perspective that Google is

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,340
capturing next to the problem is the

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,620
solution and so there's a clear

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,480
association between problem and solution

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,819
something that Google is going to be

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,540
able to ingest and something that humans

00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:54,209
will be able to easily work out and then

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,310
finally there's a call to action the

00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,560
user will then move forward they won't

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,230
get back to Google and that's important

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,620
because we need to signal to Google that

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:08,400
this site is a good solution for the

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,970
search problem so I think it's doable

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,069
and the site would in many respects be a

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:18,180
quite similar to Stack Overflow you'd be

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:20,760
able to enter new problems searching for

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,620
solutions you then be able to see the

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,699
most recent problems that people have

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,580
asked for

00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:31,509
these could then be you can then submit

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:33,550
a solution and then users can build a

00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:35,800
profile over time of solutions that

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,840
they've submitted including links back

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,169
to you for example their Sipan modules

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,930
twitter get up etc and so we would have

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:46,689
an exchange of authority going to this

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,909
profile and then from this profile to

00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:52,990
the results and the solutions that this

00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:55,419
user has provided so I think we can do

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,620
it I think we can play Google's

00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:59,729
Association game

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,379
we just need to expose the problems that

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:06,400
associate with Perl and ruku solutions

00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:08,680
and by using other languages as well we

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,669
get to benefit from the search engine

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,740
optimization of that but also as a

00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:16,569
community we will be open to programmers

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,289
from other languages we won't be

00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:21,520
isolated and out in the cold so if

00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:23,979
you're interested in helping me with

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,669
this then please join me in hashtag

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:30,279
saucepans in the slack channel and we

00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:32,729
can discuss an MVP and what the next

00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,729
