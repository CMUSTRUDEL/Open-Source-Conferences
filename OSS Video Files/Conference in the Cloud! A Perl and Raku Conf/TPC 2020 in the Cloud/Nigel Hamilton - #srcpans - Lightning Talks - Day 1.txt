Title: Nigel Hamilton - #srcpans - Lightning Talks - Day 1
Publication date: 2020-06-24
Playlist: TPC 2020 in the Cloud
Description: 
	Google associates search problems with solutions - it's an association engine. Search on Google for 'parse a CSV file'. Where is Perl? Where is Raku? CPAN and modules.raku.org are full of solutions! When programmers have a problem we want them to find Perl and Raku solutions.

SCRPans is a proposal for a new TPF sponsored code sharing site for Perl and Raku, powered by our community and backed by CPAN and modules.raku.org. Think ....  Stackoverflow meets RosettaCode.

This talk presents a mock user interface and proposes an MVP site and next steps. Give your feedback. Leave search trails to Perl and Raku. Support SRCPans.
