putting people's videos on YouTube all

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,259
day so I haven't really had a chance to

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,820
practice this in fact there's one person

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,889
who's waiting for their video to be

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,320
edited because of this but you just have

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:16,170
to wait so I'm here quickly to talk

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,500
about a project that I have going with

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:23,070
some students here in Arlington Virginia

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,580
so title 2 min max in your diet with

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:31,500
rock ooh these are mostly for my benefit

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,059
because whatever so min maxing is a at

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,040
the very least I am familiar with it as

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:41,160
a online game playing thing where people

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,739
will choose armor and equipment and

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,260
weapons that maximize the statistics

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,360
they can possibly get out of their

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,649
character and this becomes competitive

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,230
everybody's trying to figure out this

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:56,059
new combination of stuff that they can

00:00:52,230 --> 00:01:01,739
get it will make them top of the chart

00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:05,280
and it occurred to me that in a country

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:08,310
where our diets and our health are quite

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,560
terrible we're spending roughly what the

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,390
AMA considers me quadruple the amount of

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:19,549
money on medical costs than is normal

00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:21,840
and my having personally been through

00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:23,659
losing and gaining weight a couple of

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,119
times

00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:32,100
nutrition is statistics it's its

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,420
parameters its its stats I guess it was

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,520
what you they are usually called against

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,880
they apply to the things that you put in

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,130
your mouth so and the right ones you put

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,909
in actually have a great to do a great

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,649
deal to do with your health so why not

00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:48,329
apply this concept to something that my

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,259
ex shouldn't accidentally make people

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:56,939
healthier in the process so this was the

00:01:52,259 --> 00:02:00,479
basis for the idea the project is

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:03,479
something I brought to code for Nova

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,250
which is a extension of Code for America

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,060
which is a civic hacking sort of

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,770
organization and I hesitated to do so

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,480
for years because it was a huge project

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,650
and I was like who am I to suggest this

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,939
but as soon as I did

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,909
because they were running low on stuff

00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:20,129
to do the one of the brigade captains

00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:21,930
who happens to be a teacher locally

00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:26,340
slashed right onto and said yeah we're

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,930
doing that and he got a bunch of

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,799
students involved as well these are high

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,629
school students who are learning

00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:37,370
programming in high school and this is

00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:39,599
going for a grade for them so yeah and

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,859
they come and go the students come and

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,129
go they're only going to be there for so

00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:45,420
long

00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:47,340
and it's a big project for a small

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,900
handful of people especially when we're

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,909
doing in raku which is more mature than

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,829
it was but I mean we're all learning it

00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:57,180
and that was one of the reasons that

00:02:55,829 --> 00:03:00,900
we're doing in raku is because this

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,159
teacher who himself had been on the

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,319
ground floor in the early days with

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,030
Python and appreciated this sort of new

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,159
community of people who are energetic

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,989
about this brand of thing it's like I

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,909
want that again for these students and

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,709
so I was like we're using that I

00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:17,790
personally would probably have used mojo

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:21,120
or something but we're doing in Araku so

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,829
code for Nova and Code for America is

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,810
sort of a non-profit interested in

00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,209
collaborating with government usually

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,819
local government to solve problems that

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,769
they may not be equipped to handle on

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:33,690
their own especially in this era of

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:36,359
everybody slashing budgets for

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:40,169
everything and civic hacking is the

00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:42,569
concept of doing good with collaborative

00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:43,979
projects there there's usually a

00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:45,959
programming element there's often an

00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:49,459
artistic element sometimes it's just a

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,690
bunch of people sitting in a room just

00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,010
collectively answering questions and

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,629
putting them online and it's not really

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,129
technical at all but it's just this mass

00:03:54,629 --> 00:04:00,030
project that people get together to do

00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:04,560
get together to do to solve a local

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:06,510
problem and this project that's one of

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,799
the reasons why I wasn't sure if it

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,120
should be applied here is because it's

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,349
something that could be spread

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,449
everywhere it could be designed to have

00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:16,919
local nodes that's open free and open

00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:18,720
source you just downloaded off github

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,310
and you install it on a docker container

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,289
somewhere and get it running for your

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,610
town and the people you know the people

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:26,340
the time will sort of compete with each

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,380
other to make the best recipes that cost

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,580
the least taste

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,590
most have the best nutrition but not and

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:38,510
they're always the idea is basically to

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:41,420
get them to jovially I suppose compete

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,160
to make these potentially emergent

00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:47,630
recipes that will be good for people

00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,760
cost little and whatnot so if anybody's

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,140
interested in this at all we're not that

00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,470
far into the project

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:56,300
it's the code that exists we'll be quite

00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,220
obviously the code written by people who

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,680
are learning to program much less

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,210
learning raku at the same time it's tons

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,500
of room for refactoring on what's

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,740
already been done in there's way more

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,800
stuff that we haven't even got to yet

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,660
the plan is rocku easily running dark

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,020
containers the front the UI is going to

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,490
be well was was going to be angular I've

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,640
heard something in a previous talk that

00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,650
suggested there alternatives and if

00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,690
you're curious about the science behind

00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,910
why I thought this was good idea dr.

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,870
Lustig has videos on YouTube talking

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,840
about something called metabolic

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,320
syndrome which is the basis for the

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,070
whole thing so that's pretty much it I'm

00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,440
Josh

00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,870
that's my email id where I've attended

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:44,450
Dees p.m. up until pretty much nobody

00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:46,490
did i co-organized DC bbw with coaching

00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,330
over and I work for now at numbers USA

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,330
thank you very much
