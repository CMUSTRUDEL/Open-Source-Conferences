Title: Olaf Alders and Mark Fowler - Getting Started with GitHub Actions
Publication date: 2020-06-25
Playlist: TPC 2020 in the Cloud
Description: 
	Continuous Integration systems such as GitHub Actions and CircleCI allow you to automate tasks such as building, testing and linting your code. After this talk youâ€™ll be equipped to use these tools to:

Build and test your code on Linux, macOS and Windows using GitHub Actions and CircleCI
Speed up your build time
Set up code coverage
Use build artifacts

I will be using some Perl-specific examples, but much of the content will be useful across different languages.  This talk will get you up and running quickly and will provide you with sample configurations you can use right now. In particular, we will talk about lightning fast testing for Dist::Zilla modules, installing your Perl prerequisites faster and a strategy to build once and then test many times.
