this is Kiev and I'm going to talk about

00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:11,120
the pull request Club today booty quest

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:15,120
club is an application that is live at

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,330
request dot Club it's an app where you

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:23,100
sign up to get monthly assignments

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,949
assignments that consist of an open

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,920
source library and your goal if you get

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:35,219
an assignment is to submit a pre quest

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:38,010
to your assignment library 2018 was the

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,860
last year of Sipan request challenge I

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:43,920
presented in Salt Lake City and I put a

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,780
slide up announcing that I just started

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,110
building for a quest club now two years

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:53,010
have passed and the site now looks like

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:56,190
this you could sign up with your github

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,370
account only with a few clicks once you

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,440
sign up you get a you get your first

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,850
assignment this is a special assignment

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:09,840
that walks you through your very first

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:12,840
pull request you can also sync your

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,100
github repositories to pull requests

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,619
I'll Club and check the ones you want to

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,110
be added to the assignment pool so if

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,689
you for example sync your projects here

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,330
and check a few of them it can be

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:31,049
assigned to other participants let's

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:34,549
look at a few shiny charts number of

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:40,909
users are growing it's almost up to 125

00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:43,700
number of assignments is almost 240 250

00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:46,380
unfortunately assignments done meaning

00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:50,130
assignments that are resulted in at

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,530
least one poor request is about 1/3 of

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:56,700
that number and I'm looking for ways to

00:01:52,530 --> 00:02:00,840
improve that ratio number of

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,759
repositories in the assignment pool it

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,979
has its jumps but it's been mostly flat

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,530
so if you have projects libraries on

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,890
github that each chain can use some help

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:14,040
feel free to sign up and add them to the

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:17,310
pool another thing with the pool is

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:21,180
that it's mostly pearl it's almost all

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:25,489
pearl and honestly I was hoping to get a

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:29,609
more diverse set of repositories by now

00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:31,909
so I built a feature asking users what

00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:34,409
the appropriate preferred languages are

00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:37,079
asking to see which languages they would

00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:38,970
like to work on and the resulting pie

00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:42,720
chart as you can see is a little more

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:45,620
colorful than the previous one another

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,840
update was you could previously only

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,599
sync your personal a studies now you can

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,659
sync your organizational apostolis on

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,620
github as well so those can get requests

00:02:54,659 --> 00:03:02,129
ooh previously I was emailing

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,389
participants from my personal email

00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:06,629
saying hey I just sent you a new

00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:08,700
assignment but by next month this is

00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:10,950
going to change it's all going to be

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,549
automated and you will even have a shiny

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:17,250
unsubscribe link so to go over quickly

00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:19,680
that special first assignment is a new

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:23,159
thing to put west Club emails every can

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,650
progress internationalization is always

00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:30,120
in my mind to increase to reach more

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:33,449
people assignments are still hand-picked

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:38,129
and I'm hoping to get that automated at

00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:40,049
some point and one thing I'm missing one

00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:41,849
thing that was in Sipan pull request

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,069
challenge but not input request Club is

00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,440
team assignments where you sign up to

00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:49,229
get an assignment as a team not as a

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,780
person and meet with your team and maybe

00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:54,060
like order pizza and spend the night

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,669
hacking in module and I'm hoping to

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,470
bring that back at some point that's all

00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:00,859
it's full requested Club thanks for
