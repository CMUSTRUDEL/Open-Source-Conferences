all right good now am i muted so last

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:06,930
but not least I wanted to give a talk

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,340
and Jeff we were talking this morning

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,110
about his wonderful background which he

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,660
doesn't have on and I told him he had to

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,400
have it on for this lightning talk but

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,859
we were talking about his wonderful duck

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,380
collection that he had there thank you

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,300
Jeff's wonderful duck collection so I

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,430
commented on it talking about how I just

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,199
gave a talk about talk to your duck and

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,750
he asked me if I would reprise it so

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,449
this is my lightning talk I talk about

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:34,770
talking to your duck duck excuse me

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:37,770
gotta watch the language here slides all

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,480
right so what the duck so for those who

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,059
don't know what talk to your duck is

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,739
basically the key point around it is

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,989
that if you have a mental block if you

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,340
have an architectural design issue if

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,710
you have a bug that you haven't fixed

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,230
what you do is you get a rubber ducky

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,420
and you basically talk to the duck and

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,760
you walk it through the problem of what

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,160
you're having and basically by doing

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,660
this the the concept is that by

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,699
organizing your thoughts getting a

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,229
different point of view around it you

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,900
will have an aha moment when you're

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,580
talking to your duck and basically I

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,790
will tell you this really works it's a

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,040
it's a well known technique it came from

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,840
the pragmatic programmers where I heard

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,450
about it I'm pretty sure that is the

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,090
source of certainly talking to the duck

00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,409
and it works you know amazingly well so

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,150
if you're having a problem with a duck

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,369
that's what can do it but I also wanted

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,740
to kind of give you guys a little bit

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,790
more information in depth about what not

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,710
to do with your dock so 6 do not do's

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,880
with your dogs so first of all no

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,799
singing do your duck

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,939
so no rubber ducky songs nothing not

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,680
allowed to do that number 2 is no

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,500
shunning your duck you have to put it in

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,000
a prominent place as Jeff is done has to

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,470
be on a shelf right there you know

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,070
people have to see your duck collection

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,630
this is this is very very important the

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,450
third thing is you are not allowed to

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,009
use other animals there are heathens out

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,770
there who will tell you that you can do

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,960
cats or dogs or rubber plants that is

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,170
all it doesn't work it's

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,179
scientifically proven not to work

00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:11,580
additionally what makes it very bad is I

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,470
have cats that's one of my older cats

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,660
there is named spooky here

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,270
since the corona pandemic hit and I'm

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,380
quarantine he has been given the title

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:24,870
of VP of but he's the VP of kibble

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:27,540
depletion my other younger cat is the VP

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,280
of inappropriate vomiting and I find

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,200
that if I try and talk to them they come

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,790
and rub their head on my keyboard and I

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,530
end up with more bugs because I end up

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,600
with pluses and zeros throughout my code

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,950
so you cannot use live animals either ah

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,330
very important thing and Jeff has broken

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,730
this rule you're not allowed to have

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,770
more than 12 ducks if you get more than

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,720
12 ducks you're officially a hoarder and

00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,880
you have to give your ducks away to new

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,810
programmers that they learn how to talk

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:57,420
to ducks next rule is you're not allowed

00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,180
to feed them after midnight and the

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,300
final rule is if your ducks talk back

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:07,320
you need to really lower your alcohol

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,840
consumption and seek help so after you

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,730
get done talking to your ducks the next

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,350
step that you want to do is something

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,680
that comes from extreme programming or

00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,500
XP XP kind of predated agile it's now

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,570
considered a subset of agile but the

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,090
main things that I want to point out

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,350
with it is pair programming we use this

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,769
a lot at our company where people

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,989
program with hangouts meet one or more

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,870
people looking at the person typing it

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,880
really fixes bugs it gives that kind of

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,130
like super duck kind of quality to the

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,140
codes and the people can go oh maybe you

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,950
want to do this instead really great

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:46,410
technique kind of the super duck type of

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,330
technology and especially another thing

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:52,410
with XP that most people know nowadays

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,360
is MVP or minimal Viable Product XP kind

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,910
of really pushed that on years ago

00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,799
saying that about the anecdotally they

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,590
would say like 95% of the code that you

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,120
wrote was wasted so try and focus on

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,120
what's the important code that you need

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,920
and only program that so two things to

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,140
take away from XP programming as well

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,700
other than that that's the end if

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,290
anybody really wants these slides I'll

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,019
put them up there but other than that

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,870
enjoy talking to your water fowl so

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,199
thank you

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,199
