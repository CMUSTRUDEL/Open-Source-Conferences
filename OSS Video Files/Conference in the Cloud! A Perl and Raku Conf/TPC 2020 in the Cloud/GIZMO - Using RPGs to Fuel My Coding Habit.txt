Title: GIZMO - Using RPGs to Fuel My Coding Habit
Publication date: 2020-06-25
Playlist: TPC 2020 in the Cloud
Description: 
	I wanted a quicker way to figure out the loot that monsters had. That also turned out to be a good reason to learn how to use a module and understand YAML a bit more.
Once I was able to quickly get loot, what about determining what the kinds of things the players met? It was an ideal excuse to write a dispatch table. Once I had that written I wanted to share it. Instead of trying to figure out how to package it up, I learned how to use the Mojolicious web framework to make it a web app.
Form fillable PDFs make it easy to provide pre-generated characters for players at a gaming convention. What if I could start with a simple YAML file and have a program fill out the PDF for me?
Much of my hobby code Iâ€™ve written is to support one of my favorite hobbies, RPGs.
After attending this talk I hope that you will better understand how to:
use a module to randomly generate events
use a dispatch table instead of nested if structures
share a program you wrote that goes from the command line to the web.
use your hobbies to improve your skills in other areas of your life
sharing your work with a community makes you aware of how you code
