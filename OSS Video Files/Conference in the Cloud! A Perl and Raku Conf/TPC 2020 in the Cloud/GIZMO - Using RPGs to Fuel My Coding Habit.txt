Title: GIZMO - Using RPGs to Fuel My Coding Habit
Publication date: 2020-06-25
Playlist: TPC 2020 in the Cloud
Description: 
	I wanted a quicker way to figure out the loot that monsters had. That also turned out to be a good reason to learn how to use a module and understand YAML a bit more.
Once I was able to quickly get loot, what about determining what the kinds of things the players met? It was an ideal excuse to write a dispatch table. Once I had that written I wanted to share it. Instead of trying to figure out how to package it up, I learned how to use the Mojolicious web framework to make it a web app.
Form fillable PDFs make it easy to provide pre-generated characters for players at a gaming convention. What if I could start with a simple YAML file and have a program fill out the PDF for me?
Much of my hobby code Iâ€™ve written is to support one of my favorite hobbies, RPGs.
After attending this talk I hope that you will better understand how to:
use a module to randomly generate events
use a dispatch table instead of nested if structures
share a program you wrote that goes from the command line to the web.
use your hobbies to improve your skills in other areas of your life
sharing your work with a community makes you aware of how you code

so whenever you are ready I think we can

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:10,980
go and start okay thank you

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,179
hi my name is gizmo math boy and this is

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,740
using RPGs to fuel my coding habit thank

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,750
you Gary for Karina game many of us

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,050
still like to play today and here's to

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,250
celebrating a life well played

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,310
role playing games consists of players

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,599
playing some role in a fictional setting

00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,820
these players interact in the setting

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,030
their choices change and affect that

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,730
setting there's one person that creates

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,309
or manages the setting for players the

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:42,239
dungeon master or DM sometimes referred

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,500
to generically as game master or GM this

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,570
talk is focusing on tabletop

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,300
role-playing games these are primarily

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,750
played with pencil and paper and a

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,219
variety of polyhedral dice there are

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,680
different genres of role-playing games

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,010
mostly having to do with setting which

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,739
influences the roles the players play

00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:03,120
there cyberpunk like shadow run far

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,240
future science fiction like Star

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,689
frontiers even post nucular war

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,010
post-apocalyptic games like Gamma world

00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:13,140
then there's the one foundational to

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,900
them all Dungeons & Dragons which is

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,909
swords and sorcery I mostly play

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,920
Hyperborea which is derived and related

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,220
to D&D and most of my programs are

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,200
written for it the players interact the

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,259
setting through encounters this can

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,610
involve combat sometimes it

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,710
solving a puzzle to get some treasure

00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,450
sorry to interrupt or are still viewing

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,579
your slide number one I don't know if

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:45,509
it's normal or not oh it's not shown

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:48,270
over there mmm this is my screen

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:52,380
maybe unshare on we share that's my dad

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,930
a resume sure how's that I still use

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,280
line number one okay slide number two

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,899
now yeah buddy

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,170
it's good we can see the movie nice

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,399
necklace that's right

00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,140
so start home from beginning so using

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,099
RPGs to feel my code habit

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,090
I'm gizmo bath boy and here we go again

00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,709
thank you Gary for creating the game

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,480
many of us still like to play today

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,370
here's the celebrating a life wall

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,810
played

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,909
role-playing games consist of players

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,010
playing some role in a fictional setting

00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:22,230
these players interact in the setting

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,209
there are choices change and affect the

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,409
setting there's one person that creates

00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,870
or manages the setting for the players

00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:29,670
the dungeon master or DM sometimes

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,099
referred to generically as game master

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,810
or GM this talk is focusing on a

00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,159
tabletop role-playing games these are

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,609
primarily played with pencil and paper

00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:40,290
and a variety of polyhedral dice there

00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:42,090
are different genres of role-playing

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,340
games whilst having to do a setting

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,989
which influences the roles the players

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,340
play there is cyberpunk like shadow run

00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:53,219
far future science fiction like Star

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,669
frontiers even post nuclear war

00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:58,739
post-apocalyptic games like mo world

00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:01,199
then there is the foundational one to

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,659
them all Dungeons and Dragons swords and

00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,400
sorcery I'm also quite high play

00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,560
Hyperborean which is derived and related

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,109
to D&D and most of my programs are

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,120
written for it the players interact with

00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:15,090
the setting through encounters this can

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,669
involve combat sometimes it's solving a

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,290
puzzle to get some treasure these

00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:22,169
encounters can take place in dungeon

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,729
under a haunted keep or in old and

00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,250
despotic city ruled by a cabal of

00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:30,030
wizards so that's a very quick intro

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,889
into the world of RPGs so let's dive

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,639
into this hobby that fuels my coding

00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:38,099
habit as a DM there are many tables to

00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,669
use one such tables for Treasury monster

00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:43,650
might have let's look at the a class of

00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,319
treasure it hits all the kinds of

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,019
treasure possible the coins are readily

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,819
handled and understood gems truly and

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,519
magic have their own sets of tables

00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:57,449
beyond this one here's a snippet of the

00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:01,530
gems table even on that table there's

00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:03,659
more rollin that could be required julie

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,629
has a couple subsets of tables there's

00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:09,599
the types of jewelry and then there's

00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:13,409
the valiant composition jewelry which

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,250
has even more rollin on it magic also

00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:18,209
has a few sub tables as mentioned before

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,009
eventually you get to the far end of

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,560
this tree of tables then you start back

00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:25,349
at the beginning of this table that you

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,030
started things on and enroll more so

00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:29,730
it's looking for a way to automate

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,680
all of this rick cygnus created a

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,300
created role in tata meat things for him

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,960
it also helps a bit with the

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:40,440
organization and creation of tables so

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,639
far it's only on github so some tables

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,320
and a little bit of code you can

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,430
determine what loot that group of

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,470
bandits has this pro this is the program

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,110
- the usual boilerplate associated pro

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,410
programs it it has a naive assumption of

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,840
the input then you parse the input do

00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:00,360
some roll on tables based on that and

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,230
then you get your final result so let's

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:08,880
look at the tables roland uses it's

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:11,130
basically mo files in this distance in a

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,930
file like this it's just a list and it

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,600
performs an action on each item on this

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:18,030
list in this case the action is to load

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,940
another file and act on what is inside

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,400
that new file this is the copper piece

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,169
table you can define that you define the

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,620
dice to use in this case it's a

00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:30,330
percentile Rd 100 it reflects the 25

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,090
percent chance of getting some kind of

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,669
loot that's copper if the result is 1

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,100
through 25 then you roll again as the

00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:40,680
result and that helps determine the

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,020
amount of loot you have otherwise

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,370
there's nothing to do then roll and

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,440
finish this file then it goes to the

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,740
next file or action in the stack of

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,990
actions it has to do here's a snippet of

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,390
the gems table it shows some

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,130
modifications I made to the rolling code

00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,440
so we can have these embedded rules in

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,479
the results the double score back that

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,479
square brackets are used to delimit that

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,130
action it creates a it's a quick hack

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,570
which I haven't had much polish on or

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,900
you know put a pull request in the Rik

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:12,300
for it but it works for me we do

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,440
something similarly for jewelry to files

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:19,710
to work on one type of the types to get

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,830
your results and another to get its

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,180
value in composition the nice thing

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,800
about rolling is that you can also

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,780
directly roll on any tables that you

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,400
have created in this case I can roll

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,979
directly against the gems or jewelry

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:36,030
table if an encounter happens then you

00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:37,409
decide you want some gems or jewels so

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,140
once I got all this bit of drugs are

00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:40,980
taken care of I need to work on the

00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,600
encounters that

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,900
generate the need to determine the

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,550
treasure found specifically I odd made

00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,560
the encounter tables another player of

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,710
hyperborea created and offered to the

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,450
community it's just a PDF file but lots

00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,220
of tables and it has a little bit more

00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:01,440
watch logic required to work to automate

00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:03,690
the process to generate encounter is to

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,600
first know the location then an

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,930
encounter type is rolled against that

00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,360
location in this case like it's an alien

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:16,890
encounter tie animal or natural even

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:19,980
some specific like geyser or a bunch of

00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:24,390
berserkers the encounter types are

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:26,910
associated with terrain type so let's

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:30,510
determine encounter type for the Alice

00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,430
mercury location we could look at the

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,770
map of high priority to kind of see what

00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:38,070
possible terrain types there are there's

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:40,680
Hills ocean coastal and that's a

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,510
mountain or something we can then

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,360
consult the Gaza tier for the game to

00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,860
get more details in this case we found

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,800
out it's not just a mountain it's an

00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,950
extinct volcano so we have a volcanic

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,070
terrain in there as well so each terrain

00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:58,890
type has sub tables for the encounter

00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:02,280
type given here 3d encounter types for

00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:04,200
the volcanic terrain type let's say

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:09,300
we're all in the natural table and uh

00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:11,640
get a fever here is the table entry for

00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,680
fever that gives some us details what

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,270
happens if it affects a character how

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,820
long might affect the character and any

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:21,560
other notes do it may be any of any

00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:26,340
other rolling to do here's how the

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:29,840
location table looks like as rollin next

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:34,530
is an example of the volcanic terrain

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,270
for a natural encounter type so let's

00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,370
say this is just converting tables in

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:42,930
PDF files into gamal for rollin to

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:44,550
consume and for the fever result the

00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:50,730
actions it does it just returns the

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:52,740
texts in the file so how to make this

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,050
all automated

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,030
my first sketches I'm trying to solve

00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:00,060
this problem or basically lots of nested

00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,890
ifs and to me and from you know my

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,730
limited developer and program experience

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,810
that kind of indicates one form of

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,120
programming needs something I've been

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,730
meaning to figure out dispatch table

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,040
this was finally enough attentive for me

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,890
to understand how to code them and use

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,990
them and now a dispatch dispatch tables

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,610
are fun to me and probably the limit of

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,000
my clever list that I can still do but

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:27,260
so and here's a the dispatch table I

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,420
created to handle a random encounters

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,490
most of the entries here are stubs for

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,730
ideas I haven't fully fleshed out yet

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:39,360
but the playing role and sub table

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:45,990
entries do most of the work of for what

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:47,580
I need so elsewhere on the program I get

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,680
results for the location and train type

00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:53,520
and pass it to this process results are

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,010
routine it then iterates the results

00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,930
given to it with some regular

00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,490
expressions and those regular

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:03,240
expressions are associated with some

00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:05,550
tokens that are basically entries in the

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,740
dispatch table so I get a rigged exit

00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,870
and then process according to the

00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,530
dispatch table and gives the final

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:15,750
processed result here's a snippet of the

00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:18,690
ammo file that holds the rexes and their

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,480
associated tokens so now I have a

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:24,360
program to automate the encounters I

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,640
roll and since Ben gave that PDF to the

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,950
committee I was wondering how I could

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,750
best share my program with them - I was

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,240
thinking I didn't want to require them

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:37,470
to know how to install load Perl or

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:40,200
program girl and I decide to make web

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,930
app and I chose mojo because I hadn't

00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,450
really written anything for a modern web

00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:49,380
framework and you know I'm a kid excuse

00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:51,510
to learn how to code mojo here's a small

00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,510
portion of the starting page of that

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,400
Mojo Lite app the hardest part for me is

00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,410
a you know system in was you know trying

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,470
to figure out a decent layout in this

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,500
case I suddenly CSS grid for each letter

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,330
grouping of locations getting a panel in

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,740
it so you select a look

00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:12,960
and that presents a choices of look of

00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,320
terrain at that location and then you

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,090
select the terrain and then you get a

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,910
randomly generated result based on those

00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:24,720
choices

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:26,970
so here the routes I use in mojo you

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,740
know you got your basic route the next

00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,140
one you know matches a location in the

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,570
URL and then adds the terrain and then

00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,450
the final result that hands it off to

00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,690
the subroutine that processes things and

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:43,890
gets the actual work done and this is

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:45,840
the guts of that so he kind of rollin

00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:49,200
hub which is lets you do the automated

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:52,200
rolling and then it you know loads the

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,030
location file of the result that was

00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,370
given to it then you give it the terrain

00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:59,640
and stuff like that and then fortunately

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:01,290
for my web app I haven't implemented the

00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:06,120
dispatch table I created for my command

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:10,800
line app so I got you know more - it's -

00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:13,290
to work on there so northland vendors

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,390
publishes a character sheet for

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:21,810
hyperborea and it's a forum fillable PDF

00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:24,630
it has many many many pages form filters

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,430
on that form fillable PDFs are nice

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,380
which means you can type in the

00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,630
information you need instead of writing

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,570
with a pen or pencil which makes it less

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:36,030
legible to the players you give them -

00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,010
but it's also time consuming either way

00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:42,810
and I was wondering if I could somehow

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:46,250
automate this process I learned about

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:49,620
form data formats which is a way to

00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:52,560
automate the filling of form fillable

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:57,900
PDF assume when you have a program that

00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:01,740
understands FDS as part of that I needed

00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:04,440
to figure out the names of the fields in

00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:08,040
the PDF and here I use a program called

00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,740
master PDF Editor that shows the

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,660
properties of each field in this case

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:17,970
it's highlighting the strength attribute

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:20,160
and the actual FDF name for that for

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:23,310
this particular PDF there of

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,459
over 500 form fields that you could

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:28,589
potentially fill out and so I needed a

00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:31,019
more automated way to even get that the

00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:33,089
name fields and in this case there are a

00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:38,670
couple of tools I looked at PDF tool kit

00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:40,649
and can PDF I used both to figure out

00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,259
which one I like better and then they do

00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:46,500
things slightly differently and quit

00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:49,380
suddenly I use PDF TK as the program to

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:52,500
automatically feed an FDF file at PDF to

00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:55,319
create filled out PDF and here's an

00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:59,339
example of some of the 500 field names

00:13:55,319 --> 00:14:01,380
from that file so once I had my fdf

00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:04,649
I need to figure out what's the minimum

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:07,350
data set I thought I could use to create

00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:11,430
a useable character sheet in this case

00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:14,519
it was just 8 lines a llamo but many

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:17,040
many hours of data entry later because I

00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:20,550
needed the tables from the game to

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:24,389
associate with the forms in the field in

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:26,880
this case I needed at least 40 tables to

00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:29,910
get the minimum amount of data if I was

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,120
useful and up to 70 to 100 you know to

00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:34,500
flush really everything out so data

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,449
entry was really the biggest part of

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,130
this project but once I had those tables

00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:40,649
entered I didn't have to type that data

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:42,990
in ever again if I didn't want to and

00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:46,350
want some coding after I got those

00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:51,290
tables entered I could just run a

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:54,060
program and fill out my datasheet mostly

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:58,560
here is the page one of the auto filled

00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:01,199
character sheet it has mostly useful

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,600
information here's a second page of the

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,100
character sheet this is really why I

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,490
wanted out of 8 it because there's a lot

00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,930
of class abilities that's which is a lot

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,029
of text to write and it's really used

00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:15,870
for the for the players but in my simple

00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:19,889
program did that just fine and here's a

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:21,779
quick dive into the code I had to use a

00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:24,420
dispatch table because there's a lots of

00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:27,029
things to do and process and you know

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:31,350
this was me getting the hang of dispatch

00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:34,080
tables as well and here's the dispatch

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:37,530
table there's lots of buckets I need to

00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:43,440
the data into and process and look-up

00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:45,990
tables and data in those tables and for

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,330
example you know I grabbed the data from

00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:52,350
the that eight line file and parse out

00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:55,170
things in two different fields pass it

00:15:52,350 --> 00:16:00,780
to other subroutines to fill out the

00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:03,450
other data fields so yeah lots of the

00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:07,350
animal and then here's a small example

00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:09,510
of the character attributes file so for

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,760
a given value here's our The Associated

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:16,110
field names and their associated values

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:19,440
for that value quick snippet of the

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:22,190
class info what the class abilities are

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:27,500
what it could do at that level any

00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:30,060
modifiers and in-game information so

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:33,270
kind of at the end of the time and I

00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,340
can't go to really all the final changes

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,920
I made but I did web fi it if you want

00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:41,610
to after this taco see all of the crazy

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,800
things I figured would be useful for

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:47,790
creating characters and characters for

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:50,190
them so what did I learn automate the

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:52,860
boring tedious things part of my job is

00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:55,500
the system in I was able finally to a

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,150
code a working dispatch table and I

00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,490
really got to give back to the gaming

00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:02,730
community I loved and I was able to fuel

00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:05,520
my creativity for coding and Perl with

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:08,490
the creativity by hobby and the game I

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,500
love to do thank you

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,589
here's some URLs of where you can look

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:16,740
find my programs I wrote for Hyperborea

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:18,959
so my blogging my open source ideas for

00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,199
gaming and worm you can find my slides

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,500
thank you what questions do you have for

00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,500
me

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:38,240
so if you have question either on mutual

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:38,240
safe or ways your own work

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:54,210
trimming it or question any questions I

00:17:51,420 --> 00:18:01,380
mean I got like 20 more slides I can

00:17:54,210 --> 00:18:03,510
give okay continually face equation I

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,309
will interrupt you on that when I reach

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,290
the on that we let you know all right

00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:13,530
we'll just died when you don't pull the

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:16,710
book needs to here we go I just want to

00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:19,770
share because the thing that taught me

00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:24,000
to type was typing in a random treasure

00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:26,370
generator when I learned to type because

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,990
I had to adjust the tables for the game

00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,280
that I preferred and insert new

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:36,270
treasures and stuff like that and so

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:38,270
yeah it's it's cool to see and actually

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:40,710
the first programs I wrote were also

00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:45,270
doing exactly the same thing it was

00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:47,010
after I learned to take cool all right

00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,720
let's see how fast I can get a twenty

00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:52,170
slides in here we go

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,600
bonus content so there's a bigger this

00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:58,980
gaming convention for some time they

00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:01,500
make available the events of the

00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,800
available at the conference and you can

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:07,610
download a CSV file extensions this is

00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,200
all powered by JT sness tabletop events

00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:13,590
and he does a really good job with this

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,880
program badges event submission event

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,290
registration everything you need to know

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,059
to run a con

00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:23,250
however the the CSV file I wish there

00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,640
was more detail and a better way to

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,500
search the events data so I went looking

00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:32,010
it has an API because of course cuz you

00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:34,050
know jakey's great so will this allow me

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:37,140
to grab more detailed event data and

00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:39,970
what do I need to do to do that I can a

00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,790
good API you need to

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:46,740
so I'll gloss over that need to go how

00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:50,350
do you go and tte to get an API key

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,820
breeding the docs you need to figure out

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,420
what the prevention idea of the

00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:57,070
convention is so I'm gonna use for this

00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:59,530
example the kind of Champions event

00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,510
mostly to talk about it's a goal was to

00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:04,120
do gaming and raise funds to help tte

00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,400
survive the club in 1990 panic because

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,640
in-person conventions are like dead for

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,110
a while so with some communiques command

00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,880
line stuff we can find that convinced nd

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:16,180
from the calls the website makes itself

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,280
to create the maintain the website now

00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:21,280
ARBs ID we can just browse to webpage

00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,050
and see what we can see here's a very

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,330
brave enlist of the JSON that the API

00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,830
returns you get a list of events any

00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,840
custom fields you might need to worry

00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,640
about in the events and page it info

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,370
touch you know how many pages of calls

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,690
you have to make and how many events you

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:40,030
should have at the end of your all your

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:42,660
calling here's the basic functions start

00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:46,030
upload zmo file with information

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,980
anything else you need worry about you

00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:51,340
get a winged object so we can hit up the

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,780
API all you want and I figured out you

00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:56,980
had to prime the pump a little bit to

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:58,690
get the data for you get the data so you

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,090
pass in the Conner IDE to your client

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,070
make your request and then you start

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,500
paging through all the data available to

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,480
you so now we just iterate through all

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,070
those pages and pages of data event data

00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,680
parse the data from each page to get

00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:14,500
data subroutine till all the pages have

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,410
been requested next open up a file dump

00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,680
the data into a CSV CSV file format and

00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:24,850
pick the file and you're done and that's

00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:27,420
it well it's kind of thanks

00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,420
