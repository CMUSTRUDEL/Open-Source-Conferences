grid on YouTube okay so we'll start by

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,719
please

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,490
clicking participants and then raise

hand if you have any questions for the

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,250
board I think we're going to start with

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,490
a short presentation by Stewart is that

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:38,730
correct yep nice right

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:40,790
thank you very much Todd right thank you

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,010
all very much for joining this session

00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:47,610
this is an opportunity to hear a little

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,030
bit about TPF what we do many of you

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,129
will already know what TPF is about but

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,129
this is a refresher for those who don't

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,440
and then it's your chance to ask

00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,039
questions so for this session any

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,230
questions

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,210
Todd will pick up and then he'll be

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,970
asking the panel if you'd like your

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,350
questions toward a particular person in

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,520
the panel then please also make that

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:14,040
clear you could use the zoom chat I'm

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,830
not sure if Todd is monitoring slack we

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,689
had a couple of questions on github but

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,500
it's probably easier now just to stick

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:26,220
with the zoom chat and maybe the slack

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,250
channel for now okay so very briefly

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,430
about Clare Foundation North America

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:37,740
registered foundation established in

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:40,439
2000 and operated by volunteers what do

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,170
we do what does a TPF do so governance

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:47,340
and support the bank manager has been a

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,380
significant role in for many years also

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,479
I guess customer services department

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,310
managing stakeholders communicating with

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,009
various different people within the

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,960
community the important bit is it's it's

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,149
the work that the technical people who

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,619
are developing our language are not

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,259
necessarily focused on it's those

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,110
supporting peripheral activities that

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:11,840
are required and it's worth noting that

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,830
the Perl unlike other languages is not

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,960
managed owned the

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,450
- Yahveh or directly governed by any one

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,640
organisation and that's the key reason

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,160
why we why TPF is here it's not a

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,730
commercial entity that is government

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:30,030
governing purlins and raku its

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:32,970
foundation we do our work through

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,400
various initiatives so you may have read

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,740
in previous months some of the

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,510
information around the initiatives that

00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,230
we're working on so community affairs

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:47,520
team has been the focus of the last few

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:50,580
months and this really is to ensure that

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,680
our community and our the things that we

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,620
do are professional a good quality

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,190
welcoming to you people as well as

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,050
supporting our existing people as well

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:03,240
Brandon advocacy the marketing in

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,130
brackets it's not traditional marketing

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,920
as you would do as a company but there's

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,350
those things that we need to do I don't

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,800
have a session tomorrow around

00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,060
Brandon messaging to to focus on that

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,100
but it's about the perception of pearl

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,090
that's that really key point and of

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,130
course there's been lots of comments

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,280
around that following Sawyer's talk so

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,989
it's a very hot topic and we need to we

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,530
need to manage that and organize that

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,030
from the Pearl Foundation volunteer

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,330
support is important we need to do more

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,519
of that we could do with volunteers to

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,480
help us with our volunteer outreach to

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,390
make sure that we're looking after the

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,060
people in our network as well supporting

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,920
development through grants managing

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,090
sponsors as well sponsors need to be

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,330
looked after so there's a customer

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,790
services activity around sponsors we

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,680
need to recently which I think we've

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,660
probably connected up with European

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,330
communities possibly more than previous

00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:02,580
but we still have work to do with with

00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:03,860
further outreach and also some support

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:09,989
around some of the tools and

00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:12,299
infrastructure around pearl and raku I

00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:15,420
mentioned about the community affairs

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,400
team we it matters a lot that we're seen

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,200
as a professional community the

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,540
organisation's who are going to make

00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,510
significant investments in their

00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,270
technology should they choose pearl need

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,650
to have confidence that we

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,229
going to look after them we're going to

00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:34,379
be sustainable that the the community is

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:36,569
well-managed and cohesive so it really

00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,129
is important that we we manage that so

00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:41,580
this is where the community affairs team

00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:45,060
is one of our first initiatives has been

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:48,419
launched the people within that are

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,520
funded they've been trained and they are

00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,900
there all through the year I'm repeating

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,970
some of the things I mentioned at the

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,659
opening session but there has been an

00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,250
important part of what we're doing we

00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:01,319
need volunteers there's all sorts of

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,569
things we need we have we can always

00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:05,039
Todd could do with people supporting him

00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,560
he's got a great team already there's

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,720
other conferences as well

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,280
that happen or that could happen things

00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,190
are obviously a bit strange at the

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,190
minute but we'll see what happens in

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:18,539
coming years you can see there's a list

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,750
of things so there's all sorts of things

00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:23,729
that we could do with support with so if

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,379
you are interested in helping non

00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:27,360
technically or even if you know somebody

00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:28,740
who's not a developer someone you work

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,889
with who's involved in some of these

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,330
other non developer activities then

00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:36,360
maybe you could introduce them if they

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:40,409
want to help a foundation as well with

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,050
with both pearl and rocky so various

00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:44,639
volunteer roles had questions to you

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,110
there's some questions there on there

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,020
I'll leave those for you to think about

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,520
you might have your own questions so

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,759
we'd like to hear your responses to

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,750
these and now if I can hand to Todd

00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:00,259
who's going to moderate questions and

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:04,830
welcome you to ask whatever you'd like

00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:07,380
so I had one quick suggestions to her I

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,330
think the board members in this session

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,090
should introduce ourselves so people

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,060
know who's who of course yes please well

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:17,370
would you stop I guess I'll start so hi

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,060
my name is save roles key I've been on

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:23,909
the board I think like you're gonna have

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,800
I want to say I honestly don't remember

00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:29,509
exactly when I started

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,490
and recently I've been helping out with

00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:37,770
some of the community affairs team stuff

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:40,610
as well as trademark things and doing

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,699
some email admin for us as well

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:47,930
on to somebody else I'll pick Stuart

00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:48,740
since you're next in will this right yep

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,050
thank you very much

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,080
okay so McIntosh I've been with the Perl

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:57,199
foundation very short time since

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,330
September I've been involved with the

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:05,120
with Perl as a from a technological

00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:07,520
perspective since the mid-90s and I must

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,719
say I was involved in something that

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,400
most people I talk to you don't know

00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:15,440
about a thing called mini event from

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,569
Mike Heinz absolutely very very good

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,219
piece of technology and worked very well

00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:20,539
for me very surprised that not many

00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:22,430
people have heard about that but anyway

00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:24,740
that's what I've that's what got me into

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,889
Perl I've been on the outside I have

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,139
polled developers who I work with they

00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:32,409
were very much involved but was

00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:35,810
introduced to the Perl Foundation

00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:37,610
possibly because I was outside of the

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,009
community and maybe bring a different

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,159
perspective so that's me

00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:49,789
you're the board president and I'm the

00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:50,270
president thank you very much all right

00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:53,990
there we go

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:57,050
my name is Makoto and I am helping TPF

00:07:53,990 --> 00:08:00,229
for I think 10 years I studied as a

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,020
volunteer and I am still about here but

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:07,069
I am I was a volunteer grant manager

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:10,190
then grant grant chair now helping the

00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:17,389
board has secretary writing Paul for

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:20,509
more than 20 years okay I'll go we

00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:25,940
should which made a list I am Ricardo

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:31,490
Cygnus are jbs I was the pumpking for

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:33,199
several years in the late 2000s and I've

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,630
been on the board for I guess about two

00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:38,029
years now something like that I've also

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,190
released a whole lot of Perl code so you

00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:42,289
are probably unfortunately affected by

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,440
my software work as well as my board

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,440
work

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:52,610
hello I'm Peter cross-check I'm

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,509
currently the treasurer of TP f I've

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,920
been on the board for less than a year I

00:08:55,509 --> 00:09:03,620
officially assume the treasurer role

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:06,470
back in January and I'm just helping out

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,110
at the moment getting acclimated with

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,329
everything that we do much as I imagine

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:17,480
all of you are about to become familiar

00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:19,220
with I am

00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,290
Curtis Pope better note that many of you

00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,350
is oven I've been packing them pearl for

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,449
about 20 years now obviously I've

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,790
released a fair amount of Perl code

00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:31,930
mostly it's the testing tools they've

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:34,579
worked on which you're familiar with the

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,410
tap parser which is currently shipped

00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:38,029
with for variety of other things

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,790
including tests class moves which

00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:44,930
despite its flaws I'm rather happy about

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:46,430
so and I'm working on a new system the

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:53,420
Corporal language hopefully that'll get

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:54,259
adopted hello I'm mark I'm the

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,000
interloper

00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:58,819
I am the ugly duckling going to South

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,920
East once I am NOT on the board but I've

00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:04,069
been involved in stalking Poe people for

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,250
about 20 years or so and doing various

00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:10,100
all sorts of community marketing

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:13,009
organizing things so I get asked to come

00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,199
along I am the Claire of the Marketing

00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:16,670
Committee I have also been on various of

00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:20,620
the community committees with the POE

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,620
foundation for more than a decade I

00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:35,720
think the team okay renamed you guys so

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,029
that you will be so people will be able

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:49,699
to see what your position is if I get it

00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:56,630
got it wrong I apologize treasurer mr.

00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:58,279
up spouts darker as well yeah Todd do

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,529
you have any questions we have two

00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,740
queued from the

00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:05,930
get up shall we start with those yeah I

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,480
think so nobody yet has raised their

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,300
hand right no problem at all okay so

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:19,240
have two questions firstly there is a

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:21,770
question the status of pearl dock so the

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,510
and I note from them around regarding

00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,400
the question for dock especially in

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:28,310
viewer Sawyer's mentioned of the docks

00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,070
during the keynote so the challenge with

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:33,440
pearl dock is that the documentation is

00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,180
thorough but it's quite hard to manage

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,130
partly because it includes core

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,710
documentation tutorials references

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,730
there's a lot of different types of

00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,490
documentation and they're not

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:48,100
necessarily categorized in a way that's

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:51,430
easy to pass there's also the FAQ

00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:53,630
sections being accused 1 to 9 and

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,580
there's other information that makes it

00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,110
quite difficult the opportunity with

00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,080
pearl 7 is to change some of the habits

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:03,070
that have been around the documentation

00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:06,470
and potentially improved some of that so

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:09,470
so yes pearl dock needs some work

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:11,750
it needs a community around it it needs

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,279
a handover from what's gone before it

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,320
needs some some of that knowledge and

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,459
learning fed back into the the community

00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,770
around it

00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:20,660
and that then aligned with some of the

00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:23,959
opportunities that making some changes

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:26,060
around well 7 and onwards can make it

00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,350
could be that the grants program could

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,970
be available to help some of the work

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:33,050
there as well so certainly on the radar

00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,279
but we need to build that community and

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,620
it may well be that those people here

00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:38,870
who want to volunteer to get behind that

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,900
as well and we can work on that

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:45,110
collectively can I just add one thing

00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,670
please yes so the question was also

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:51,740
focusing on the product of parola

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:53,420
org site just just a reminder TBF tis

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,279
not like we're not a group of people

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,520
doing the technical work I mean some of

00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:02,390
us also do pearl stuff as well like over

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:05,570
to me many of us but TBF doesn't like

00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:08,329
dictate the technical direction of this

00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:11,030
stuff so you know it's a volunteer

00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:12,240
project like many others and the Stewart

00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,740
venture and

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,120
people want to submit a grant request to

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,170
work on it that is certainly something

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:24,370
that would make sense

00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:27,610
yeah we don't it's not like what Cody

00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:35,199
and just get me it's up to you everybody

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:36,940
in the audience thank you okay I think

00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:39,790
we have two questions you won't go to

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:44,050
those or do you want to finish your get

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:53,170
up there's one other one we can pick up

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:55,509
from github which is yes so basically

00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:59,860
there are some questions being asked

00:13:55,509 --> 00:14:02,410
around the status of p5p what's gonna

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,149
happen with rocku they're gonna have

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,949
their own community they do have their

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,720
own community and as technologies get

00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:09,130
larger those communities need to be

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,269
organized so they can direct your

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:16,120
efforts better so we want to help rocku

00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:18,100
thrive and in order to do that we've

00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,870
reached out recently to some of the more

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,110
prominent rock community leaders to get

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,730
a better idea of who might be willing to

00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,050
participate in this effort in particular

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,149
if they're possible it would be lovely

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:31,420
if we had some rocky representation in

00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:32,949
TPF and even on the board level so we're

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,529
waiting to hear back from them to find

00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:37,779
out what that is we have our own ideas

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,540
about what it might help to take them

00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:42,579
build a community and either work within

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,680
TPF or if they want you to create their

00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:47,470
own foundation but in order for this to

00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,939
happen we can't impose our visions we

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,300
have to understand what their vision is

00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:55,209
so it's hard for us to give any specific

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,850
answers because we can't commit to what

00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:59,170
they are going to do and so we're trying

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,449
to work with them to find the best way

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:07,540
of moving forward on that so that's me

00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:08,920
saying I don't know then I did I cover

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:16,000
anything was anything I miss them that

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:24,820
really okay the first question is from

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:28,100
Carl hi so about that pearl dock and

00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:32,120
pearl I don't know remember the download

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:38,780
Pearl psyched so you cannot download

00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:43,040
curl 532 yet and there's a pull request

00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:45,670
from the pumpkin to put that in but if

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,560
the pumpkin can't get a pull request

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:52,340
paid attention to then probably nobody

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:55,910
can and so maybe this should be a there

00:15:52,340 --> 00:16:02,800
should be some paid not just grant but

00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:07,810
maybe so some paid time devoted to it

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:10,960
the the the Pearl dock is off-putting to

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:15,950
newcomers because say the links don't

00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:17,390
don't work you get 404s I'm told people

00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,850
were complaining about this in the

00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:22,550
hallway chat yesterday in fact several

00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:30,860
people were so it doesn't present a very

00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:34,970
professional appearance perception to

00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:37,970
newcomers or to pearl come here and not

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,820
be able to to follow a link to a

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:44,000
particular document so it seems like we

00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:47,840
ought to be investing somehow and

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:55,040
perhaps not rely on volunteer entirely

00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:58,400
work on it yes yes that's race again in

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,830
plie a very important point then I think

00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,950
what we can do is we can take that away

00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:05,689
and see if we can get something we can

00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,610
react to that quite quickly I hadn't

00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:10,100
realized that it was issues with 404s

00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:15,620
and as you say the pumpkin pumpkins not

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:17,630
getting a response there yeah I was

00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,630
gonna say something that was mentioned

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:23,060
earlier is you know Dave said so solving

00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,280
problem X is is for the community to do

00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,439
and I think that that is often true and

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,820
the thing that the thing that we need to

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,900
improve on both sides of this discussion

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:34,580
is the way in which the community can

00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,410
say you know we had to solve this

00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,520
problem and we found a solution and we

00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,890
want the solution to keep

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,570
going even after the people who found it

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,550
interesting to solve had found other

00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:46,550
things to do and what we've had happen

00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:48,890
repeatedly in every open-source project

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,350
but also in many of pearls is have

00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,320
someone say well I made it I solved the

00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,970
problem and pretty soon it'll be I can

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,410
open it up and people can use it and

00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,000
install it anywhere and first of all

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,350
install it anywhere it doesn't really

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,090
solve the problem because what you want

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,850
is a canonical installation of it and

00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:07,100
secondly the canonical and installation

00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:10,370
then ends up being the thing that the

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,140
person feels is done right I've proved

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,000
it out there and now it now I can let it

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,490
lie fallow and that leads to the

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,760
situations we have now right the the get

00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:20,990
Pearl site worked and eventually the

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,490
work cease to be interesting because it

00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,860
was entirely content related and not

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,380
technology and pearl box similarly right

00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,930
pearl dot Perl org worked and then it

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,820
became content management and I think

00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:36,380
that it would be good to establish a

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:38,900
culture between TPF and resource

00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:42,020
creators whereby we can find a way to

00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,870
facilitate shared ownership right where

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,850
we can say you can come to us and we can

00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,220
help use our channels and communication

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,830
to find a way to take group ownership

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,050
where the role of TPF which has a

00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:57,050
limited number of volunteers can largely

00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,400
be owning the keyring right and saying

00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,490
we can make sure someone can always

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,420
maintain this now I'm I will say I'm

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,890
speaking off-the-cuff this is not

00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,060
something the board has officially said

00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,980
we'd like to do but I think it is the

00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:10,340
obvious way in which we can talk about

00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,020
solving this problem maybe that involves

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:15,320
paying volunteers but I think to a large

00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:17,420
extent the issue is rarely volunteers it

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,520
is usually the ability of willing people

00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,560
to get access to running systems and

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,690
that is that's probably the most

00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,690
pressing problem to solve and it's easy

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:33,950
it has a conflict and one of the people

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,400
on the repo is like hey sorry can you

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:41,420
fix the conflict of course Surya sir has

00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,650
probably been busy but I would just

00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,810
point out there hasn't been no BRE

00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,810
sponsor they are discussing

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,040
oh there I mean when I looked at it I

00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,490
think yesterday I had saw nothing like

00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,040
that

00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:59,570
so any okay maybe it's a separate race I

00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:05,660
was a big attention to the typing okay

00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:07,610
the next question is from Joel hope it's

00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,900
okay if I make a couple quick comments

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,510
with regards what we were just talking

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:14,390
about first of all being

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:17,150
I would absolutely echo what Rick said

00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:20,510
the problem I think is often getting

00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:22,760
keys to the tools not just building the

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:25,040
tools having been involved in say

00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,230
medicine and some of those other side

00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,780
projects I also want to say that I know

00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:32,990
Dan book has his own pearl doc browser

00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:36,610
that MS ed pearl dr. yell

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:40,370
I always go to it through P 3rl org

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:42,320
don't link shorten them but you know

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,510
there is a second version of this that

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,200
could be used almost immediately and it

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:50,360
is open sourced on his github then to my

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,950
actual question and I don't know I

00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,250
brought this up at least once but I was

00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:58,640
I have in the past done a TPF brand

00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:02,900
photo was my manager way back in the day

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:06,470
back for alien base I was very

00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:09,290
appreciative of doing that that process

00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:12,920
but it was certainly a big process and I

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:14,600
think as I've gotten to be more you know

00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,100
how should I say a professional

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,140
developer I was able to do that grant

00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,560
because I was a grad student and I had

00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:24,800
the time you know I'm sort of the free

00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,150
space to be able to work like that and I

00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,950
know that the grant program as it

00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,290
currently exists might be well optimized

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:34,250
for someone like contractor who may have

00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:36,760
gaps in his his or her time coming up

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:39,890
you apply for a grant ahead of time

00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,300
satellite current contract is ending I'm

00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,310
going to apply for a three-month grant

00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,870
to do some great big project and then

00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,820
you know when it's done I get paid and

00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,070
everything's good but for someone like

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,890
me now who is you know steadily employed

00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:53,360
it has some kids has some time in the

00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:56,210
evenings but not enough to even really

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,950
think about applying for a grant could

00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:01,290
it be possible that the TPF could have

00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:04,049
some curated list of we will pay

00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:08,570
500 bucks if someone could attack this

00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:11,010
bug or if someone could you know on

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:14,370
unscrew up the permissions for some

00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:16,440
service that needs to be you know Lee or

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:19,140
something you know have things that

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,450
people could pick up quickly and have it

00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,360
to fill my complete bounty system yes

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,070
exactly and security fixes their good

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,080
one to a map because they have the most

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:31,230
important so we could have that for that

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,940
and I think that would fit was with that

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,380
sort of non contractor people would be

00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,150
happy to knock out some of these bugs

00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,940
but we don't even really have time to

00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:40,950
submit a full proposal and do that whole

00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,020
thing whereas I know that people would

00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:45,960
be happy to have certain of those fixed

00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,790
but you know if it could be something

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,380
you can just pick off of a pick up off

00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:51,990
of a pile and handle that would be

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,970
excellent thank you I think that's a

00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,770
really good suggestion would you be

00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:59,340
willing to work with us to develop that

00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:01,350
further absolutely yeah brilliant well

00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,390
then that's that would be the takeaway

00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:05,520
from this we can follow up afterwards

00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,860
work out what it would what we would

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,210
need to do to make that easy for you and

00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:15,179
then with other people I have a couple

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:19,140
additions by the way Joe off long time

00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:21,270
no see one like Joe said and like Joe

00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:27,059
did in the past we have a grant program

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:31,049
we open the call for grants every two

00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:32,669
months and earlier it was free every

00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:36,120
three months and it is every two months

00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:39,480
and the max amount is 10k u.s. dollars

00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,929
so if you have ideas then feel free to

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,660
apply the grants and fold up bounty

00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:48,390
ideas actually we have a community site

00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:52,919
grant spot Foundation dr. G let me let

00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:56,220
me pass it here yeah right he has a

00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:59,309
place where we can exchange ideas I want

00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,950
to I want to help us can somebody do it

00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:06,059
and then potentially Paul foundation can

00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:08,610
give grant of course we cannot pay grant

00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:11,790
for it anybody everybody but still right

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:13,770
here's a place to exchange ideas so you

00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,970
can take you can take idea from here

00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:18,350
while you can

00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:27,360
modified open issue in github and then

00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:39,090
submit new ideas okay I think the next

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:45,450
question is from Tommy Butler he's off

00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:46,860
me it but we're not hearing anything you

00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:49,140
may be muted on your headset or

00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:53,809
something Tommy the double mutant

00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,809
problem is very common one and meetings

00:24:53,990 --> 00:25:01,260
double mute is an unmute nono where

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:04,140
you're muted in the software and then I

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:07,890
was trying to make a joke my body okay

00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:13,650
are you able to hear me now yeah okay

00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:17,250
sorry I linux okay so I appreciate the

00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:19,230
opportunity to speak with TPF or this is

00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,330
actually really awesome and I'm a little

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:24,000
nervous because I'm coming to you as

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:28,470
somebody who really just rattles around

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:33,260
the community and volunteers and I've

00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:35,640
been using Perl for 21 something years

00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:39,090
but I haven't really gotten involved in

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,830
any kind of conferences with the

00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:43,169
exception of one time when I was able to

00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:46,559
attend in Texas it's just work life

00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:48,750
always very busy and so that's kind of

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,159
the angle that I'm coming that or I

00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,500
should say that's the lens that I look

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,000
at pearl with I look at the lens

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,460
or sorry I look at pearl through the

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,740
lens of somebody who uses pearl for a

00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,320
living and somebody who's been doing so

00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:05,400
for a long time and the pearl that I use

00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:07,470
for our living is Pro pro 5 now going to

00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,809
be pearl 7 so very excited about that

00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:13,500
talk a little bit about that with the

00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:15,299
community last last night the question

00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,490
I'm coming to you with is a little bit

00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:19,169
about and please forgive me if I'm

00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:22,260
coming to you with a question that is a

00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:25,200
little without context because I don't

00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:28,500
have a lot of context but admittedly I'm

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,680
trying to get get those answers now

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,710
so the question is around direction

00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,780
where where does TPF want to take Pearl

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,550
for me it's abundantly clear where the

00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:42,680
community kind of want to take kind of

00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:45,090
wants to take Pearl I've seen stuff on

00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,490
for example and on the Facebook group

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:50,010
where I volunteer I've seen well

00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:52,530
Braswell's idea for the Pearl community

00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:56,730
route roadmap that has a lot of very

00:26:52,530 --> 00:27:00,030
lofty ideas goals that I think are good

00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:02,370
to strive for and I'm wondering what is

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,990
TPS direction for Pearl where do we want

00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,560
to take Pearl what do we want to do with

00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,160
Pearl

00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:16,740
are we just happy with where we are can

00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:18,690
you kind of clue me in so from TPS

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:22,080
perspective as was mentioned earlier

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:24,060
when we're not taking Pearl the

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,560
development as such we're not directing

00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:28,830
that but we are supporting and we are

00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:32,070
working with some of the core developers

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:34,680
we were in conversation with Sawyer and

00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:38,310
the team regarding some of the divisions

00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:40,320
and the objectives that they had so our

00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:44,250
job here is to support the things around

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,920
that and and make sure that pearl and

00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:49,440
raku have every opportunity open to them

00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:54,000
that's what we're here for

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,620
of course we want pearl to be at the the

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,880
front we have a lot of aspirations for

00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,520
Pearl I think that will come through

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,770
with other initiatives that we've got

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,330
coming on in the near future and again

00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:07,140
through the marketing activities

00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:09,110
advocacy brand new messaging we will

00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:14,280
bring some of that out

00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:16,530
but it's not for TPF to be saying this

00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,200
this is what we want the development

00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,190
team the core development team to do but

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,200
we will work with them there'll be

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,090
things that maybe we'll discuss because

00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,730
the community wants them it may well be

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,800
that sponsors want to influence the

00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,880
direction and and manage that either

00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,760
through grants or through other

00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,730
activities but it at this point in time

00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,320
it's very much working together between

00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,770
the organization if the non-technical

00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,210
activities and the technical activities

00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:46,020
so I think that's that's kind of how we

00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:48,000
now I'm not sure if there's a proposal

00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:52,680
or a suggestion that maybe we should be

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:56,490
more or less involved in that I've had

00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:59,130
to watch Garrett's lien being a lot a

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,990
lot of mix with the community side of

00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:03,840
the TPF and the marketing side for a

00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:05,250
long period of time I get this a lot a

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,010
lot of people in the community see the

00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:10,290
TPF as the head of a body and that's not

00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:12,270
really what it is it's more the fact

00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,160
that the community's made up of lots of

00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:16,650
different gears they're not connected

00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,050
together and TPF is merely a claim that

00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:21,840
links all those gears together so we

00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:24,540
don't actually do any role we more make

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,130
you guys connect and that should be the

00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,360
role of the TPF we should be the

00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,880
connecting between all these different

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,380
gears all these different facets of our

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,930
community should be able to spin on

00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,430
their own do their own thing and the TPF

00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:39,660
have merely enabled that they work

00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:42,060
together and don't see as we're guiding

00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:46,410
you it's that we don't move unless you

00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:47,910
move that's a very interesting analogy I

00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:50,670
mean I don't think that there's any

00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:53,430
denying the influence that TPF has in

00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,300
terms of where they decide to invest

00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:57,780
their dollars

00:29:54,300 --> 00:30:00,570
I mean dollars drives development in

00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:02,640
many cases i I've never taken money for

00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,140
anything that I've done with Perl but I

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,600
know that other people do depend on

00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,670
those grants in order to move forward

00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,500
with their projects and when TPF makes

00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:13,200
the decision to fund one project versus

00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,510
another it is a little bit influential

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,850
so I don't want to just dismiss that out

00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,910
of hand I can answer that though the

00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:22,140
entire the grants committee is

00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:23,880
volunteers and it can be any volunteer

00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,580
from the community so anybody can be

00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,740
sitting meeting those decisions and also

00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:31,290
to that the sponsorship money itself can

00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,240
be targeted by the person responses so

00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:35,190
for instance there was a thing a few

00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,850
years back where many responses only for

00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:37,530
Perl sets

00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:41,520
although that money just went to water

00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:44,160
pulsates the they call foundation grants

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,050
for towards pelt five core and all of

00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,870
that money went to the profile core and

00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:51,090
enhancing the profile core and so we're

00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:54,360
not actually deciding where that when he

00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:56,010
goes it's more that is either targeted

00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,470
for a specific thing

00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:00,450
or a group of volunteers drawn from the

00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,850
community decide whether when he goes

00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:04,710
the TPF is an organization don't just go

00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,210
oh we'll spend the money on that the

00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:08,280
only time they ever actually do that is

00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,320
in terms of conferences and that's

00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,420
merely just to help support conferences

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,730
because it's a big risk and a big

00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:17,190
financial risk run in a conference so

00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:19,860
again it's more of a perception problem

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,330
it looks like we have power but actually

00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:24,510
we're not we're again led by the

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:26,550
community I just might add one more

00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:28,770
thing about the grants is that all the

00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:31,110
grants are posted on the news not Pro

00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:33,240
foundation.org site all the proposals I

00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,070
should say and there's a public comment

00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,730
period for a reason which is the grants

00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,160
committee

00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:40,590
well volunteers from the community also

00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,580
wants to hear opinions from the

00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:46,260
community at large

00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:49,290
I imagine that but I'm sure if you know

00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,580
proposal were / were posted and the

00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,830
grants committee was like oh that sounds

00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:55,200
good and then a whole bunch of people in

00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:56,460
the community know this won't this isn't

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,610
a good idea because it acts they're

00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,200
gonna listen to that and vice versa if

00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,180
the community is you know super strongly

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,810
in favor of it that's gonna have a big

00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:08,790
influence so like Mark said we're not

00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:10,590
sitting around with like big puddles of

00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,430
money and just deciding what to do with

00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:15,000
it

00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:18,450
we're facilitating basically we are we

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,940
are a facilitation for taking money from

00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:22,220
mostly companies and spending it in ways

00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,740
the community as a whole

00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:27,690
thinks is a good idea okay this does

00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:31,020
help clear up some misconceptions on my

00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:33,570
part and it helps me understand a little

00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:36,390
bit better what questions to ask next

00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:39,810
which would be how do people who like me

00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:43,080
who are more like I said we're I'm

00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:44,970
focused on Perl for my work or what I do

00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,910
to volunteer in the community how do

00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:52,590
people like me get involved and and help

00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:55,760
the TPF and also like well I'll just

00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,760
leave it at that question for now

00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:09,610
Thank You Todd do we have further

00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:13,170
questions I you muted that one we do we

00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:19,300
do not I was just asking in chat so far

00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:22,030
nobody has responded no I can go back to

00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,740
answering the end of Thomas question of

00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:25,330
how do you help well you literally just

00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,760
volunteer and say what you want to do

00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,440
what you think you can do and hopefully

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,690
there'll be something you can do there's

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,940
plenty of as as already said there's

00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,920
plenty of different initiatives inside

00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,780
what the foundation is connected to

00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,190
there's certainly plenty of things

00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,780
they've done in terms of code that's

00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:43,480
clear stuff they've done in terms of

00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,160
time that's done with marketing which in

00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,800
my personal opinion not enough is spent

00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,480
on so there are quite a lot of ways you

00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,820
can volunteer and maybe talking to us I

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,470
think maybe it's been a case of people

00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,970
don't know they can just literally ask

00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,640
some you on the pill foundation how can

00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,260
I help and they'll get a response

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:02,680
because it has been assumed that this

00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:05,080
lists head and a body but it's not it's

00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:11,050
their gears and we're just connecting

00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:12,670
the gears and yes some specific things

00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,720
that I know we have open right now we're

00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,310
looking people to help out with

00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:19,870
Community Affairs team which is super

00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:22,180
dimension I'm sure there's lots of other

00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:23,410
specific things we can think of I don't

00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,690
know if we're looking for grants

00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:28,120
committee members at the moment we are

00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:31,420
interested in talking or Rako people for

00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,710
the board I'm sure there's lots of

00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,120
things I'm not thank you for the moment

00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:38,470
Stuart are there other things you would

00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:40,900
like to add to that list yeah so I'm so

00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:43,390
from a volunteers point of view we've

00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:45,130
had in the last few months quite a few

00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:49,120
new volunteers joining various

00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:51,940
initiatives and activities but I think

00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:54,370
what we need is more people supporting

00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,500
the volunteers so people whose role is

00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:58,600
there to communicate with the volunteers

00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:02,680
and make sure that they have what they

00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:05,230
need the risk is that a volunteer is

00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,320
busy doing the activity that they're

00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:10,960
there to do but maybe lose contact with

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,880
the Pearl Foundation or other people so

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,010
we need some air reach some people who

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,660
can join these networks together

00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,849
so if there was if there was a role that

00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,490
I could ask for a volunteer for now it

00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:24,520
would be one or two people who could

00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:27,220
look after our existing volunteers and

00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,839
make sure they have what they need so

00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:32,049
that would be that would be a volunteer

00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:35,650
on a stroll now the the cat Community

00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:38,650
Action Team so far it seems to work very

00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:44,069
well we could potentially do with one of

00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:44,069
one or two people to add to that

00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:49,329
marketing again join us on tomorrow if

00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:51,430
you're interested in marketing because

00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:53,140
we need to work out what that means to

00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,119
us it's not simply here's a marketing

00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:58,930
plan let's go and do it it's it's more

00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:01,210
complex well this is well it's been it's

00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:04,150
been around for a while its broad raku

00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,740
being you there's all sorts of there's

00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:08,200
differences between what needs to happen

00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:10,599
for both of them when it comes to the

00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:15,099
random messaging so anyway we need to

00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:17,079
work on that I think one thing I'm

00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:18,940
really pleased about from through this

00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:21,910
conference is the positive messaging

00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:24,160
following Sawyer's announcement that is

00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:26,680
really good I would I would be asking

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,960
people to be talking about Perl and

00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,089
getting those statements out there it

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,040
happened I think the reaction to it as

00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:36,010
always taught was very positive so very

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,780
pleased to see that and wherever people

00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:40,089
can share that news and keep the

00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:43,359
conversations positive then that's

00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:45,400
welcome but do feedback as well tell us

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,950
what it is like today where you have the

00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,839
opportunity but it's not yesterday the

00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,970
Perl foundation is there to listen all

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,950
the way through so come and tell us when

00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:55,329
something is not right don't let

00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:58,869
something Fester if something's bugging

00:36:55,329 --> 00:37:00,190
you don't let it fester bring it to us

00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:03,819
tell us what it is give us the

00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:06,130
opportunity to to make it work the Perl

00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:08,799
Foundation and the poke communities it's

00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:10,119
a codependent relationship we we're no

00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:12,280
good without the other one the Perl

00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:15,819
foundation is nothing without an active

00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:18,670
healthy community and and also supports

00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:21,130
the the generation and the

00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:23,559
sustainability of that community so we

00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:27,040
all need to work together it's not them

00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:28,750
on us I had a comment friendly comments

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,340
just yesterday around

00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,450
someone who's saying it's good to talk

00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,580
to the people at the top and I

00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:36,130
responsible is if this isn't about being

00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:38,080
at the top this is we have our roles and

00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:41,290
our roles are important but we shouldn't

00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:43,090
be considered as as some kind of

00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:45,400
hierarchy where we're at the top and you

00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,630
shouldn't really talk to us we all need

00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,450
to work together and that's how we're

00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:54,520
going to move forward and we have a

00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:57,310
question from Don okay because then I

00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,200
have a question for the board related

00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,670
what Stewart said what Stewart how do we

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,080
recommend people come to us with those

00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,730
questions what's what's the most

00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,540
effective way for someone to say I have

00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:10,630
a question for or a suggestion for TPF

00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:13,210
so my first response will be the slack

00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,040
channel I'm not sure that works for

00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,150
everyone

00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,390
but there's a there's a good place to

00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:20,920
engage on the blog post that I've put

00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,599
out I've included my email address and

00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:26,530
people have contacted me off the back of

00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:28,150
that so so that there's that possibly

00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:29,980
back to the volunteer management

00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:32,349
possibly we need to get a community

00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:35,710
email address where maybe we can yeah I

00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:37,089
think this sounds like I think I agree

00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:39,550
with everything you said in your answer

00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:40,839
and I think then we get to had to give

00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,160
us that feedback and that's something we

00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:45,849
can do better and we can probably do

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:50,980
that this week so I'll make a note I'm

00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:52,690
sorry thank you I think it's a very good

00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,780
point and a great outcome would be for

00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:58,380
us to publish it a community email

00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,460
address that you can easily use

00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:04,750
sorry talk there was a question you

00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:06,160
wanted to okay go ahead Don hi um and

00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,660
you may have touched on this a little

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,690
bit and I may have missed it and I

00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:14,109
apologize if I did but I do I helped

00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:17,589
organize a local workshop for purl and

00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:20,830
in the past we've been told to try to

00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:23,050
get our local sponsors with try it so we

00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:25,900
use sponsorship from the Pro Foundation

00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:29,109
as a whole to put our events on but we

00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:31,330
often try to find local sponsors at one

00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:32,560
point I think I'm just not sure what

00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:35,260
we're supposed to be doing at this point

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,390
are we supposed to have local sponsors

00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,349
just support the Pearl Foundation and

00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:42,490
then use the Pearl Foundation's

00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:45,359
sponsorships for our two

00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:48,550
- like fund our event or should we be

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:51,580
actively seeking specific local groups

00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:58,869
to sponsor our local event the d.c

00:39:51,580 --> 00:40:01,720
Baltimore pearl workshop so who meets do

00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:04,330
you want to pick this up regarding the

00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:09,849
weather sponsor money should be managed

00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:12,609
centrally or locally so I believe it

00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:16,030
essentially depends on the on the amount

00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:19,000
and purpose of the sponsor money for

00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:21,670
what you're looking to do so if you if

00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,330
you're trying to get a sponsor for a

00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:29,500
meeting space or whatnot TPF almost

00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:31,930
seems like a it would be a good

00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:34,839
intermediary but there's an extra step

00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:36,580
there that may not necessarily be being

00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:39,190
necessary but on the other hand if

00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:41,890
you're trying to organize a like a

00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:45,640
workshop or something like that tape yep

00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:50,530
and TPF involvement would would probably

00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:52,599
be a more useful thing to have so I I

00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:55,119
guess ultimately it depends on on the

00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:57,400
size and type of the sponsorship and if

00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:01,750
you have those sorts of questions please

00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:03,940
feel free to email me those you can

00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,890
actually email treasurer at Pearl

00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:07,960
Foundation org with those sorts of

00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:14,380
questions and we can discuss and get

00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:18,339
back to you on those thank you and I'm

00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:22,540
just picking up some notes around slack

00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:24,760
and I guess yes it's not it's not for

00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,200
everyone it's what Pearl Foundation have

00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,450
used because other people within the

00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,300
Pearl Foundation have used it within

00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:33,820
their organizations but if it does

00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:37,260
become a barrier to us working with our

00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,260
community then we need to revisit that

00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:42,540
okay great next we have a question from

00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,540
sabe

00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:56,400
as microphones unmuted but we're not

00:41:54,310 --> 00:42:04,589
hearing him

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:04,589
you're very distant that's good go ahead

00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:14,020
hello my name is Alvin I'm from Oslo

00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:22,240
Norway in part of Oslo panache for many

00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:25,540
years like 1517 years now actually so I

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:29,460
mean spending some of my time the last

00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:34,390
few years in other organizations than

00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:36,460
community and I've ended up involving

00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:38,829
myself in a large one called the

00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:43,690
internet society and I learned quite a

00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:48,930
lot about a large about how they

00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:51,430
organize a large very heterogeneous

00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:55,810
organization that is international and

00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:59,079
has deep interests in technology and

00:42:55,810 --> 00:43:02,500
making sure it gets out there among

00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:06,160
people their focus is the Internet and

00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:10,210
access to that I still see a whole lot

00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:13,210
of commonalities between that community

00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:16,180
and the per community and that's one

00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:20,170
thing I would like to just shortly bring

00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:23,230
here for your consideration the first

00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:28,660
and most important thing I've learned is

00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:31,720
that the board there and which is a

00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:33,670
basically organizational body and the

00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:37,030
Board of Trustees which is an advisory

00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:42,130
body and the support organization in

00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:44,650
that that community they don't make a

00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:47,619
lot of decisions are all much like the

00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:51,040
TPF doesn't make a lot of decisions but

00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:54,030
they do have some decision power for

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,880
things that are relevant for everybody

00:43:54,030 --> 00:44:00,369
and what I would have loved to see is

00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,700
that the PPF

00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:07,930
took a proper consideration about trying

00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:09,970
to find a way to get a mandate to make

00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:13,869
such decisions on behalf of the per

00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:16,359
community now the type of decisions of

00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:19,630
course shouldn't be any type of decision

00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:23,890
I'm looking for a very narrow type of

00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:26,490
mandate for example in the things that

00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:28,960
are non-technical but still very

00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:31,750
community relevant or something that

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,660
binds us together and things that could

00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:37,270
qualify for something like that is say

00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:40,660
for example the question of purl

00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:42,250
community logo that is in my opinion

00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:45,280
something we really don't have at the

00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:47,099
moment the per foundation has an onion

00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,650
which is confusing with the Tor project

00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:54,820
there are all the kinds of logos here

00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:57,670
and there but nothing really that we can

00:44:54,820 --> 00:45:00,640
visually use to punish each other and I

00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:05,130
said bind us together as like one

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:10,660
community and we have very few if any

00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:13,869
ways of speaking in unison because there

00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:16,240
is no coordinating body I understand now

00:45:13,869 --> 00:45:18,880
that this is a little bit about to

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:22,420
change now with the current generation

00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,430
in the foundation board and the

00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:28,920
marketing effort is going and going on

00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:37,450
there which is awesome but some of those

00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:41,109
things that help us basically become an

00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:43,210
actual community that where we can go

00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:46,720
out there into the world and show that

00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:50,290
we are part of this community or in more

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:53,400
let's call it coordinated manner I think

00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:57,220
would be a good thing but that requires

00:45:53,400 --> 00:46:01,690
a little bit of truth spa to Co say so

00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:04,150
to say from from somebody and form in my

00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:08,619
opinion having followed this community

00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:11,170
for as long as I have I think the

00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:13,710
natural choice for me would have been

00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:16,690
the pro foundation

00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:23,800
for a long time ago and in many ways

00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:28,230
still are so I would urge and ask you to

00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:32,880
a few guys in the bird in the EPF board

00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:37,450
see if there's a way where you can

00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:39,280
gather a mandate in some way I don't

00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:43,660
know how you would go about doing that

00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:46,060
it might be over a year or two gathering

00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:48,100
votes at pearl events have

00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:51,790
representatives from the different

00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:56,460
stakeholder groups bring their votes

00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:58,840
from their groups to a central venue

00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:01,300
anything you I'm sure you figure out a

00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:06,700
good way of doing that but just the act

00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:10,750
of having a real mandate that allows you

00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:13,150
to make decisions that are meaningful on

00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:16,170
behalf of the community so that we can

00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:20,380
become a stronger community and have

00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:24,520
better ability to go out in a concerted

00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:26,560
manner to do our outreach which we badly

00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,610
need would be badly anything that's for

00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:31,270
like ever

00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:33,460
I think that would be a super useful

00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:36,190
step forward and I hope that you guys

00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:42,520
would like to consider that properly in

00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:46,770
the time forward okay thank you

00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:51,100
so so I would be interested to find out

00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:53,650
more about where where that where the

00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:55,270
feeling is that that mandate is needed I

00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:58,510
guess the difference between where we

00:47:55,270 --> 00:48:01,000
are today and what would that then give

00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:02,290
us it certainly needs exploring and I

00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,550
think your proposed will be very

00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,540
interesting

00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,890
it might work with some other

00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:07,420
initiatives we've got but it's really

00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:09,490
about the objective should we have that

00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:12,310
what could we then do that we couldn't

00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:16,750
do today yeah that's that's a good

00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:22,030
exploration to and my main point in

00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:25,780
suggesting this is to change your idea

00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:28,930
of what your role in the what your idea

00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:31,660
in the of your role in the community is

00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:34,840
right now like Mark said you are more

00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:38,890
like a chain that gotta make sure that a

00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:44,230
bunch of wheels work together which is a

00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:47,410
fine picture but still this house like a

00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:50,110
few decision types of decisions that we

00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:53,950
should be able to do as a community

00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:56,050
which we cannot do because there there's

00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:59,890
nobody there to do it with there's not

00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:03,420
no governing body there's no no one who

00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:07,330
will raise their hand and and gather the

00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:12,820
the mandate so to speak to to actually

00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:15,370
do that on a real way okay well I think

00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:16,990
we should possibly explore that further

00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:19,510
unless there's other people who would

00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:20,830
like to use the time now to do it but I

00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:23,610
certainly think it warrants further

00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:31,060
conversation around that with the board

00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:33,010
thank you very much okay I apologize if

00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:36,430
I miss anything in chat it's it's been

00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:39,010
flying by in zoom Carl has a question

00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:42,100
with his hand raised we technically have

00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:44,140
one minute left but we have a soft five

00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:50,570
minutes if we need to close up this

00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:53,420
conversation um so just

00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:55,220
even though you guys saw just gonna say

00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:58,700
about the infrastructure there's these

00:49:55,220 --> 00:50:03,170
things that seem to just get worse and

00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:06,260
it somehow it seems if I publicize it to

00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:09,380
the board there might be somebody

00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:15,830
listening so what a minor inconvenience

00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:19,880
is that since we moved to github we get

00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:22,790
an email every several days saying

00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:26,990
there's been no action and yeah there's

00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:30,800
a server that nobody here has access to

00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:33,290
that Tim he wasn't able to be migrated

00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:36,440
to github somehow and I have no idea I

00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:38,960
could set up a message filter to throw

00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:41,240
yes so can I can I drop in here Karl

00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,670
because I get that email too

00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,550
I have I had gone down a bit of a rabbit

00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:48,500
hole on that one simply because I get

00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:51,110
that email and it's it's not a great

00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:53,990
look and what it seems to come down to

00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:55,880
is that server has detached itself from

00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:57,560
our universe and is connected only

00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,930
through a gateway that lets it send mail

00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:02,020
to pro/5 porters no one no knows where

00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:06,740
it is how to fix it has access to it and

00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:07,880
the operators of Perl org which again a

00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,650
community run service where the

00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,420
infrastructure is effectively privately

00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:14,630
held and not in escrow by the Perl

00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:16,100
Foundation are very nervous about the

00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:20,810
idea of trying to filter those messages

00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:23,360
out at the boundary so I think that

00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,930
there's two answers here and one is I'm

00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,560
on it

00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:28,820
I want to get this to go away they're

00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,500
not they're not great

00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:32,450
it was simultaneously yesterday I got

00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,830
the you know pro 7 has been released and

00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:36,230
also there's been no activity in Perl

00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:38,930
which was it's a strange world we live

00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:41,000
in and the other part of that the

00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:42,920
problem is going back to infrastructure

00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,600
and how is it that we can establish an

00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,850
escrow or a sharing of control of this

00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,560
infrastructure so that when the people

00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:51,230
who have traditionally managed the email

00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,670
servers say I just can't I'm too

00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:54,500
concerned that if I touch it it's gonna

00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:56,750
fall apart and then it's all my problem

00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:58,880
and instead we can say can we establish

00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:01,190
some people who can come in work where

00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,260
control is being held in a safe way and

00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:04,210
we can make these changes without being

00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,369
concerned that it's

00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:07,780
to fall apart and if it means that we

00:52:06,369 --> 00:52:09,160
have to pay some money to do it we can

00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,070
consider that but right now the way

00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:13,240
things stand if I had if I had ten

00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:16,390
thousand dollars to fix this problem

00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:18,010
there's no one to take it so I think on

00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:19,450
the specifics we're doing what can be

00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:21,730
done on the general I think that there

00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:22,960
is a general means for that we need to

00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:26,530
investigate and I hope that answers your

00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:31,930
question okay but here's another Ivan I

00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:34,780
beg Kenna can I follow up on the PPF or

00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:36,450
we we have a couple resources in profile

00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:39,550
Porter's that over the years have been

00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:44,770
generously donated by different

00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:47,470
companies and what what what has come up

00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:51,220
is related to this email and to other

00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:53,410
things is that what happens is over time

00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:56,619
people at those companies kind of fade

00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:58,690
away and it becomes more difficult to

00:52:56,619 --> 00:53:02,490
interact with that it really actually

00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:06,550
seems like it might be time for TPF to

00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:10,420
fund something on digital ocean or

00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:12,609
Amazon or some other service where they

00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:14,740
actually owned and paid for the that

00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:17,560
infrastructure has that been discussed

00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:19,599
with would the board be open to that so

00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,339
I think the the action at this point

00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,650
would be to get a few people together

00:53:21,339 --> 00:53:27,490
from the community and have a have a

00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:29,589
committee as we have the community

00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:31,800
affairs committee and so on whose

00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:34,810
interest is improving the infrastructure

00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:36,760
because I think if we if we design as a

00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:40,210
group of 100 people we have so many

00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:42,070
different opinions and tpf again don't

00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:44,160
necessarily want to try and answer these

00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:47,980
but facilitate the right thing so I

00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,630
propose that we we get some some

00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,660
volunteers who would like to be part of

00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:54,970
a group who will who will work to solve

00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:56,619
these problems and proposals forward

00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:59,290
with the full support of the Perl

00:53:56,619 --> 00:54:01,720
foundation but just answer one parrot

00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:03,580
odds question would we spend money on

00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:05,020
that sir stuff sure yeah I mean it

00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:07,750
probably wouldn't be very expensive

00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:10,560
these days with VBS stuff that's

00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:11,940
absolutely a reasonable thing to success

00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:16,289
okay

00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:17,910
I apologize yeah I just want to say

00:54:16,289 --> 00:54:19,109
thank you very much Todd for moderating

00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:21,329
it thank you for the questions that

00:54:19,109 --> 00:54:25,280
we've had and please continue to ask

00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:25,280
