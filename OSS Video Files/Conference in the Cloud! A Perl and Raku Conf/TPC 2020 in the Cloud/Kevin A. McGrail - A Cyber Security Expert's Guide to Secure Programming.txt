no worries whatsoever so all right well

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,470
thank you everybody my name is Kevin a

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,200
McGrail most people on the internet know

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,850
me as kam I work at a company called in

00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,950
for shield where I'm the director of

00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,560
business growth and we do cyber physical

00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:35,040
security for critical infrastructure and

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,660
so what my talk today about is you know

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,910
as it says a cyber security experts

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,920
guide to secure programming the reason

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,070
for this is basically I want to stop

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,680
programmers from being the next cause of

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,329
a cyber security incident so if you

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,910
follow these rules and you kind of do it

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,230
you can you know avoid being a part of

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,559
an incident response when there's an

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,719
issue so a little bit about me let me

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,660
see if I can get the thing to work yes

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,579
there we go so an introduction to me you

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,610
know it's not too important but what is

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,050
important is my security expertise so

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,970
some of the things I've done over the

00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,220
years I work very heavily on the Apache

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,280
spamassassin project I'm the key author

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,260
of the kam CF a rule set for

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,110
spamassassin I helped with the hardware

00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,230
for the first intrusion detection system

00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:24,360
later bought by Cisco I also helped a

00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,910
lot with mine to thing which I'm happy

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,010
to now announce the river and zix has

00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,650
donated that to the McGrail foundation

00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,480
so we'll be continuing running that that

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,200
is a Perl framework I spoke about that

00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,550
last year and with Perl spamassassin and

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,700
mine defang you could do some really

00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,890
really cool things with email security

00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,410
also you know I've had an FBI raid so

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,240
you know I've also had my office filled

00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,610
with penguins and I've got an apology

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,920
letter from the FBI and I had my phone

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,320
lines cut before I was 10 years old so

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,690
don't do the things I did most of this

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,240
is to learn from other people who've

00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:01,770
been through these problems I also have

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,010
an exploding racecar it's one of the few

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:08,069
stories I'll tell today when my driver

00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,989
had blown his engine dumped oil all over

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:14,069
the manifold it exploded in flame and

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:15,390
this fire was so hot that this picture

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:16,230
was actually taken in the afternoon

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,239
about three o'clock

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,690
bright sunny day but that's how much we

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,250
had to overexpose the picture and how

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,900
bright it was that you could barely see

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,090
it when he did it

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,350
my company's logo was on the hood and I

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,540
told him it wasn't straight enough

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,420
to go do it again so any case just

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,480
wanted to add a little story to start

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:39,870
but that does lead into what I call tone

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,090
setters so with the tone setters one of

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,130
the things I like to point out is I will

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,390
use humor I do talk about these things

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,150
with a little bit of tongue-in-cheek

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:51,540
I love referencing company their

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,880
organizations like xkcd wonderful comic

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,630
for comic and administrative information

00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,490
for geeks but that does not you know

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,560
really I don't want you to discount that

00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,270
I'm serious about this I do have people

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,030
that I help people that call me crying

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:09,090
people that send me you know missus

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,640
where they need major major help so the

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,440
main thing here is you know humor is I

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,600
think how I kind of survive dealing with

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,300
this serious stuff please don't take it

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,180
as an insult to the seriousness of the

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,250
situation next thing I want to go over

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,110
is anybody who's working in cyber

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,330
anytime you're doing anything that comes

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,830
in to cyber make sure you have a rules

00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,560
of engagement what's known as an ro e

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,270
what the rules of engagement do is very

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,800
simply set the boundaries that you have

00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,800
what you're allowed to do so for example

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,590
if we're hired to penetration test a

00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,630
device the rules of engagement will say

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,820
what times and what days we can do the

00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,200
work on it might say we're not allowed

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,350
to touch the equipment or allowed to

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,570
dismantle the equipment things like that

00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:53,220
but the key thing is when you're doing

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,350
your program and your security

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,000
assessments you need to make sure you

00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,620
don't break the rules of engagement

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,900
actually actually could be a crime just

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,270
to do that so you want to think about

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,740
what you're doing don't just start doing

00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,080
this stuff don't be the next example

00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,790
that has to call me for help because you

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,320
cut and pasted something off a website

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,210
and you have no idea what was doing and

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,980
now you have the law enforcement people

00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,010
contacting you to ask you why you are

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:19,200
attacking a server you aren't allowed to

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:21,420
so the next thing is kind of the

00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,420
question before we get into my what I

00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,370
call my dirty dozen but you know what

00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,720
makes a high-end security programmer so

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,060
this is kind of the thing that people

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,190
ask me and so the first thing I talk

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,750
about is that you document your concerns

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,850
if you think there's a security issue

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:39,800
write it down

00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:42,430
disclosure is huge and getting a dose of

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,510
transparency is very very

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,030
additionally what I like to see is I

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:51,140
like to see companies that set up a

00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:52,160
community where transparency is prided

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,110
that doesn't mean you can't give

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,300
somebody grief if they caused a big

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,130
security bug but beyond giving them

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,130
grief nothing else they shouldn't be

00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,660
fired for it etc you know code has bugs

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,490
programs have bugs they're gonna have

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,350
security issues it's how you deal with

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,080
them and how you fix them that separates

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,280
you from other programmers the next

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,660
thing I talked about and I'll talk about

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,880
a little more is you got to think evil

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,530
try and think how the bad guys are gonna

00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,570
think think about how people are gonna

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:20,120
use what you've designed and they're

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,980
gonna get into the system the next thing

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,590
you do is what I call proof if you're

00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,300
right or wrong what this means is follow

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,010
your rules of engagement don't exceed

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,260
them but if you think there's a security

00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:32,600
bug in the code that you're designing go

00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,880
ahead and try and make a exploit for it

00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,050
try and prove whether or not you can do

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,640
something with the code that it wasn't

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,160
intended to do especially something with

00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,560
elevated privileges and then when you do

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,810
that ethically disclose the issue that

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,190
be ethically disclosing issues probably

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,660
the most important part there and we'll

00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,780
talk about that a little bit more my

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,400
dirty dozen but I want to hammer a

00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,980
little bit about the think evil because

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,960
there's a pretty famous book in the

00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,510
marketing world called think let's start

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,810
with why excuse it simon Sinek i think

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:04,430
this is me and so for us you know i want

00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,020
to kind of get you with starting from

00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,330
why you need to do this as i talked

00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,280
about i don't want you to be the next

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,530
programmer that i have to grill to say

00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,180
okay what did you do how did they get in

00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,680
one of the hackers do what's the

00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,380
possibility let's go through the code

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,960
find out what what actually caused the

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,730
issue and how to fix it and so we do a

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,650
lot of threat modeling what that

00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,480
involves is we think about it from the

00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,920
bad guys standpoint how are they going

00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,660
to get in how could they get into the

00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,910
servers if they get into the servers

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,550
what can they do with it what can i as a

00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,110
bad guy do with this data and a lot of

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,330
that is very important you have to think

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,440
outside the box with this one of the

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,230
ways that you can get some experience

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,390
doing this mitre has what they call the

00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,400
attack framework the attack framework

00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,100
goes over what is called the tactics

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,470
techniques and procedures or TTP's for

00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,150
bad guys and if you go through it it's

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,220
basically more about reverse engineering

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,969
a hack but you can look how they have

00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,379
documented

00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:59,029
all the various ways of getting into

00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:03,169
systems and think about it from that

00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:05,209
standpoint on the same manner unit 42 at

00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:07,369
Palo Alto Networks also makes what's

00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:10,519
called adversarial play books so these

00:07:07,369 --> 00:07:12,889
are reverse engineering what bad actors

00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:14,629
did how they how they played their game

00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:16,729
their play books and so it's kind of

00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:19,699
like getting the playbook for the

00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:20,839
adversary the opposite football team so

00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:21,619
you can find out what they're gonna do

00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,449
during the game

00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:26,419
same type of thing study their playbook

00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:30,319
and you might refine your tactics to

00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:32,539
defend against it additionally a wasp

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,189
has a great security coding checklist

00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:36,110
it's about 10 pages long

00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:38,089
very simple checkboxes it doesn't go

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,229
into a whole lot of why and that is one

00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,909
of the problems with it but other than

00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:43,429
that if you can check all those boxes

00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:45,919
you're doing really really well on a

00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:48,439
program and you'll see that the thought

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,809
process around this is to get people to

00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:53,229
pass things like an Olsen coding about

00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:55,789
checklist additionally I want to mention

00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:57,739
people who aren't familiar with various

00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:00,559
security frameworks a wonderful one to

00:07:57,739 --> 00:08:01,929
start with is called PCI DSS that's the

00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:04,639
payment card industry data security

00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:06,349
specifications what that is is that's a

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,839
security specification needed so that

00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:11,749
you can hold credit card data or accept

00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:12,979
credit cards and a lot of companies in

00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:15,619
the United States and around the world

00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:17,959
are required to follow PCI DSS

00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:20,360
it's a self-assessment question an error

00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:23,029
or an essay q so you can find it online

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,469
and very easily and you know if you can

00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:26,149
go through that and your network and

00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:28,429
your systems and the design you put in

00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:31,459
place with your entire ecosystem can

00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:32,629
pass a PCI DSS scan you can rest pretty

00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:35,240
well that you've done a good job of

00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:38,599
designing the system to avoid being

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,089
hacked all right next thing the CIA

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,909
triad so this has nothing to do with the

00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:45,110
the CIA agency in the United States this

00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,870
just stands for confidentiality

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,970
integrity and availability it's usually

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,250
talked about being a triangle or a triad

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,529
because you have to decide which things

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,819
are most important and sometimes two of

00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:59,000
them are most important or sometimes

00:08:55,819 --> 00:09:01,689
only one what I mean by that so if you

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,490
have a public website on that website

00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:06,829
confidentiality is not important at all

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,029
it's a public website integrity is

00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,950
important you don't want people to get

00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:12,050
on that website and to face it

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,490
availability might be pretty important

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,830
but let's say it's a normal company and

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,780
you know if you're offline for

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,000
maintenance on a weekend or a holiday no

00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,280
big deal so in that particular case in

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,220
the Triangle the integrity would be the

00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,810
key pinnacle of that triangle and what

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,730
you're most concerned about and then

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,230
confidentiality would be the least and

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,880
availability would be the middle of the

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,980
ones that you're concerned about

00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,660
but as Dennis Hughes writes here you

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,520
know there's old adages about the fact

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,620
that the only secure computer is one

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,810
that's you know basically unplugged has

00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,630
no wires encased in concrete you know

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:47,210
and steel and buried underground etc

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:49,490
very funny etc but the point is when you

00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,260
do that you've got zero availability so

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,780
there's always a balance between

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,830
security and availability and keeping

00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,130
the integrity and the confidentiality

00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:01,460
and walking that balance is how you do

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,170
it as a secure programmer all right next

00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,650
thing couple of tones that are still

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:08,210
left handling passwords so very happy

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,820
that over the last few years we've seen

00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:13,340
a lot happen with password complexity

00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,110
stuff if you're not aware of it NIST

00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,820
which is a US National Institute of

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,560
Standards and technology's which

00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,510
publishes the digital identity

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,670
guidelines has made two major changes

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:25,820
over the last I guess it was two summers

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,850
ago now one of them is that basically

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,810
they said they recommend against

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,880
complexity so those are things like for

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,440
example if you're required to use you

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,090
know eight characters and one has to be

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,970
uppercase and a special character in a

00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,980
digit etc what they basically said is by

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,960
requiring these special things that you

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,670
get less benefit than you might expect

00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,650
studies show that basically people

00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,660
started using very very formulaic

00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:50,030
passwords and adding some special

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,330
characters to it so unfortunately it

00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:55,100
didn't make the passwords more secure

00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:57,500
similarly one of the big researchers

00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,090
that came down was from Microsoft having

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,580
passwords reset you know every

00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,590
periodically every 30 days did not

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,000
improve security either so don't require

00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,950
that if you have a reason to believe

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,570
that passwords have been compromised

00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,300
totally different change all the

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,640
passwords but beyond that using any type

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,580
of patch alert complexity and using

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,640
password requirements to change them not

00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:22,310
good instead what you should use is you

00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,930
should use long passwords in fact what

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:27,050
we call them as we call them password

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,970
there's a wonderful comic out by xkcd I

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,680
can't believe I don't have it in the

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,260
slide I don't know why I forgot that but

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,480
it's the xkcd password generator is a

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,640
website you can go to and additionally

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:42,800
there's a pro module or it's actually

00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:45,649
called HS XK password and that module

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,290
will give you pass phrases and so in the

00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:50,660
example on xkcd they use four words I

00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,779
think it's like battery horse staple

00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:56,870
orange and the key point is four words

00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:58,790
very easy to remember very complex much

00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,470
much much more complex than the

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,089
passwords that were used to with

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,890
uppercase and lowercase what we would

00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,870
call a leap tech with technology I

00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,029
usually recommend things like for

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,670
example my wedding anniversary is

00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:12,529
January 1 2020 serves a couple of

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,120
purposes first of all it's very very

00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:16,730
complex so it meets the passphrase

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,130
requirement additionally it's very easy

00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,930
to remember for you and third it makes

00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:25,010
it very very easy for you to remember

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:27,050
your anniversary so the final thing I'll

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,240
leave you with is hashing and salting if

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,040
you're storing passwords and you're not

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,320
hashing them you've got a problem

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,370
hashing is just a simple one-way

00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,560
cryptographic hash such as sha-256

00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:42,020
salting is where you add something to

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,150
that password before you hash it what

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,209
the salting does is it makes it so that

00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:49,730
you cannot be you cannot have brute

00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:52,070
force or rainbow tables done against

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:53,779
your information so very very important

00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:56,150
and if you're not familiar with it I

00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:58,550
recommend highly that you go look at the

00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:02,630
website have I been pwned calm that's

00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:04,100
have I been and then pwn Iggy comm great

00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,600
website you can plug in your email

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,300
address or if you're a domain owner you

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,130
can plug in your domain you can see how

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,900
many times your email address or your

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,000
domains email addresses have been

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,770
compromised in compromises out there on

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,360
the Internet and this is why we do

00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,740
things like try and tell people to use

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,930
unique passwords and things like that

00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:24,130
because they'll compromise somebody else

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:26,630
and then use those passwords there so a

00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,850
little bit more and I'm almost done for

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,790
this and we'll get into my Dirty Dozen

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,800
part but please support multi-factor

00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,240
authentication that's typically where

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,800
there's something you have and something

00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,170
you know a passphrase and

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,800
an app in the Google Authenticator is

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:46,440
free to use as an app on many mobile

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,080
platforms and there's a simple module to

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,029
use it off Google off

00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,160
additionally password reset capabilities

00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:54,779
we talked about password resets when you

00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,360
get compromised but those become a key

00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,740
attack people go through mailboxes when

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,839
they compromised them they look for

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,990
resets they try and build a matrix of

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,130
data so reset emails should only be

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,399
allowed to last for a very short

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:11,850
lifetime 24 hours or even less other

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,950
than that the key point is when you do a

00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,570
reset send the user an email tell them

00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,490
hey your passwords been updated thanks

00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,019
that's that can let them know if there's

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,430
something nefarious going on and

00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:22,890
somebody else is trying to compromise

00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:25,560
their account alright

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,920
so Dave do we have any questions before

00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,370
I go to the next section

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,709
nobody's raised their hand all right

00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,320
well normally when I'm at conferences I

00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:39,120
pride myself on actually there was

00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,529
somebody who had actually any question

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,610
he was asking a chat but I think it's

00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:47,640
worth surfacing to you please with a

00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:50,970
small set of dictionary words wouldn't

00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:54,050
that be too easy to brute-force and his

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,730
example set was maybe ten thousand words

00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,490
unfortunately I don't have the data on

00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:03,270
it but my understanding is anecdotally

00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:07,560
know that it is extremely complex and in

00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:11,100
fact I'll see if I can't bring up the XK

00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,350
see the passphrase it was actually

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,310
linked oh the comment was linked in chat

00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:19,110
yes so there's actually a on this

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,550
website this is what kind of got me

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,010
started on it they actually wrote this

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:25,380
article about this this is several years

00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:27,600
old but you know the bits of entropy if

00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,089
you look just with it was correct horse

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,420
battery staple you know was 44 bits of

00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:35,550
entropy as opposed to troubadour

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:38,070
ampersand 3 only had 28 bits of entropy

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:40,440
so basically the entropy is very very

00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,730
high at the time period this was done it

00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,620
was the equivalent of three days of

00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:46,649
computer time versus five hundred fifty

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,360
years of computing time so even for

00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:50,910
basic words as I understand that the

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,550
entropy is still astronomically better

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:56,140
than what

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:57,940
traditionally using passwords alright

00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,680
alright well I have a question and

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,060
normally when I'm face-to-face this is

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,730
when I give out a book or something like

00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,920
that that I've brought as a gift so who

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:11,200
can tell me the name of the first

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,670
all-electronic computer anybody mark

00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:17,260
Gardner raised his hand so I think we

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:18,610
got to unmute him he was first he niak

00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,710
it was ENIAC

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,000
so this is normally though when I would

00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,530
tell you you can't have the book unless

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,750
you can tell me what any Act stands for

00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:28,930
so it's electronic numerical integrator

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,580
and computer so the neat part about that

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:33,220
and the reason I brought that up is my

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,530
quiz for this conference the term bug

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,720
actually comes from ENIAC and similar

00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,850
computers where they used vacuum tubes

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,790
and each vacuum tube was the equivalent

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,550
of today's transistor so a single on or

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:48,100
off and one of the vacuum tubes got a

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,780
physical bug in it like a fly and that

00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,970
is actually what broke the system from

00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,040
working so the term that we use today

00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,650
bug fixing and whatnot actually goes

00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,570
back to ENIAC and similar vacuum tube

00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:01,960
based computers where they actually had

00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:04,750
a bug inside the actual vacuum tube all

00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,600
right so that was the tone setters now

00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:11,650
we're gonna go into my 12 Dirty Dozen

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:14,830
rules to basically do secure program so

00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:16,690
the first one I thought about a lot I I

00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,400
don't know that I like the order of this

00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:21,400
there's so many of them that I wanted to

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,740
put first but what I basically started

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,320
with here is use a software development

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,960
life cycle and that's DLC very simply

00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,690
start with things like gathering your

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,220
requirements for the program think about

00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,140
building in the security what we call

00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,210
baked in not bolted on so security

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,160
should be first this is something you

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,750
should think about from day one one of

00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,570
the biggest problems that I get when I'm

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,700
doing remediations is people do things

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:48,340
they set up a you know database

00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,840
structure or they originally start doing

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,210
the programming with elevated privileges

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,680
and a couple of years goes by and

00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:56,020
everybody forgets that that's the case

00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,480
and the next thing we know is there's a

00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,520
compromise we go back in and go hey why

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,170
is this database like this or hey why

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,060
are you doing this and they go oh yeah

00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,430
we started doing that and we forgot to

00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,470
fix it so

00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:11,770
the next thing that we do is we do a lot

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:14,740
of agile techniques so we use a scrum

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:16,810
and in the scrums we do a think evil

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,640
section where we basically say okay how

00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:20,980
can you hack this system what is what is

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,840
wrong with this design if you guys

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,580
aren't familiar with scrum or agile

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,680
there's a wonderful youtube link for

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,750
scrum in two minutes I recommend every

00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,480
team look at it it's a great way to

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,280
really revise what you're doing and even

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,600
if you're not gonna use full agile and

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,610
you're not gonna use sprints and things

00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,990
like that one of the things we do at our

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,720
firm and we do this for things not even

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,580
just involving programming is we have

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,050
scrum stand-ups every single day and

00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,000
during that we have three questions

00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,950
they're asked you know what did you do

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,320
yesterday what are you doing today and

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,760
what are your blockers and then if we're

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,260
doing a software we all talk about the

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,290
thinkI more like how can this be hacked

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,950
so with that you want to use test-driven

00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,900
development

00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,300
ideally writing tests before you even

00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,610
start writing codes so that you know is

00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,100
it secure when it's done and then

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,870
finally use pen testing and pen testing

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,090
validation concepts and bug bounty

00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,860
programs I talk a lot about changing the

00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,300
culture and companies and that's what I

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,360
talk about you know bug bounties

00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:19,120
acknowledging out bugs for example if I

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,380
go to a company and in the national

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,150
vulnerabilities database they have

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,280
things called CBE's or vulnerabilities

00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,780
that are tracked if I see a program or a

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,180
software that's in there with zero of

00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,680
them I don't think that's good I usually

00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,000
mean that that's their hiding they're

00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,430
not telling what's going on they're not

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,320
ethically disclosing the bugs in their

00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,810
software so you know think about

00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,850
changing those cultures the USAF

00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:42,100
fast-track puts you guys Air Force is a

00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,050
concept instead of using risk modeling

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,730
what they do is they pen test the

00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,070
software and then use that penetration

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,660
test as the baseline a kind of an

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,820
interesting way to do faster based

00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,550
learning so something to think about

00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,180
all right number two problems input

00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:58,120
validation

00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:00,010
luckily Perl is wonderful for this so

00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,170
the key thing with input validation is

00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,730
you never trust user data you have to in

00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:06,310
Val you have to validate it all the time

00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:08,560
so for example I'll go to the number two

00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,150
first learn your regular expressions

00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,880
regular expressions are just

00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:15,430
unbelievably powerful the talk that was

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,820
I guess two before mine on ingesting you

00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:21,039
know terabytes of data unstructured or

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,440
we structured data talked about using a

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,330
thousand plus line regular expression I

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,370
can't even imagine writing one that long

00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,380
but this particular one here is very

00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:31,269
simple it just searches for everything

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,700
that is not zero through nine and

00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:36,100
replaces it with nothing so it's a great

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,840
way of sanitizing something and saying

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,090
it's a number very simplistic but you

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,950
can build on this type of stuff so we

00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,330
have similar things for doing email

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,779
addresses we'll talk a little bit about

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,750
that

00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:48,549
etc additionally one of the things that

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:52,149
I get a lot at home Swift security is

00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:54,549
that people do lots of UX design on

00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:56,980
their websites and they check to see if

00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:58,419
the input for example is a number but

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,029
what they forget to do is they forget to

00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:02,470
do it again on the server-side so what I

00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:04,659
usually try and tell people from a

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,509
security standpoint is all of your

00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:09,610
validation inputs must be done on the

00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:12,009
server if you also do them on the

00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:14,559
client-side that is just to improve

00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:15,759
their user experience that's it so you

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,409
know if you have something that checks

00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,120
to see if it's a good email address and

00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:21,610
you do that in the browser that's just

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,559
to save them extra steps but you still

00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:26,440
need to do the check on the server as

00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:29,080
well and then finally you know if you

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,309
take data from a user try and sanitize

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,440
it try and get it to the point where

00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:34,269
it's trusted so that you don't have to

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,610
keep doing it and it doesn't creep in

00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:38,230
later on in any dynamic functionality

00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,559
what I mean by that is say for example

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,870
you have a field that asks for the you

00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:44,950
have the person's name well validate the

00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,960
name that it doesn't have anything

00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,610
sinister in it store it in a different

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,009
hash for example and then you can use

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,179
the sanitized hash throughout the rest

00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:54,100
of the site and then you don't have to

00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:55,929
remember that oh I've already sanitized

00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,509
it in this in this function or is this

00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:00,610
before it got sanitized etc you know it

00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:03,129
is already done kind of the simpler

00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:06,220
similar to the bless' functionality as

00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:08,279
well all right commercial break I will

00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,990
mention libraries for input validation

00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:13,149
one that I'm very proud of is net valid

00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,490
MX I'm the key author for that it's up

00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:18,340
on Sipan we recently released version

00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,940
2.5 oh this has been used for a long

00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,470
time

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,019
decades at this point I think decades

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,929
plus it's tested literally trillions of

00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:27,669
email addresses it's used on a lot of

00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:30,190
servers to test whether or not you can

00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:31,840
email that server and it does a little

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,800
bit more than just your regular

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,470
expression of the

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,020
the valid email address it looks for the

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,850
concept of is this a valid email address

00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,250
and also can this person receive email

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,990
and between those two of it it can tell

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,880
you if they've got a valid mail exchange

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,430
your MX record so something look at

00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,840
that's one of my modules it's very

00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,340
useful for that kind of stuff but

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,870
there's a lot of modules out there for

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,820
doing validation so definitely take a

00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,620
look into them all right number three

00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,390
and this is the one that I'm most

00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,800
heavily debated putting number one this

00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,920
is probably the number one issue that I

00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:06,460
see in incident responses is SQL

00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:08,320
placeholders or lack thereof so SQL but

00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,720
placeholders also are known as buying

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,370
values and those parameter markers but

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,640
basically it's the difference between

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:17,650
having a query such as what I've got

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,150
number one or you know select star from

00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:25,060
this or user ID equals ID if ID contain

00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,800
malicious data such as the little bobby

00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,290
tables which will stay in the next

00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,600
screen you have a problem very very

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:35,380
simple fix that has existed I don't know

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,080
20 25 years at least is you use what I

00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,490
called SQL placeholders and so in this

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,890
particular case you know where user ID

00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:44,290
equals question mark and then basically

00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,880
your database queries are automatically

00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:49,990
sanitized and you don't have to ever

00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:53,650
worry about SQL getting injected and you

00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:55,530
know as the xkcd somewhat humorously

00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:59,050
unless you've been hacked recently shows

00:23:55,530 --> 00:24:01,360
you know SQL injections are really quite

00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,010
easy to do on many websites if I'm doing

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,660
a penetration tester I'm doing something

00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:06,670
where it's where I'm looking for it

00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:09,310
I will literally type in things like in

00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:11,110
a name I'll type a single tick mark and

00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:12,670
I'll look for an error and the error

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,980
will come back something like you know

00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,750
unbalanced you know tick marks or

00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,390
something like that that type of error

00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:22,240
tells me they've got they're putting

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,740
trying to put data in unsanitized this

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,510
is a big problem we find it all the time

00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,340
with people like we go into the trouble

00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,170
reports and somebody was trying to do

00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,360
something like register you know Bobby

00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,860
Oshana he and they can't do it because

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,050
of the apostrophe and we go okay that's

00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:38,110
because your SQL injectable on your name

00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:41,620
and you have a bug in you know how

00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:45,220
you're sanitizing that so don't don't be

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,690
that person use use SQL placeholders and

00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,360
we have a question

00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:58,960
from camera and pots can we go ahead and

00:24:49,360 --> 00:25:00,010
unmute him Dave yeah sorry I couldn't

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,140
find out where the raised hand button

00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:05,140
was but going back a little bit talking

00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:09,400
about validating input training the

00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:13,030
other day about pearls tank checking

00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:15,700
mode would you recommend using that how

00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:19,210
to use that before I have and it's

00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:21,040
excellent I just don't know how I would

00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,800
bring it into play on an entire

00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,600
ecosystem of web and data that I'm

00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,220
getting for other sources I mean pearl

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,290
strength of course is it's a glue

00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,140
language that can take output from all

00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:34,090
these other places so unfortunately most

00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,280
of the time I'm using records that are

00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:38,770
stored in hashes and I create a blessed

00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:43,930
hash basically and then I know that data

00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:45,400
is validated okay thank you and I think

00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:50,550
we have two more people go ahead and

00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,550
just I can't tell names unfortunately so

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:56,410
all right I'll jump in there um so you

00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:00,510
talked about sanitizing data do you

00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:02,650
prefer sanitizing over just rejecting

00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,840
yeah because you know the vast majority

00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:07,150
of the time you know if you kind of look

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,910
at eBay has a wonderful phrase that I

00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,410
like which is basically that 99.9

00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,670
percent of the people are just trying to

00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,470
get stuff done and they're basically

00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,550
decent people

00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,410
unfortunately there's that point one or

00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:19,630
point zero zero one percent of people

00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,520
that are bad actors that are ruining it

00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,870
for everybody else you know as the idiom

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,840
goes you know this is why we can't have

00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,820
nice things so the reality is that most

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,430
of the time it's user error and so

00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:32,620
anytime I can do something that

00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:34,690
sanitizes the data to fix it for the

00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,580
user the better a really really common

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:39,880
thing that you'll find in net valid MX

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,470
for example is if you put trailing or

00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,660
leading whitespace on an email address

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,650
it will pass you back the email address

00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,050
without the leading and trailing

00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:48,430
whitespace just because people always

00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,200
enter that wrong

00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:52,780
another thing that we do that's really

00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,090
minor is if somebody's types like you

00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,460
know Bob at AOL it'll automatically add

00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:59,740
com for them or Gmail it'll do the same

00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,610
thing and those type of little tiny

00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,500
fixes

00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:07,210
are just meant to try and help the user

00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:09,070
so yeah if it possible I will try and

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:12,100
sanitize the data and move forward as

00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:16,210
opposed to throwing an error

00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:19,059
Darren might see your hand raised yes

00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:23,350
just following that I can tell you can

00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:26,230
hear me right yes sir so I agree with

00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:29,559
what you said about sanitizing in a lot

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:32,040
of cases however I would tend to lean a

00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:35,500
little further in the direction of

00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,929
rejecting because depending on the case

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,299
sometimes the solution for sanitizing

00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:42,809
may actually break something like for

00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:46,870
example automatically adding the dot-com

00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:48,669
if that was just done generically if

00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,679
that was just done generically well what

00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:52,570
if the actual domain was a dotnet or

00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,600
something then suddenly you registered

00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:57,160
it to the wrong thing so well really do

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,440
it in very specific cases like literally

00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,960
AOL you know it's one of the ones people

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,850
would in inherently forget to type to

00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,410
calm when they would do add a well for

00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,720
example and a lot of that had to do with

00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:10,929
the fact of when AOL was launched in

00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,240
their internal mail systems right so

00:28:10,929 --> 00:28:15,820
that's good just always airing on the if

00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,250
in doubt always error and rather than

00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:20,650
change it you know do what I do except

00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:24,910
when it's wrong and then don't so thank

00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:26,620
you - all right so after that here's one

00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:28,870
of the biggest problems we get and you

00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,150
know especially with the I don't know

00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:34,059
what I've got on my screen there I think

00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:35,620
I was starting to put something somebody

00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:38,049
was doing a white board I don't know

00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,330
any case the key thing here is that

00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,460
errors are too informative what this

00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:44,919
means is you have to be very careful

00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:47,440
what you show that an end-user can see

00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:48,880
or perhaps a bad actor you know error

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,429
message that say things like for example

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,559
error can't write - bla bla bla file

00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:55,000
name could tell me a lot about your file

00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,549
system could tell me what what what

00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,679
operating system you're running could

00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:00,400
potentially lead to disclosure of

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,010
sensitive data

00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,020
so in general we do things like you know

00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:07,330
we try and give errors that are fairly

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,850
generic with a timestamp and then

00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:11,950
basically with that the tracking number

00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:14,140
we can then go to the logs which kind of

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:18,070
leads into what I call log

00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:20,530
log so number five my big thing here is

00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,700
improve your logging in general you want

00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,230
to make sure that you're logging does

00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,330
not include passwords or sensitive

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,880
material the only times that we do

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:30,430
passwords is we do it with bad actors

00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,650
when we're doing sacrificial lambs which

00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:34,690
are boxes that we put out there to kind

00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:36,520
of get people to attack them so we can

00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,510
see what they're doing but short of that

00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,930
you want to make sure that your

00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:41,920
sensitive data is not in your logs

00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:44,530
additionally you want to restrict your

00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,900
log access and you want to make sure

00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:48,520
that you log those validation errors so

00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,530
as Darin was pointing out sometimes they

00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,500
can be problems and they can also show

00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:55,600
signs where attackers are attacking

00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,210
looking for weaknesses in your system so

00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,730
a lot of people ask me sometimes how

00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:03,040
I've discovered so many zero-days and

00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:04,420
whatnot in the Valle Nevado zero-day is

00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,390
a vulnerability as it's not known

00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,860
publicly yet and you know I've had the

00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:10,990
privilege of turning in some zero-days

00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:13,870
some pretty long pretty large companies

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:15,400
and you know the funny part is a lot of

00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:18,010
times I'm not the one discovering them I

00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,600
just set up systems that I look at what

00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,850
bad actors are doing and when I see them

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,170
doing something new I try and get them

00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:26,290
to show me what technique they're gonna

00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:28,420
do so in any case the last thing I'll

00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:31,150
say is look at consolidating your logs

00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:33,100
you can do things like syslog all - a

00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:36,880
combined system you can go to something

00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,860
more complex called a sim SIEM but the

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,350
es island you can also look at things

00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:44,740
like elastic search or an elastic an elk

00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:46,270
stack all open-source great way to store

00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,670
your data and then surface it and

00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:52,210
visualize it with elasticsearch log

00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:55,780
stash and Cabana is the elk stack

00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:58,840
additionally autonomous autonomous

00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:01,540
blocks so what this means is you know

00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,310
sword just autonomous response the big

00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,710
thing that you have nowadays is there's

00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:07,270
so many systems getting attacked in fact

00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,980
if you just put a machine up on the

00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:10,480
internet within a few minutes you will

00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,160
generally see attacks start on the

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,680
system they're literally just attacking

00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,630
every IP address out there

00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,610
ipv6 fixes this a little but I b-before

00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:20,440
definitely it's a problem there's easy

00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,810
easy tools out there like fail to ban

00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,970
that can easily automate blocks from

00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:27,520
your logs there's a lot of recipes out

00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,210
there and they can look for things like

00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,950
for

00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:32,560
if you're using WordPress as your main

00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:34,840
CMS for a website it can monitor that

00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,690
and look for brute force locking logins

00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,520
and then block that IP address but you

00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,900
know the nice thing with fail to ban is

00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,190
it will release the ban after a certain

00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,800
amount of time you can configure it that

00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,810
way but you know administrators can be

00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,430
brute forced out of the system or do s

00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:50,200
out of the system by using these type of

00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:52,360
techniques so you have to think evil

00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,910
think about how people will use your own

00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,200
systems against you and the way we

00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,940
normally talk about that is consider

00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,420
rate limiting and blocks per IP address

00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:03,070
for example all right number seven

00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,270
so we alluded a little bit to this one

00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,640
we were talked about one of the problems

00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:08,830
we get where people start with a program

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,320
and we come in and ask them why did they

00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:13,120
do this and the thing is it's it's

00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,530
principles of least privilege this

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,510
basically means when you start

00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,460
developing your code please start

00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:22,780
developing it with the principles less

00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:25,150
least privileged in my things I've seen

00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,470
and things I've made is you know I get

00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:29,140
on a box and the first thing I do is I

00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:32,140
turn off SELinux or I used to just do

00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:34,780
grant all on databases to users or I

00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,790
would use a root level access a thing

00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,740
for general work or for backups or

00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,540
something like that don't do this these

00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,610
are things that lead to in the long term

00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,440
two problems spend the time figure out

00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,030
how to do I see Linux figure out how to

00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,770
give only the privileges that are needed

00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:50,080
for a database for example you're

00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:52,270
running a website how often does a

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,380
website need the ability to drop a

00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:58,390
database or drop a table probably never

00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:01,810
so don't give those privileges to it and

00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:04,660
you would not be susceptible to the

00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:06,160
little Bobbie tables SQL injection that

00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,660
we talked about earlier because your

00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,520
your database wouldn't even have the

00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,260
rights the user excuse me accessing the

00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,700
database from your website wouldn't even

00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,280
have the ability to drop a table or a

00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,630
database so other than that I'll just

00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,880
say you know when you're using elevated

00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,800
privileges or sudo use it for a shorter

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,400
window as possible and don't use it for

00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:26,380
programming nowadays I've run all my all

00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:30,280
my releases for spamassassin

00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:31,960
I now run with a non privileged accounts

00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,860
so I can make sure that they the

00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:38,290
releases work without that next thing

00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:41,170
number eight of 12 are we doing on time

00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:42,130
we're doing okay target so this one is

00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,170
pretty simple it's basically

00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:46,330
just have an incident plan you know when

00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:48,310
you have a problem speed matters so

00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:49,690
normally if I'm going through incident

00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:51,640
plans some of the ones that really make

00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:56,400
sense to people are you know pretty

00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:59,620
simple CEO leaves a cell phone in a cab

00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,720
whose carrier do you have remote

00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:04,660
capabilities to wipe it does he have

00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,360
encryption on it things like that what's

00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,040
the phone number to to to call this or

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,230
what software do you have installed on

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,629
it where the credentials stored things

00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:16,510
like that can help you react very

00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:18,100
quickly and oftentimes it's not a funny

00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,620
joke but I usually tell people don't

00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,210
panic even if you don't have an incident

00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,620
plan for a specific thing even if you

00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:25,659
pull a piece of paper out and the paper

00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,440
says you know you don't have a plan but

00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:28,480
don't panic

00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,340
that can actually help because then

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,500
people will go okay we don't have a plan

00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,300
let's go powwow and find out what our

00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,240
response is gonna be and spend five

00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,560
minutes calmly thinking about what our

00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,840
triage is gonna be and how we're gonna

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,460
attack this problem and as you go

00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,090
through these type of problems write

00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,710
them down

00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:47,290
keep them at hand you know what do you

00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,659
do if passwords been compromised what do

00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:51,040
you do if somebody your account has been

00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:53,020
compromised what do you do in specific

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,580
situations that will occur you know do

00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,200
you have to notify authorities do you

00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,660
have to notify customers do you have to

00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,850
notify insurance companies things like

00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,410
that some people don't realize it but a

00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,910
lot of cyber security insurance if you

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,840
don't notify them within a certain

00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:07,660
period of time

00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:11,470
they are not they do not have to cover

00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:14,080
you for that outage or that incident so

00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:16,120
very important to have these next thing

00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,610
this one is something I talk about a lot

00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:20,500
especially with new people but this one

00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:23,110
I'm very happy to talk about a lot is

00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,060
have a moral compass one of the ones

00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:26,770
that I love I call this the IT Ten

00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,800
Commandments is the system

00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:32,050
administrators guild or now you snicks

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,180
code of ethics it's a very very good

00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,950
framework and let's see if I can load it

00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,080
up you know this is the type of

00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:40,750
framework that any IT person can get

00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,490
behind it's very very simple you know I

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:44,230
will maintain Professional Conduct I

00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:47,050
will be honest in my professional

00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:48,760
dealings etc if you have a problem at

00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:50,800
your work or somebody's asking you to do

00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,570
something you can go read through these

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,940
ethics guidelines and there's only about

00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:56,800
11 of them many years old

00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:59,050
you know almost twenty years old now and

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,490
I can tell you I haven't found many

00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:03,280
loopholes in it and I haven't found

00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:05,500
where it is service wrong so a moral

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,190
compass can really help you especially

00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,200
when you're unsure what to do and I have

00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:13,890
no idea why I'm going all the way back

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,680
there but let's see if we get this or to

00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:18,790
fast forward a little bit additionally

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,200
if you're looking for something a little

00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:22,450
more advanced

00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:25,089
there's the qualified ethical hacker or

00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:27,190
the certified ethical hacker I usually

00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:29,980
won't talk about specific offensive

00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:32,260
cyber techniques until I know everybody

00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:35,200
in the audience has a qhs and eh

00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:36,310
certification because I as I mentioned I

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,410
don't want to be the person you have to

00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:40,000
call to say hey the FBI is at my door

00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:42,310
because I did something stupid and I

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,140
need help so follow the essence

00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:46,089
guideline think about more

00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,560
certifications all right use a moral

00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:49,750
compass with this stuff it'll help you

00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,980
and things like ethical disclosure it'll

00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,450
help you if people ask you to do

00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,849
something and you're not sure it's right

00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,109
or wrong you can think about it and I'm

00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:58,270
always available with my linkedin

00:36:56,109 --> 00:37:00,250
confident credentials are there but talk

00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,599
to your community you know say you know

00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,829
hey somebody's asked me to do this what

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,089
do you think of that

00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:06,609
you know this stuff isn't written in

00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:08,020
stone and you know the open source

00:37:06,609 --> 00:37:09,940
software and Perl and things like that

00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,280
have changed the way computing works in

00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,260
the last 20 plus years so this stuff is

00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,680
evolving constantly so you need a moral

00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,300
compass

00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:20,170
to help point you in the right direction

00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,069
with new things all right number 10 we

00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,510
talked a little bit about the

00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:24,880
vulnerabilities database the national

00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:27,010
vulnerabilities database the biggest

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,010
problem that we see is not tracking CDEs

00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:31,060
so in particular not to call this one

00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,829
out badly

00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:35,890
in fact I'm trying to give a compliment

00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:40,900
to cPanel there was a issue identified

00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:42,970
with XM very bad one it was the plus or

00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,619
a dollar sign squiggly brace one and you

00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,960
can run any command by sending an email

00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:50,500
to somebody so you can email route plus

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,630
dollar signs Quigley brace and some

00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:55,960
commands and it would run those commands

00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:57,430
as the user you were emailing it to XM

00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,140
never meant for that to be in a public

00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:01,930
release they just messed up and didn't

00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:04,030
take it out long story short is it was

00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:06,099
fixed very very quickly cPanel put out

00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,310
urgent updates for it and the reason I'm

00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:10,410
showing this particular one is that

00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:13,350
even though this was last summer when

00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:15,810
this was out there just a few weeks ago

00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:18,030
the NSA had to put out a warning that

00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:22,200
this is being exploited by the Russians

00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:23,610
quite heavily with XM so for those who

00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,010
are at this meeting if you're not using

00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:28,530
X if you're using XM you're not aware of

00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,930
this go make sure you're patched but

00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,670
additionally the key thing is as a

00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:35,210
secure program or if you're looking to

00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,710
be a higher level security programmer

00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,780
think about monitoring things like the

00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:42,510
national vulnerability database you can

00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,920
look out for libraries you might be

00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,780
using programs you might be using in

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,760
your solutions and making sure that

00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,700
they're patched so that doesn't become a

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,550
big giant garage sized or whole and this

00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:55,830
one's huge I mean this is the absolute

00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:58,770
worst of them because it's arbitrary

00:38:55,830 --> 00:39:00,720
remote code F with execution at elevated

00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:04,970
privileges so you can run a command as

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,320
route from remote very very quickly

00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:08,670
okay this one is also one that I

00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,040
considered putting number one this is

00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,140
the number one issue that I think exists

00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,940
today when I come into programmers so

00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,650
what I normally do to find out if you

00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,420
have a problem is how what is your

00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:20,910
process for going from development to

00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,190
Quality Assurance to production and the

00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:24,360
example I give is you know I'll pick on

00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:27,150
Darin since he asked a good question

00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,970
earlier you know I go Darin here is a

00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:31,800
bug in your code here is the fix yes

00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:33,900
thank you for the way here is a bug fix

00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,090
for it it's a one-line bug fix or a

00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,800
one-character bug fix and then I asked

00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,840
how long will it take you to put that

00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,360
into production and I unfortunately

00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:45,000
sometimes get answers that are months

00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,280
for that type of answer it should never

00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,990
be months hopefully people tell me oh

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,030
I've got an automated process for that

00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,590
we can push that into production and we

00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:54,600
can have an emergency release out in a

00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:57,060
few minutes that is what I want to hear

00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,550
a few hours is okay a few days is okay

00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,980
but months is completely unacceptable

00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:03,300
and sometimes the companies don't even

00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,190
have any abilities so they're afraid of

00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,450
breaking everything because they don't

00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,410
have any ability to get anything from

00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:10,200
develop into production

00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:12,920
and this can really stall both

00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,210
development as well as security issues

00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:19,020
so thank you for being a good sport

00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:21,300
there they're the last of my Dirty Dozen

00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,710
is really to kind of avoid stupid

00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,690
mistakes

00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,400
the first way I do that is pair

00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:29,220
programming pair programming comes from

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,900
extreme programming which was a subset

00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,970
of agile a kind of predated agile

00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,440
actually but basically it's where two

00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,790
people look at it one person drives the

00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,280
keyboard another person looks at the

00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:41,280
screen these days we use a lot of things

00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,140
like Google's hangout meats and zoom and

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,130
things like that so people one person is

00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,950
looking at the screen while another

00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:49,560
person types it is wonderful it lowers

00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,880
your QA it fix these bugs to start with

00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,650
thank you

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,170
additionally it kind of gives you a peer

00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,970
review right off the bat the next thing

00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:59,070
we do is code that isn't pair program

00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:00,510
always we use peer reviews somebody else

00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:03,450
looks at the code before it's committed

00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:05,640
that really really helps identify

00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:08,490
security problems and bugs and just what

00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,260
I call stupid mistakes so one person

00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,820
writes that another person commits or

00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,940
accepts the pull requests for example

00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:18,480
and then finally I'll give a little plug

00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,370
this is on my speech before but I was

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,260
asked to do a lightning talk on talk to

00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:24,210
the duck so I'll be doing that tonight

00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,970
but talk to the duck is basically a

00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:28,500
great technique for learning and walking

00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:31,230
through problems when looking for bugs

00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:35,060
and figuring it out so if you aren't

00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:38,130
aware of the talk to the duck concept

00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:40,100
please attend my lightning talk tonight

00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:42,390
I think they start at 5:30 p.m. Eastern

00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,190
and I think I'll be towards the end

00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:45,600
because I use a lot of humor in my talk

00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:49,140
so we'll add it towards the end of the

00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:51,450
of the night for homework again on the

00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:54,150
humor side is to watch the IT crowd on

00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:55,650
Netflix this is probably the single best

00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,540
show out there that bridges the gap

00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:01,200
between technical and non-technical

00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:03,120
people and with that said I've got I

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,350
think one or two more slides but are

00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,420
there questions out there

00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:10,950
I think Darren you had a question two

00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,450
people raised questions yeah yeah I

00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:14,640
don't know if you are suggesting

00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:17,400
otherwise but I would argue that even

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,050
when you do pair programmer pair program

00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,000
you still want to have separate code

00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:23,030
reviews from others because those that

00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,440
are pair programming still have their

00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:28,890
sort of their minds along the same track

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,170
and somebody who's more distanced a

00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:34,110
reviewer would have it's still important

00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:35,850
to have that input yeah I certainly

00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:37,260
would say that more is better but

00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,760
you know in the realistic world

00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,890
sometimes you just don't have that kind

00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,750
of staffing to make that happen so what

00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:44,280
we do is whoever drives the keyboard the

00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,440
other person has to do the commit of the

00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,150
pull request and they're the one that's

00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,500
given grief if there's a bug in the code

00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:52,440
or if there's a security issue in the

00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,960
code but yeah I'm all about multiple

00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,360
pairs of eyeballs on code at the Apache

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,370
Software Foundation for example you know

00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,990
we have rules around voting in three

00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:03,600
plus one votes and things like that

00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,640
we go into a review then commit mode

00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:08,010
versus a commit then review CTR versus

00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,780
RTC you can read a lot about that on

00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:11,670
Apache org if you search that or if

00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:15,240
anybody's interested reach out to me

00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:17,010
otherwise link my company we have over a

00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,640
hundred developers so it's easy enough

00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:21,290
to get extra eyes just for that quality

00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:25,130
absolutely yeah

00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:25,130
somebody else was raising their hand

00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:32,580
what are the differences between those

00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:34,410
two ethical hackers certifications why

00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,640
are there two of them so the two of them

00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:37,740
are really listed because their

00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,510
competitors to some extent qualified

00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,890
ethical hacker and as a conflict of

00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:43,680
interest disclosure I am an advisor

00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:45,870
unpaid for security university they're

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,060
the qualified ethical hacking ceh is a

00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:50,430
DoD span standard so you might not be in

00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:52,590
a situation where you can take a CH

00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,960
certification so they're just different

00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:57,720
examples of ethical hacker

00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,300
certifications they're out there so it's

00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:03,780
one or the other not both usually thank

00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:07,020
you absolutely all right

00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,730
so I thought I had more stuff on here I

00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,070
think I must have deleted that slide so

00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:12,870
other than that I will just end on the

00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:14,640
fact that the IT Crowd is hilarious I

00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:16,260
think it's the one of the best shows out

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,740
there so if you haven't seen it make

00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:22,140
sure you watch it and other than that I

00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:23,400
think I finished six minutes early so if

00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,990
there are more questions I'm happy to

00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,570
take them for a few minutes otherwise I

00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:29,580
will hand things over to Dave and see

00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:32,210
you all at the lightning talk later on

00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,210
the set even

00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:38,570
yeah any question on let's raise your

00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:46,089
hand and Chad or you could just unmute

00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:50,359
and ask it that's fine and we go for it

00:44:46,089 --> 00:44:51,980
and hear me yes sir I was wondering you

00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:53,480
talked I came in a little late you're

00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:56,119
talking about passwords and the long

00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:59,869
passwords what do you think about secure

00:44:56,119 --> 00:45:03,380
shell and key encryption sure you know

00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:05,690
public key you mean like DKI is that

00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:07,430
you're talking about I mean like just

00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:12,500
forgetting the password entirely and

00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:15,770
just using that's to say that is Sh

00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,930
yes so you're still going to have a

00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:19,190
passphrase to encrypt your your private

00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:21,530
key so you're still gonna have that

00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:23,000
there additionally I work in realms

00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:25,460
sometimes that are a little bit scary

00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,630
for people but generally we start to

00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:28,430
worry about things like for example

00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:32,089
something you know something you have

00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:35,720
and you know also worrying about things

00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:37,160
like torture and being able to have

00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,349
passwords out there and things like that

00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,710
so we actually use systems that for

00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:44,300
example we have pins where the the pin

00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:46,430
will let people in the system but it's

00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,619
an alert pin so you have a pin that

00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:50,630
works and you have a pin that that works

00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:52,880
as well but also alerts security that

00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:55,069
you've been compromised things like that

00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,800
so you know there's still a place for

00:45:55,069 --> 00:46:01,130
multi-factor authentication passphrases

00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:03,260
are important towards that type of thing

00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:05,869
and you know like you said something

00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,460
like a pin on a phone as well as a

00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:09,890
passphrase as well as having a private

00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:11,690
key I think is really the better model

00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:14,660
to go and I will tell you that even

00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:16,310
though I know of cases that exist such

00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,710
as things like sim Jack's and things

00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:20,990
like that I have yet in my career to

00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:23,060
work on a situation where a multi-factor

00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:25,760
system was what led to the compromise

00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:28,430
they happen especially in some very very

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,950
very very targeted attacks but I will

00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:32,329
tell you that the average person

00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:34,880
multi-factor authentication will get rid

00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:40,369
of 99.9 and a whole bunch more nines of

00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:41,930
your attack surface for attacks by the

00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:44,210
way my LinkedIn is here I'll take more

00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:45,530
questions but I do welcome people just

00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,329
tell me you know hey you were at this

00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:47,930
meeting and you know I'd love to talk to

00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:49,820
people on

00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:52,310
social media especially linkedin's my

00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:53,750
choice whoever's raised your hand next

00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,820
and fortune I just have to hands raised

00:46:53,750 --> 00:47:00,740
dissolve Christopher White was first

00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:02,930
okay Christopher wrong button there we

00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:05,420
go thanks very much for the talk Kevin

00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:10,130
I'm in the I work in embedded software

00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:13,280
for autonomous devices any advice and

00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:15,050
Linux usually any advice for the

00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,750
embedded sector or any things that yeah

00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:19,490
sure watch how so one of the tools that

00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:21,170
I've been mentoring for a little while

00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:26,440
now that I love is a product called

00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:29,300
Apache IOT DB IOT DB is designed for

00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:32,030
logging very very significant amounts of

00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:34,730
data so for example it can with a single

00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:36,590
server ingest over 500 million data

00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:38,780
points per minute

00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:40,820
I would not to throw any specific

00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:43,460
database under the bus but I would say

00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:46,220
throw you know half a trillion data

00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:48,590
points at a by the way that it's five

00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:52,580
million but we do 500 billion in a day

00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:54,770
for example of logging and throw a half

00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:56,750
a billion a half a trillion rows into a

00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:59,930
database and try and do a query on it

00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:01,700
and it won't work so Apache IOT VB is a

00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:04,070
type of database that is called a time

00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:06,530
series database and so it's designed to

00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:08,510
store timestamp data very very well and

00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:11,000
very very efficiently and do queries

00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:12,890
from it very very efficiently and so

00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,770
when I'm looking at i/o t divided

00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:17,120
devices or embedded devices again

00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:19,730
logging is one of the biggest issues

00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:21,590
that we see so we want to have off-site

00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,360
logging we want to have very very

00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:25,010
lightweight logging and then we want to

00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:28,130
have the ability to do stuff with that

00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:29,270
logging and so if you want I can send

00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,490
you some of those slide decks about

00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:33,380
Apache IOT DB but the whole thing that

00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:36,440
we do there is we're trying to cover the

00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:38,150
entire lifecycle the data so for example

00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,860
we want to log the data logging is

00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:41,990
number one we want to be able to analyze

00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:43,700
the data that's number two and we want

00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:46,430
to be able to perhaps visualize the data

00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:49,520
and we want to be able to store the data

00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:51,230
long-term so a really example that that

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,510
I had that started me with the Apache

00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:55,010
IOT DB is we were dealing with a wind

00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:57,440
farm that had a thing called a derecho

00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:59,420
that attacked it Dre chose not a cyber

00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,160
attack it's a physical Connecticut Astra

00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,740
T which is another part of cyber is

00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,100
protecting

00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:07,170
physical catastrophes and there was

00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:09,690
another derecho that was planned excuse

00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:11,700
me that was forecasted and so with that

00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:13,619
they said what do we need to do and what

00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,110
can we expect from this next trade show

00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:18,869
how's it going to affect our wind

00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:21,360
turbine field and basically I went back

00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:23,520
I talked to Noah and came back to them

00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,920
with some data from the NWS that's

00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,750
Weather Service stuff and I said okay

00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,520
the last similar event that they are

00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:31,260
predicting was February 23rd of this

00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,510
date let's go look at your data for that

00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,160
date and they said we can't we delete

00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:37,350
all our data after 30 days because our

00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:40,050
data we can't store data longer than 30

00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:43,230
days it brings the server down so that's

00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:45,480
a failure of logging Apache IO TDB fixes

00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,490
a lot of that because they can run on

00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,710
the individual like raspberry PI's for

00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:51,180
example you can run around and grab SD

00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:52,590
cards out of your raspberry PI's to

00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:55,680
collect the data you can have a cell

00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:57,540
phone that uploads the data etc and then

00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:01,650
it can ingest it all into a system then

00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:04,140
the Shanghai metro uses it with radio

00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:05,850
antennas that upload the data and things

00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:08,460
like that so it's a way of collecting

00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:10,170
the data and then each of each of the

00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:12,630
servers uses what's called TS files

00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:14,940
which are like zip files for the data

00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:16,980
and so you can just take a zip files out

00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:19,410
and store them and bring them back in as

00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,730
you need them and as I mentioned it can

00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:23,100
deal with you know literally trillions

00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:24,900
of data points and on top of that it

00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:28,230
does a lot of things for out of order

00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:30,540
data and for not locking the database

00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:32,490
when you're doing ingestion of data and

00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,930
then you want to do queries so if you

00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:35,700
have a system where you're constantly

00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:37,260
getting queries and you're doing a half

00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:40,050
a trillion row a half a trillion

00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:41,850
rows in an hour for example you know you

00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:43,770
can't wait for those queries to be

00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:46,020
ingested to get your visualization if

00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:48,810
you're looking at a real-time attack so

00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,950
it has some solutions for that just off

00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:52,980
the hand that would be the number one

00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:57,690
thing that I love also there's a group

00:50:52,980 --> 00:51:01,109
called cs2 AI org that's charlie Samuel

00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:05,160
the numeral 2 as an apple I is an indigo

00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:09,810
org that is pronounced C say and that is

00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:12,690
a cyber something systems group so

00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:14,730
that's basically a ot operational

00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:15,330
technology and that embedded Linux is

00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:18,180
and

00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:20,520
devices for security some great talks

00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:22,830
both at the local levels I think there's

00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:27,390
quite a few hundred chapters now as well

00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:27,960
as the the overall global chapter thanks

00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:30,060
very much

00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:33,390
absolutely all right how we doing on

00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:35,160
time I think we can take one more

00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,840
question if it's quick and we have one

00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,610
hand raised from Patrick all right

00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:43,170
Patrick you are the last person of the

00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:46,170
night thanks Kevin my question is do you

00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:49,200
have any recommendations for static

00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:51,090
application security testing tools yeah

00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,510
so there's there's pretty much three big

00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:53,820
ones

00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:55,740
and unfortunately the reasons for

00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,720
recommending one over the other so you

00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:00,690
have pretty much of error code you have

00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:04,620
white hat security and you have synopsis

00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:06,870
now which owns Black Duck and all of

00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:09,600
them can do static s ast they can do

00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:10,320
dynamic they can do source code analysis

00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,380
SCA

00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:15,330
which can check for libraries but the

00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,310
bad part is they they have different

00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:20,790
models for their pricing in different

00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:22,260
situations and so unfortunately it's

00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:24,810
sometimes it needs a bit of analysis for

00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:27,180
your exact application as to which one

00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:28,650
will be best because the the pricing and

00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:33,000
the differences between the three can be

00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:34,350
pretty varying and whatnot and if you

00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,780
tell me like oh you're trying to deal

00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:37,830
with open source you might find this one

00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,030
over here better if you're you're

00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:40,800
working with one particular language

00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,660
some of them work better and one than

00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,800
the other but the three products that I

00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,530
would be looking at our white hat

00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:48,600
security known as WHS black duck which

00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:52,530
is now on by synopsis and then very code

00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:54,060
BER ACODE and if you email me I'm happy

00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:56,100
to tell you some of the parameters that

00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,780
you might have or you know I'm available

00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:01,250
for consulting and in for shield as well

00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,250
