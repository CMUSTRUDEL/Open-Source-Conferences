Title: Damian Conway - Keynote: A Simple Matter Of Programming

Description: 
	There are already great IDEs for both Perl (Padre) and Raku (Comma).
They're both designed to help you write software faster
...by providing a range of syntax-based coding tools.
More importantly, they can both help you rewrite software better
...by supplying a set of language-aware refactoring mechanisms.

There's only one problem: neither of them is Vim
(or Emacs or «your editor-of-addiction here»).

In this talk I'll introduce a new set of modules, designed to
make it easy to add syntax-driven Perl source refactoring
and other useful code transformations to any modern text editor,
or any other scriptable application.

Along the way, we'll explore the horrors of Perl's scoping rules,
navigate the labyrinth of Perl's many argument passing conventions,
and descend briefly into the whirling maelstrom that is
generalized semiautonomous contextual API inference.

We'll also look ahead to examine how I'm planning to implement
the same set of code manipulation tools for Raku, and see why
that's going to be at least two or three times as challenging
...but also an order of magnitude easier.
