00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,630
Sauckel I'm working at attic and partner

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,000
in a small company in Switzerland who

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,170
some of you might know from the

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,150
aesthetic a squirrel

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:20,270

00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,270
[Music]

00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,470
well there are a lot of good things

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,289
about curl and rock ooh but I think it

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,880
still needs improvements in variants or

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:37,140
its places and I think you can help

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:41,579
improve on and Rocco even if you cannot

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,309
draw from or not well enough or you

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:52,500
don't have time or you have some other

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:54,360
reason or excuse West miss Howe I'll

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,050
tell you a few things we did in the last

00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:02,250
year's we and our customers contributed

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:06,409
by funding Rocco module development for

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:13,020
example to promote rules lock timeline

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:17,450
and initial spreadsheet xlsx module to

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,450
parse and write spreadsheet files

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:28,409
we also made chase in fast faster and we

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:33,020
got a thread safety BiH for SQLite or by

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,020
subcontracting well-known Ruocco experts

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,850
the same projects also gave inspirations

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:44,549
for come iet a features they are the

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,740
biggest project also provided a real

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,470
real testitude for helping more vm

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:54,060
development and we are casual response

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:58,079
ring for examples we spell workshops so

00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,930
what could your contributions feed you

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,409
can for example convince your company to

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,659
regularly donate to the foundation to

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,879
hire some Perl or aqua export

00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:13,060
for whatever for talks for programming

00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,640
for whatever your needs are and you can

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,250
pay them well enough so that we can

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,330
afford to we'll get more on Pearlman

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:24,519
taqwa and in their free time

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:27,849
you and your company can also pay more

00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:32,680
than ten dollars for this conference or

00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:34,330
whatever else you come up with so why

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,980
should you convince your company

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:40,720
directly donate to TPS because it's

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:45,069
almost impossible to do so from the

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,670
outside you know best how important

00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:50,079
useful pearl and aqua for your business

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,660
and regular contributions are less

00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:58,540
effort flammable and TAS more efficient

00:02:52,660 --> 00:03:00,329
for both sides actual yes you can even

00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:06,810
right now

00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:06,810
just go there thanks for listening

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,900
