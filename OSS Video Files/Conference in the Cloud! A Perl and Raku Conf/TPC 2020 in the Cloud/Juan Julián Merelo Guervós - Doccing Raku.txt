Title: Juan Julián Merelo Guervós - Doccing Raku
Publication date: 2020-06-25
Playlist: TPC 2020 in the Cloud
Description: 
	Unlike many (maybe most) free software projects where the same people write the code and the documentation for it, it was a design decision from the beginning that documentation of Raku, its classes and more meta stuff, would be clearly separated from the interpreter (and the rest of the parts of Raku) itself. A documentation repository was created by Moritz Lenz, who started to hammer away at writing down what every piece of Raku did, and how to put together programs and modules that use it. This documentation repository eventually became host to three different things: the source of the documentation itself, written in Pod6, a SLANG within Raku for documentation, but also the command that indexes and shows that documentation, a series of modules that process and extract metadata and source from that documentation to generate a static website.

The management of the site became a do-ocracy, with anyone with a commit bit deciding on where to go next, which issues to address, which PRs to accept, in a model that is actually not so different from the rest of the Raku ecosystem, but which makes sustainable and, over all, long term development, a challenge. In this talk we will first analyze the model of Raku documentation and what kind of lessons can be learned from it for software development at large, and Perl and Raku development in particular. Then we will analyze data on contributions to the Raku documentation repository and see how this software development model has worked out, what it lacks and what can be done to improve it just a tiny bit.

In 2019, everything (kind of) changed. A student, Antonio Gámiz, worked on a new system to parse, index and generate the documentation called Documentable. This was intended as a plug-in replacement for the former doc-site generation script, but it’s eventually something that’s a bit more than that. It creates a stack of modules that are not monolithic, have many endpoints for use, and can become a new ecosystem for document processing. This is still very much a work in progress, but it’s reduced by 75% the time needed to generate the whole documentation, and almost by 90% the time needed to regenerate it.

This talk is, at the same time, an presentation of the documentation as an entryway for the community, a overview of Raku design, and a technical talk on how to create a good (maybe not excellent) documentation processing and rendering system.

when you want one no okay thank you very

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,150
much

00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:11,759
so hello my name is Gigi Morello say I'm

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,740
gonna talk about the record

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,740
documentation project that's why I'm

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:22,560
calling it don't sing or top Ching or

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:26,220
whatever anyways a little bit about

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:31,710
myself and kind of the record dot

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:34,440
cheering miss chief and yes that's a

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,059
thing we gotta just figure out so it's a

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,629
it's a thing

00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:44,430
I'm also writer of important things so

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:49,309
you work out acronym I'm a sorcerer of

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:52,530
this book is an excellent book six quick

00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:55,020
cinders reference I'm contract bound by

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,680
publishing house to talk about it so

00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,460
please buy it

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,710
please make reviews of it please I mean

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,420
it's a very nice book actually so it is

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,369
a very complete book talking about all

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,510
day excellent and also all things that

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,830
aku has let's get to the point I go to

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,530
talk every my might always going to be

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,430
divided in three different parts as well

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,090
I'm going to talk about the

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,710
documentation project and how it works

00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,770
second and I'm going to talk about how

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,650
the physical part of writing the thing

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,439
actually works so how'd you get to

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,869
something that that's called something

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,460
else as reference or tutorial or a way

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,369
to use that code to to produce have a

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,680
problem I'm actually able to talk out

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,780
one or maybe two futures for

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,840
fragmentation project are for further

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,759
record augmentation first thing the

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,060
mutation is important it's a very

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,560
important thing so it's nothing that you

00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,659
need to have it's something that needs

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,210
to be there and it's something that

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,740
sometimes it's taking us a given mean do

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,750
when you use many languages you might

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,189
pair itself just say okay so that

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,369
there's no competition here so it's

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,380
everything but someone is right not

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,710
mutation and and you need to have

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,270
something simple way of say to have a

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,180
vision for what documentation should be

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,300
or what the competition is is just good

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,860
to be and

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,900
so you really have to document

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,600
everything that's the language because

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,600
if if it's that most mutational have no

00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,190
way to use it so how did you do that so

00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,580
what's the way of doing this kind of

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,290
thing well this is going to be a first

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:33,520
part of my talk so we're going to Tahoe

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:36,070
we get to - from the raw material which

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,100
is which is a recommendation to the

00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:42,790
actual thing that most people sees which

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:47,800
is a that website so first thing is this

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,270
is what six it's what we used to for

00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,170
right an augmentation it's called call

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:56,680
six because it was based on on pod on

00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,970
pearls pod which stands for playing old

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,670
augmentation maybe something totally

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,200
different but tell me nice things and

00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,690
maybe you can you can check them out and

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,860
check them out and this little excerpt

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:11,740
of of code the first thing is that you

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:15,520
see that behind behind pod do you have

00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:19,660
this thing which is actually a hash this

00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:22,860
is actually metadata so within the

00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:25,959
documentation you can also have metadata

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,930
so you can you can describe stuff about

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,190
about the contender that's there that's

00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,040
of course you have the structure right

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,110
so you have the title of the

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,150
documentation page in these cases it's a

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:41,080
class failure it's wrong classes up

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,850
that's in there in raccoon and you have

00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,010
so title for it so you describe what's

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,989
on it and and then you have something

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,340
that behaves as code which is this one

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:51,340
this is actually the duration of the

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:55,060
class and so so first you have world

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:59,530
level markup Francis this is Cole this

00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,840
is this is a italics this is a link and

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,600
so forth right but there's a very

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,790
interesting thing about this the

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,550
specifics and about documentation in

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,500
Araku in general and the thing is that

00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,390
it's part of the language if you think

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,730
about polar or if you think about the

00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,049
commutation immunity their language it's

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,669
basically a comment is it's a mean

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:21,820
everything it's something that that you

00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:24,190
throw away when you compile a page

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,700
that's not the case in record not so a

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,470
very cool

00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,300
for the bath sakes actually it was it

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,800
was the cause why documentation was in

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,780
reading up the same time as a language

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,120
because that we getting the compare was

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,490
very low so if you had to compile the

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,440
code and the illumination was basically

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,730
impossible so so the commutation is not

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,320
it's not really embedded or entangled

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:49,700
into the code it's something that's

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:52,750
that's apart right so but this is also a

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,280
very interesting characteristic of

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:59,630
raccoon I mean it's something called up

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,990
called a braid braid is kind of

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:05,690
different languages that are also

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:08,600
interpreted by my raccoon

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:11,300
so that documentation and this part six

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,370
is part of of a set of braids come by

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,750
defaulting in raccoon the other one

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,820
would be regular expressions for

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,810
instance and another one is crystalline

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:23,030
of a cold so whoops I have their own you

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,700
know brag on your language so this is

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,920
what we have right so we have seen that

00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,050
it's around four hundred pages of the

00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,380
mutation so far so it's something on the

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:37,370
ballpark of five hundred this is what we

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,380
have and this is what we want to have to

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,330
have something that's sexual so we want

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,750
to have something that when you get into

00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:47,060
our website you can search for failure

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:53,450
ripened and you had directly to the page

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:57,530
that there g1 also and somebody's that's

00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:59,570
in the main door not okay I'm going to

00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:03,560
continue but this never happens I mean

00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:05,870
nobody lives here anyway so you want a

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:11,270
suit with findable so you know when

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:13,910
people looks up in in Google or ringing

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,500
dr. glow you want them to find actually

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:19,370
the reference so you wanted to find what

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,650
you are looking for right so you want it

00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,140
to be published in such a way that

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,750
people can actually find but you want

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,250
Street to index out because the

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,950
condition is nothing with such a Google

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,080
index you need to have some pages that

00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,460
that happening that so everything you

00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,190
can't you can't you need to have it

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,330
basically classified so that you can

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:41,009
look it up and and you can

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:44,340
several of faith sets of navigation

00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:47,039
through there and then you to have a

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,219
riff real reference so if there's

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,199
something called defined you should be

00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:54,569
able to look it up easily and you should

00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,189
be able to find it I should have a very

00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:58,199
nice page we work where everything

00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:01,650
that's that defined can can be found

00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,560
right so what do we need with something

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:07,439
which is called documented the common

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,009
table is a tool and it's also a raku

00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:14,879
library it was mainly the work of

00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:21,330
Antonio Grammys was a Google system of

00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:23,129
code aluminum aluminum last year but as

00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:25,469
a matter of fact it kind of put together

00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:26,699
many things that were there but what

00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:30,240
we've gone with with the common tables

00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:32,759
kind of an API for documentation so what

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,529
we want is to have to have a way of you

00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,879
know actually putting everything

00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:42,229
together and making it easily usable

00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,370
from other from other modules initially

00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,289
you know to have an easy way of

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,180
producing everything that I have talked

00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:50,669
about so far so this is classic omentum

00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,490
hobbies you know something like toss on

00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:57,330
select kind something so this is what

00:07:53,490 --> 00:08:00,870
what that that code that we have seen so

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:04,830
far that part six code becomes when we

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:07,650
are actually processing it so it is

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:10,050
actually literary program so I mean this

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,580
doesn't mean that you can't use this pod

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,919
six within your own program actually

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,520
economy intersperse it and every little

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,620
comment in the in the thing I mean a

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,129
little comment in danger it's going to

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,599
be passed

00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:24,360
so it's literal programming you can

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,550
actually include all those data

00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,870
structures and all the kind of

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:32,219
documentation structure within it so

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,949
it's it's a very interesting concept and

00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,899
it's something that we we we can work

00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:40,469
with and we should really work with it

00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:42,570
so what do we do then remember the

00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:44,570
documentation is called so we can

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:47,490
actually pre-compile it we can cache it

00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,470
so in the same way that you can install

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,540
any any module with on the second thing

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,190
with the documentation so instead of

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,930
going through the text

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,390
every time parsing it you know creatine

00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,980
AST everything no no you really have

00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,890
that you have the bytecode you gonna

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,620
store it so that's the first thing you

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:07,260
do we kind of marinate the commutation

00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:11,070
same way that this salmon is marinated

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,110
so we marinated and and we put it into a

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,080
series of files it is this was actually

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,840
the work of mainly Antonio meat was was

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,760
a the higher level theme but richer

00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,970
things were actually this one set was

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,800
called out to cash this is probably

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,260
going to change in the future but but

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,630
for the time being the basic idea is you

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,690
have a documentation to catch it so the

00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,740
next time you need to work with it you

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,100
don't have to compile it all over again

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,770
which you know where it was very slow

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,530
but you just usually the cash you

00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,060
already have right the second thing is

00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,550
you have to register with because

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,100
remember you have to index everything we

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,870
have so that you can easily reference it

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,820
could initially create pages or or a

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,820
field we can easily create this this

00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,370
little search you know its lot that we

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,050
have in the page so we use something

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,120
which is called the document able

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,430
registry so the committed you already

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,860
series like a higher level thing where

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,630
do you where you have all the data

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,260
structure and all the things that you

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:15,780
have extracted from that documentation

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:18,420
there a statute right and anguish the

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:22,500
cache as I said so we this is actually

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:24,840
part of the human table Cole so what we

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,940
do is we need the cash we initialize a

00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:30,720
cache when we start to to work with it

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:32,730
and then well when we and good produce

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,260
new new documentation whatever the only

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,410
thing we did to this to to look at the

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,180
cache see if it's current if there's

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,400
something new you have data cache and

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,700
then you you produce the new pages

00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,110
quite easily so you pass your index you

00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,490
repeat you to that all over again

00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,740
so one of the good things about

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,170
documental is that before we needed to

00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,120
process that the whole thing all of one

00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:57,390
said there was no way no physical way of

00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,030
of just refreshing the HTML pages that

00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:03,300
were generated form from once from one

00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:06,250
single document now we can do that so

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,260
that in fact if there's only one page

00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:12,720
only the pages are having created for it

00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:15,160
are going to be around to be changed and

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,680
Judah all the time

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,910
anytime eventually you need to generate

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,080
HTML so that you have to work with the

00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,210
reef structures you have you have to

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,920
work with the blades and you have to

00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,980
take it account several things so that

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:34,420
eventually you produce something there

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:36,220
so this is the text had produces that

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:40,510
kind of thing that's something good

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:44,050
there anyway looks like to work anyway

00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,400
so what you have is a something that's

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:51,340
called a secondary so we have the

00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:53,410
primary which is a synthetic page that

00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,150
we generate Francis for refresher or

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:58,000
whatever the secondaries should you know

00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:01,180
the the page we generate from from that

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,400
and then we we generate HTML so

00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:07,530
eventually what you have is an HTML page

00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:11,050
that's even to republish these takes

00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:14,500
right now takes around like four or five

00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:16,180
minutes it's so much actually this if

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,390
you generated the whole documentation

00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:21,760
from from the 400 or 450 documents if

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,160
you are just going to generate like one

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,290
page or two pages or whatever it takes

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,190
maybe a few seconds so it's it's really

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:32,110
really fast before it took like 20 30

00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,390
minutes was absolutely amazing

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,900
soon as you see they actually did this a

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:41,100
while ago so this is what you do you you

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:44,950
process a different directories and you

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:47,860
regenerate HTML and then you ship it so

00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:50,710
you copy it to to the infrastructure

00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,840
that's provided by Rome Obama and I

00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:58,270
think so we're very grateful for that

00:12:52,840 --> 00:13:00,700
and but you see it's it's just static

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:04,660
HTML so it is there's nothing dynamic

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:07,030
about it I mean this is quite cool

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,910
because whether it's save deleted you

00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:12,820
need to deploy sanity next server and

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:16,120
then to crime some some kind of let's

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:19,150
say configuration a variety because you

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,310
need to assume so fixes and things like

00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,060
that so it's no

00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:26,430
but with this deploy and you can etch

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,730
tml pages and it's quite fast to serve

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:31,379
so it's it's a that's quite good I think

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,180
that that might change in the future at

00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:36,420
first I mean I think it works pretty

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,110
well we do this by hand anyway I do this

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,999
my hat

00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,209
so that that's something that could

00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:44,819
improve him in the future

00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:46,709
but then you'd actually need to write

00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:49,470
the documentation so it's something that

00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:53,249
that's the technical part there's a

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,720
solemn kind of say development part

00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,509
where you actually need to write a

00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,059
limitation right so the first thing is

00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:03,329
that you need to find out about what

00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:06,720
needs to be document right so it's the

00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:08,370
thing is that way with with running it

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,009
out they said do you need to know what

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,290
new features are there so when something

00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:15,149
wants something changes do me - no it's

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:18,689
change Macklin there's some change in

00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:20,279
the syntax notice there's no some new

00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:22,709
feature whatever you need to find out I

00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:24,540
mean it's not like you are kind of

00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:26,339
working through the source code or

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,610
looking up every commit that would be

00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:32,970
absolutely I mean time consuming and I

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:35,370
would be impossible but you need to find

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,589
out find out when this documentation is

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:40,350
changing or what something is saying how

00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:44,809
do we do that that we will do it now is

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:49,550
that we find out changes in release

00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:51,930
change talks there is a change document

00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,930
every time there's a new release for the

00:14:51,930 --> 00:15:01,050
service a new release in Africa last

00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:03,089
with 2020 dot zero six and with passes

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:06,059
change change law using this script it's

00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:07,850
just this script there's nothing much

00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,970
more to it so that the change law

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:15,569
contains all the changes are having main

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:18,389
new features so syntax of course

00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:19,860
contains something expected performance

00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:20,939
improvements and things I know that

00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,589
we're not interested in that I mean

00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:23,939
we're not going to change the

00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,889
commentators today this is faster and

00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:29,639
then again and say this is even faster

00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:32,759
so it's it's just you know when the

00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,930
syntax of some some methods on routine

00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:35,580
changes or

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,010
stuff like that right so this is

00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:44,360
something that we can do the key here is

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:49,320
that in this this command this statement

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,480
we actually linked the comet word that

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,100
change was made

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,560
this is section because we need to

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,020
understand why something has happened in

00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,330
order to document it this is relatively

00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,330
recent so it is not something that you

00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,580
have to be able to do it forever

00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:08,459
but something that's very convenient now

00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,920
so from this we produce a markdown

00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:13,170
document this markdown document is

00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,970
copied and pasted into it went into

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:18,480
issue so every time there is a new

00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,830
release you get this fresh list of

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,779
things that you need to change into

00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,060
augmentation right with a checklist and

00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:26,190
everything and you can work on that

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:30,240
that's very good and that really helps a

00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:32,279
lot but who I mean once you have that or

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,630
even before you have that there were

00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,339
some things that need to be documented

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,770
and they are not in those in those

00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,900
release change Docs so you need to

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,240
really find out what something does and

00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,370
then you find something like this

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:47,070
freezes you need to find out when you do

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:50,760
a concatenation of two junctions what's

00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:55,860
gonna happen good thing is that most of

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:58,470
rikudou is written in red so now we

00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,980
clearing it is sign language but there's

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:06,870
a part of it that's fitting in QB n QP

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:09,089
is not quite pearl so it's it's a it's

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:11,449
like a simplified language is the one

00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:15,750
that actually generates the right call

00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:18,360
but I mean check this out this is only

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:21,120
like like that first quarter of it of

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,620
the thing so you if you need to parse

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:28,530
this down it's gonna be hard so it's

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:31,080
hard to do under some of these tests so

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:33,540
you can just say okay so what I do is I

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,929
concatenate reductions and and that's it

00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:39,059
but that's known as someone finding this

00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:42,270
could really find it in that out yet

00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:45,000
they just a lot of the the signature so

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,540
you really really need to find out what

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,620
it lasts right

00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:53,770
in this case you might want to find out

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:56,850
what it does in many different ways you

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:59,560
have to use the context right and blame

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:03,640
helps with the context so you can go to

00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:06,370
github you can or you can directly get

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,570
you can use keyed blame and in this case

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:14,350
what you see is that Elizabeth Madison

00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:17,830
did this change the specific change did

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:22,300
30 level and did it with this specific

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:24,790
comment so you kind of find out where

00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:27,610
that was wrong you can even go a little

00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:30,040
bit further and say okay what was the

00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:32,380
commit message that did it and you find

00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:36,040
this is very helpful

00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:39,880
everything that Liz Wright is absolutely

00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:41,830
excellent everything most people write

00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,530
in ruku is absolutely excellent in the

00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:48,040
commit message it really helps but in

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:50,890
some cases remember so if it's all coded

00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,200
it's difficult to find out but overall

00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:56,920
if there are several layers of code with

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,000
different with different time every time

00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,760
at different times of different days

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,090
whatever this guy's say okay so what it

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,430
does is I'm going to work with Junction

00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:08,290
steer and I steer the engine number and

00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:10,480
whatever so I know what what this is

00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:13,990
doing and this kind of provides an

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,030
explanation kind of provides a less

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:19,090
sentence that you can reuse for the

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:20,710
documentation but you can go even a

00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:22,330
little bit further than that because the

00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,720
problem with called is that not

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:28,120
everything raku do it right and that may

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:32,170
seem like paradise but it's sucky like

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,650
that why because a specification is not

00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:38,410
the same as a code is not the same as

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:40,990
implementation there are three different

00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:44,350
things here first is the specification

00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:46,360
specification is is something that needs

00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:50,910
to work in a particular way this work in

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:53,950
a specific way the specification is in

00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:55,630
Rose is the Ross repository so if

00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,830
something is in gross do you know that

00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,050
it's going to work that way

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,490
in mid-stroke that way and you're so

00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,020
have an example which is helpful

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,540
in this case you have this sample right

00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,610
here so you can actually go on and use

00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:10,540
directly example for documentation

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:13,800
that's actually very good but in some

00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:17,140
other cases it's not Frank Frank ooh

00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:20,950
right that means that it belongs to the

00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:25,540
raku implementation but it needn't be

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:27,400
there in the future so you have done

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:30,030
something because it's helpful to for a

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,430
secondary class for or whatever and

00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:35,200
people can use it so it's expose it is

00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:37,480
published to the public its public API

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,450
and people can you see that it's rikudou

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,600
so it might change if it's not a spec if

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:46,330
it's not part of the specification it

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,770
might change right and then there are

00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,480
implementation issues there are some

00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,920
things that that that outcome because

00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,170
they are convenient for implementation

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:58,300
in some cases they are interfacing in

00:20:53,170 --> 00:21:02,050
some cases they are not and you need to

00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,340
document them or not I mean it in the

00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,250
case of Raccoon you basically it's

00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:08,410
really a judgment call so it's I mean

00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,580
you really have to think about I'm not

00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,150
sure it's it's a matter of priorities

00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:15,340
because the first thing you need to to

00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:19,380
document this spec then rikudou

00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:22,780
then eventually meditation fortunately

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,520
very recently we had something that was

00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,610
called its implementation and detailed

00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,620
so we really really can't find out when

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,820
when something is an implementation

00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,370
detail or not we will get to that a

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,800
little bit later of course you need to

00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:37,960
understand what it does because since

00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,510
two or three examples to short every

00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,520
single examples doesn't mean that you

00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,650
understand where it does it doesn't

00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,810
really mean that you can explain what it

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,550
does because at the end of the day in

00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,350
documentation do you need to splain you

00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:52,450
need to tell people this is doing this

00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:55,450
kind of thing in all these cases right

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,340
and just representing the syntax and

00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,320
doing what was in their specification

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,180
with slightly different names it's not

00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,520
gonna correct it's not going to be

00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,740
enough for people to really start to use

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,270
a particular feature in their code which

00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,490
is what we are looking for real

00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,860
commutation so you really need to find

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,170
out you need me to understand the code

00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,250
right

00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,170
they eventually do you need to produce

00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:21,240
examples there are samples of all over I

00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:23,820
will be hard-pressed to tell how many

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:28,350
but they are proving the tens of

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:30,990
thousands probably like 40,000 or

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:33,810
something like that and every one of

00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:37,140
them needs to reflect and these two to

00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:39,690
show intent not syntax syntax is cc

00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:43,260
just look out the reference say okay so

00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:45,660
what I put D here is a time where I put

00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,820
there it's kind of thing and I'm gonna

00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:49,830
get an array of that so you create an

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,960
example with with some array called foo

00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,330
amber and bath button and that's it and

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,820
you're done and that's something I

00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:59,820
didn't assign I think right so it's okay

00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:02,900
but you actually need to tell people how

00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:05,970
to use that in their code you need to

00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:08,940
express intent you need to express them

00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:11,640
and actually use case so first this this

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:16,740
is one was done by my yard time I'll

00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:19,370
have Alex day it's actually it shows who

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,780
is implementation details little quirks

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:26,040
that's a trade was introduced very

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:28,590
recently like type of release by risk is

00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,630
back and it's just for instance that you

00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:35,820
have felt which is which is a Cole

00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:38,610
routine so you do check it out and you

00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,950
see that fells is an implementation lit

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:42,660
up and then you show something that's

00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,940
called a private corporation up cool

00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,830
it's not full of bars private

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,780
calculation so you know that something

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,770
is a public calculation and that's the

00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,930
kind of thing that's an implementation

00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,180
it up and that's the kind of thing that

00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:58,050
you should use its implementation detail

00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:00,180
with right so instead of just using foo

00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:02,130
and bar and whatever do you show that

00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:04,140
people if they are going to put

00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,430
something in their implementation and

00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,660
it's going to mean implementation detail

00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,200
which means that it may change in the

00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,900
future

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,850
so it might it's something that was

00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:15,870
useful you know what's on forward for

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:18,900
some reason it's not a spec so it can

00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,890
use exactly this way so this is a very

00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,430
good example and this is what we're

00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,570
looking for

00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:26,490
not all of the examples are like that so

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:28,770
we're trying to improve them and

00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:30,780
can't really help if you see some

00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,340
example that that's not this kind of

00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:36,840
thing is if you see something that's

00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:39,720
less than awesome please just tell us

00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,179
racing issue it's a it's a living thing

00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,690
it's something that that's evolving all

00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:47,280
the time is change so we mutually you

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:51,870
need all the help we can get

00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:54,750
besides if you create an example can go

00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:57,980
viral so just think about it

00:24:54,750 --> 00:25:01,170
seeing your statement to statement

00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:04,170
statements repeated over and over and

00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:06,210
kanuk Stack Overflow questions in you

00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:09,150
know in some other code that because at

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,890
the end of the day people start to work

00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,080
on their code by taking the example

00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,190
setter and documentation or taking

00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,650
something from a stack overflow

00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,960
then maybe modify it just a little tiny

00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:21,480
bits as a matter of fact they're having

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,370
such thing as samples of this elaborate

00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,990
cup so if you look look up the code of

00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,880
particular examples in the documentation

00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,679
do you look at the mummy in github and

00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,620
you will find three or four copies or

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:39,030
whatever so it's not really like final

00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:42,570
final but you know tiny bit via what we

00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:47,160
have now is around 100,000 I sort of

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:49,230
made Asia which is a lot it's I mean

00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,000
it's like a pile of books a big pile of

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,550
books

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,980
actually I realize it's covered today we

00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:58,460
have 100,000 lines of documentation so

00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:03,960
everything that sometimes in April or

00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:08,190
maybe May that line was written remember

00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,470
that I would say that around 10k lines

00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:12,870
of documentation are produced every year

00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,370
which is a good thing a dream agree I

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:17,010
started to work in the material was

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:21,090
around 70,000 something like that so in

00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:23,040
three years its wing 33 camera and

00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:25,559
that's a good thing and it's because

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,980
lots of people are working on

00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:33,630
documentation we have a certain certain

00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:35,250
0.5 K commit that's not like a lot I

00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,760
mean if you look at for instance a

00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,720
rikudou

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,310
there are around

00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:45,550
33 okay nice of cold I mean commit

00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:47,980
disguise it's 3.5 K could be better or

00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:52,330
still and bloody be happy about it and

00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:54,520
there are around 262 contributors and 37

00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:56,950
in the last year so 37 people have

00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,400
contributed the deluxe in the last 12

00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:59,500
months

00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,280
and I really thank you for that I mean

00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,200
it's it's really it's really good I mean

00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:08,170
the thing is that part of documentation

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,210
is very nice because you learn lots of

00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:14,590
things about the nuts and bolts of rikuo

00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:17,080
you get to to check out amazing cold you

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:20,800
get to interact with amazing programmers

00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,890
and and so soft but some parts of it is

00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,510
really grant work if you have something

00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,800
like a method that has changed in three

00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,680
different classes or in five different

00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,570
classes you really have to go through

00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:34,800
just think if you look at for instance a

00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:38,080
day at the specification of 36 pointing

00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:41,890
that's the still not home there were

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:45,520
around 260 different features that were

00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:47,710
introduced there and we're eight eight

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:54,430
feature short of producing augmentation

00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:57,430
for 460 which was releasing 2017 prime

00:27:54,430 --> 00:28:01,750
know anything so we are we're still I

00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:05,680
mean we're behind what I'm saying is

00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:08,020
that it's nice work is but it won't give

00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,000
work and I'm really grateful and then

00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,130
the Rocco community is really great

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,860
effort due to all these people who who

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,870
really sometimes have to sit down and

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:20,620
write some stuff at that at the end of

00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:24,640
there is some hard work to do but let's

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:26,950
look into the future I think that there

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,790
are many things that can be done in a

00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:34,420
better way the of course we're looking

00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:37,840
for is is more documentation better

00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:40,270
documentation but we also want to have

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,580
something like more automation kind of

00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:44,470
for instance there are some most things

00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,380
are not automated right now so just

00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:50,440
imagine that someone creates a new a new

00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,580
syntax or a new feature whatever right

00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,620
now we're doing is

00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:56,920
every time there is a police we manually

00:28:53,620 --> 00:29:01,150
check out the changelog and see what was

00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:04,090
there we might miss some stuff and also

00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:06,640
the has been done or only in in the in

00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:10,060
the last two years so I mean it's not

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,970
really a lot of time so we should really

00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:14,980
find our way of comparing the

00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,530
documentation with a source call and

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,480
finding out if there's something missing

00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:23,950
there after this there's something wrong

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:27,760
or many other ways I mean first a system

00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:29,920
if some new some new stuff is probably

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,500
some new method or or whatever it is

00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,600
there there are parts of documentation

00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,070
which is just boilerplate this method is

00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,440
called that way this is a signature of

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:41,050
the metal it does this and that and in

00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,810
many kind of things could be at least

00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:45,760
initially we produce automatically I

00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:50,230
think that's something we need to do

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:53,050
right also save some boilerplate right

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:55,250
in there I say there's some boilerplate

00:29:53,050 --> 00:30:00,200
for instance

00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:03,540
limitation with which describes all the

00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,120
classes that are super classes to a

00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:09,120
particular one do you need to write that

00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,470
into a different file and that I mean

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,470
that's something that we have been

00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:15,420
wanting to change for for a long time if

00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,120
you use introspection in records you can

00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:21,060
you can get up very easily so it's

00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,580
something so that could be wrong I mean

00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:25,140
really many many things I mean we we

00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,450
could use in introspection we could use

00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:30,960
parsing of rock by rock ooh there's many

00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:32,910
things to at least produce some you know

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,040
some initial document a song or somebody

00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:37,170
bread that you can't you have to fill in

00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,060
which right now we are not doing there

00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:42,180
is a script that produces like like the

00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:44,880
template for a documentation page but

00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:46,920
that's it and that that's not nice we

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,830
could save a lot of stuff so part of

00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:54,300
that the crab current grant work that we

00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:57,300
are doing say I can still like something

00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,650
like the great unification of dogs which

00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,860
is something that we have been looking

00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:04,920
for for for some time it's going to

00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:07,350
start being possible right now basic

00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,650
idea is a right now document of all is

00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:12,000
written for documentation and that's it

00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:15,780
so if you want to produce the

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,390
commutation for your module it's what we

00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:20,970
heard you will have to ask Antonio and

00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:24,840
me and some other people cause why do

00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:28,190
these do I do that so it's not like you

00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,780
can simply point document a wall at

00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:33,420
repository or whatever I want the docs

00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:36,540
of these and it produces very nice HTML

00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:38,840
I could really love to have something

00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:43,470
like that it's even a little bit worse

00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:46,640
because right now the there was

00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:50,250
something called p6 doc which stopped

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:53,880
working but then right now we have a

00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:55,140
raccoon dog raku dos X is also looking

00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,100
at documentation from the command line

00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:03,480
and ragu doc should be unified in a

00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:07,620
better way with documental which right

00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,070
now is not really like that we have

00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:12,279
specific stock it's still

00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:14,070
and the repository and therefore today

00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:17,370
we should work that and take it out and

00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:20,799
you suck look anyway the point is that

00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:23,159
we should have like a unified way of

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,169
working with any kind of documentation

00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:28,470
within any kind of money using any kind

00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:31,929
of template and you see it very easy

00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:34,840
stop that's crappy real good I'll be

00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:37,149
happy and finally we have to streamline

00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:40,720
release on deployment right now we

00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:43,120
really don't have releases we have

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,279
releases but they they're kind of kind

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,679
of an you're kind of a check mine what I

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,169
say okay so the I'm gonna stop right

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,480
here we want to remember what happened

00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:54,340
this specific moment in time so we are

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,850
going to release this but we don't

00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:00,600
really have releases so we can't really

00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:03,730
say that right now we have the 6d

00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,129
release of the commutation because first

00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:08,649
art starters I mean the specification is

00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:11,049
not really documented so we can we can't

00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:16,240
really do it the second thing is that

00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:17,710
the well we should kind of kind of be

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,460
easy for people to just install

00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:21,700
documentation

00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:24,129
yes self stop doc and that's it news

00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:27,190
documentation right now you can do it

00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:28,600
but you will still have to produce HTML

00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,940
documentation and at the end of the day

00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,279
is much easier to just look it up on the

00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,259
Internet so we should really work on

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,210
that this one's Internet and of course

00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:40,360
we should have same plan deployment

00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:43,480
right now it's on my hand because why I

00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:46,559
stepped on behan we do it automatically

00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,149
by Poland and the repository every time

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,889
sometimes the state that commutation is

00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:53,139
seeing is not really the best one

00:33:50,889 --> 00:33:57,580
because you want to fix something before

00:33:53,139 --> 00:33:59,590
it's deployed so I mean both things go

00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:02,289
hand in hand you can do deployment if

00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:04,620
you don't have any strategy and the

00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:07,179
other ground you have kind of a of a

00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:09,460
quality check before you actually deploy

00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:11,859
something you can just deploy everything

00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,359
something also master or if you deploy

00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:15,669
every time something also message is

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:19,179
called a development branch and work on

00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:22,089
that and not work on the master branch

00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:22,589
is you know what we do now so that's

00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:26,190
sort of

00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:27,809
like to have at the end of the day if I

00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:31,799
think that Brock was really a machine

00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:33,690
language it's for mid-swing quite a

00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:36,450
discovery and having you know working

00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:39,659
with many different languages of my life

00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:41,849
of programmer and request

00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:44,009
Grilli on a machine language but really

00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:46,379
needs a machine documentation so it's

00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:50,849
something that we need to do it's not

00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:53,149
something that we have I can save it I

00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:56,219
mean the mutation is good enough it's

00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:57,719
it's got too hot but we really need to

00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:01,829
work on that and the whole community

00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:03,779
needs to to be aware that that by having

00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:05,099
an excellent documentation people more

00:35:03,779 --> 00:35:06,960
people will be able to use the language

00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:08,880
much more people will be introduced to

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,559
the language and the less people would

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,499
be discouraged from traditional language

00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,029
because if they don't find a real way of

00:35:12,499 --> 00:35:19,799
performing some operation that they want

00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:23,160
to do so we really need your help you

00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:25,619
can stop in many ways but just looking

00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,900
at documentation finding out some some

00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:30,450
something that doesn't you know it's not

00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,549
right creating an issue even the

00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:35,849
submitting upon request do be very very

00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:38,369
welcome and thanks a lot for identity

00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:41,210
stock I don't know I think we have time

00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:41,210
for a few questions

00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:50,299
sure question leader raise your own

00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:50,299
unmute yourself from the master equation

00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:12,180
I think you can get a lot more people

00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:15,900
participating in documentation just a

00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,940
very simple way to allow users to write

00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,519
markdown and have it automatically

00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,450
converted to a politics language and

00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,229
that was just wondering about your

00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,670
thoughts on that

00:36:22,229 --> 00:36:27,539
is that something that I've completely

00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:30,790
missed or is is that something that just

00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:32,800
Oh needs to be done

00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,680
in this video I mean you're very right

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,480
because about six if you look at it on

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,400
the face of it is second gated language

00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,400
I mean it's it's a mark it's a markup

00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,530
language it's lots of stuff went back

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,630
and forth so some people might say okay

00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:49,390
I need to do this but who do I really

00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:51,700
put code here will be nice if we have

00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:53,410
markdown the problem is again to

00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:56,140
streamline that kind of thing so to

00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:58,000
actually create a workflow that allows

00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:00,730
people to read something back now that's

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,980
converted automatically into into into

00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,710
pod six and then and then to be able to

00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,000
introduce it into them in today I mean

00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,180
it's something that we could we could

00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,720
give some some thoughts and it's a real

00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:15,820
excellent idea I really love it but off

00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,280
the top of my head it wasn't would need

00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:21,690
some some serious tooling for for making

00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,690
it work thank you very much

00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:41,330
in your door questions I have a comment

00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:44,330
that is the need for examples in the in

00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:47,150
the documentation is really great I

00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:50,420
there's so much stuff that I once I read

00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:53,480
it I still have no clue what you know

00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:55,550
what it means and what to do and it'd be

00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:00,380
nice because the features look really

00:37:55,550 --> 00:38:02,690
good yeah you know it's something that

00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,730
we can't provide example for every

00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:06,620
single thing that we have there but I

00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:09,380
still we try to have as many samples as

00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:12,800
possible and that those examples are

00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,210
really useful and quite directly as a

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,150
matter of fact we compile a by simple

00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:19,640
single example so we make sure that

00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,800
every single example is really there I

00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:25,540
mean it can can really work with with

00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,540
current so yeah

00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:41,840
so if we have no more question okay good

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:57,510
question our or feedback marking tool no

00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:59,940
no sorry okay so we have plenty of time

00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:04,920
for question if you're self feel free to

00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:10,130
raise your own or speech otherwise I

00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,130
think we can close the station earlier I

00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:21,300
am not sure is I just wanted to say

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,940
thank you that it's been documented will

00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:28,920
represent something that I was dreaming

00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:32,369
of for the documentation you know like

00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,450
five or six years ago so I just wanted

00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:37,790
to say thank you for all the hard work

00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:43,440
and we keep we'll keep pushing more

00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:46,130
documentation you're already welcome to

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,410
help thank you very much

00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:53,100
never premature yeah hi I have a

00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:54,240
question so first of all JJ Wow you guys

00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:58,470
have done great job with the

00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,420
documentation I use it all the time and

00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:02,580
and that's saying something coming from

00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:05,910
you know my history with with Perl 6 and

00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:07,619
rokku with respect to the question about

00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:09,150
making good examples of first of all we

00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:12,060
all know it's really hard to come up

00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:14,940
with good examples if somebody said I

00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:17,609
really wish there was an example I could

00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:20,040
use an example on such-and-such page is

00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:23,040
there a process or what would be the

00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,750
process to just be able to get a note to

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,180
the people writing documentation that

00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:29,369
hey this is a spot where we could really

00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:33,030
use an example is would it be by filing

00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:35,790
a github issue or what yeah luckily yes

00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:38,760
that's fine an issue would be of course

00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:41,430
right now we have 440 issues so it's

00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:44,220
it's not ideal either but we let me try

00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:46,980
get down to it I mean sometimes just

00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:48,160
people pick up issues and they start to

00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,650
write now

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,110
write it down sometimes the persons who

00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:56,130
have done it actually in ruku say that's

00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:58,690
a okay so why not read on a sample here

00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:01,060
so but the right way is they're doing an

00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:03,520
issue yeah because it's there and

00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:06,540
anybody can pick it up and I will commit

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:09,490
I I think I might work on some issues

00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,720
thank you that would be I think I think

00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,160
there would be a lot of fun in it would

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:17,770
be somewhere where I think I can come in

00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,730
and like again again again great job to

00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:21,250
everybody who's working on the

00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:30,130
documentation team I really do use the

00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:32,260
site a lot it looks like some pages on

00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:35,230
the docs have an edit button that

00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:37,450
immediately to take I mean you have to

00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:42,490
be logged into github did but you can

00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:45,160
edit a page that way do example well it

00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:47,830
creates a pull request actually what

00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:51,970
you're going to do all the pages are

00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:54,840
tired not secondary pages have not been

00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:57,520
generated from from something else

00:41:54,840 --> 00:42:00,310
actually I mean they take you straight

00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,370
to the to the page of let's give me one

00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:06,340
second because my laptop is running out

00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:09,400
of juice so I need to play reading so

00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:12,720
the thing is that you can you go

00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,670
straight to edit the page in it have and

00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:18,250
if you have the Braves to do edit it I

00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:19,900
mean we just go to master if it does

00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:22,960
send it would create a pull request and

00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:24,910
the pull request will be reviewed by me

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,260
or someone else and and we'll check it

00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:29,470
out and we'll suggest maybe some changes

00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:32,050
or whatever so what but just a member

00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:33,850
please that please please by all means

00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,530
if you see something that's wrong even a

00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:38,830
type or or some grammar error whatever

00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:41,140
just just do it I mean as soon as you do

00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:44,830
the pull request it will we will run

00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:49,900
some some tests in it basically some

00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:53,200
style well we have some standards so the

00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:55,600
tire was a kind of enforced and then we

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,040
are prove it and it's published in the

00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,380
next release so

00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,580
so please do serve I mean it's something

00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,880
that that's been there from from the

00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,050
video inning and we

00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:14,230
really grateful for them Franklin

00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:16,070
devotional comes that way most good

00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:18,530
thank you

00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:21,320
this tie is heavily into Michael's

00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:24,560
question and into your answer that you

00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:27,140
just gave my hit my history with the

00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:31,340
documentation is besides contributing

00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:34,280
some years ago a good bit at all the

00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:36,860
hackathons in several years I haven't

00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,750
tried anytime somebody comes in and says

00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,610
I want to do something on Perl 6 but I

00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:43,340
don't know what I put them among the

00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:46,010
documentation and that that has the dual

00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,870
effect of we get beginners eyes that

00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:49,580
that effect you can't duplicate because

00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:51,950
you and I can't read the documentation

00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:55,490
and find errors that they could spot

00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:57,680
because we've read it too many times but

00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:59,420
also because then they nobody gets more

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,250
than ten minutes in before saying oh

00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:04,220
that's cool how does that work and then

00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:06,920
they're all on some some actual coding

00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:10,730
project but for people who do want to

00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:14,050
participate do you have a how to

00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:16,280
contribute document that summarizes

00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:19,400
essentially the answer you just gave to

00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:22,240
Michael of okay the way you contribute

00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:25,010
to this step is click this button and

00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:28,760
here's where our standards are and so

00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:30,890
forth yeah I mean it's straight out in

00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,260
the repositories it's a contribution and

00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:35,690
guide I mean it's planes webspot six

00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:38,960
planes kind of small standard civilian

00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:41,660
for some documentation and so on so

00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,120
forth but and we have uh so you're

00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,920
sitting in sometimes with the thing

00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:48,230
called squash atoms with which we

00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,500
stopped doing for for some reasons so I

00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:53,510
kind I can kind of look it up and paste

00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:56,330
it on on the on the chat if you want or

00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:59,120
or maybe share it but we have that kind

00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:01,550
of thing in general you know if you look

00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:03,980
at the documentation and you have some

00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:05,600
contribution that's grammar or something

00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,770
like that you know some some mistakes

00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,260
for instance in a variable name or

00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:11,270
whatever we just accept it straight away

00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:14,900
so it's it's not something that goes

00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:16,539
through many layers of approval

00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:20,119
so I mean just encourage people to

00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:22,369
change whatever they want I mean at the

00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:24,049
Medic worst somebody will tell them well

00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:27,799
maybe you should do this was not that

00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:31,849
way I mean but most probably it's going

00:45:27,799 --> 00:45:35,599
to be accepted almost straight away okay

00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:38,180
I'm looking more towards people who will

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,710
go through and say I read that and it

00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:42,619
doesn't make sense to me I don't know

00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:46,609
what I should put in its place but that

00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:48,109
I want to alert somebody that that does

00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:51,109
not communicate what I think it's

00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:54,559
supposed to keep yeah yeah I mean this

00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:57,170
thing will be to raise an issue okay

00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:00,680
so issues and the contribution

00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:01,369
guidelines that that's the on-ramp Diane

00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:23,119
thank you

00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:25,309
I believe thank you very much pages of

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,890
documentation or maybe about topics of

00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:35,000
chapter all most visited in the web you

00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:39,369
say about pages and pages are more

00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:44,779
usable and 40 pages users users look

00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:47,779
thank you yeah I kind of do because for

00:46:44,779 --> 00:46:49,789
some reason Google started to send me

00:46:47,779 --> 00:46:52,490
reports of what people were visiting I

00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:55,760
really don't know why because we don't

00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:57,770
have any kind of you know this is this

00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,250
back of the coupon on the pages so that

00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:08,980
Google finds out everything everyone is

00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:12,200
visiting I would have to look it up but

00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:14,900
I will get back to you later

00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:17,720
I really don't remember I happened to

00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:19,520
look it up that but but yes we have some

00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,890
kind of report we also have the loss

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:27,170
which to tell you the truth I don't

00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:28,460
really look up so if I remember

00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:31,730
correctly

00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:34,400
most people start by visiting one for

00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:36,800
the index pages like Florence's tutorial

00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,500
pages about about language input/output

00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,810
things like that so it's not like they

00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:44,630
are really trying to find some specific

00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:46,369
class or or anything like that but I

00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:50,420
mean it's something we really need to

00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:54,170
find out because we need to make easy

00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:56,780
for people to discover things starting

00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:59,230
from anywhere on the side so if we find

00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:02,420
out that some some specific pages is the

00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:05,560
entry page for foreigners everyone we

00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:08,180
should really take care of that and and

00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:10,160
you know work with it very carefully so

00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,750
that it's it's easy for people to use

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,230
and to go to other places if they are

00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:18,140
not actually trying to find to find that

00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:20,540
out so the things that we don't want to

00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:23,099
introduce any any tracking code into the

00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:26,819
pages because that's

00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:28,920
to give Google or any other company all

00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:32,190
kinds of information about what people

00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:34,170
are visiting now or a while but but

00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:36,719
still we can we can use the locks and

00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:39,180
check it out and it's something we

00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:41,690
should really should really do so it's a

00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,690
good question
