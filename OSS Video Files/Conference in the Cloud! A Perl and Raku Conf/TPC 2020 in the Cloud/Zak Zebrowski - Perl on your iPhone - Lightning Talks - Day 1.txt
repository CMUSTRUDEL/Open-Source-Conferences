00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:09,210
okay Zach Europe awesome so I'm Zach

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,120
Zebrowski I actually had previously

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,269
chaired my slice to the sharing thing on

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,510
github so everyone should have that full

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,100
access to the slides my name is Zach I'm

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:27,000
going to talk about putting Perl on a

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:35,610
cell phone and anytime you want to wake

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:39,059
fans in my system chest freeze okay

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,520
things are cops'll okay so there's an

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,660
application called termas which one runs

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,450
on android it's basically a terminal

00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,430
UNIX environment and we looked sort of

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,289
where the name came from

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,020
basically it's a user land application

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,090
that allows applications to run in the

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,620
background it does not require real

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,899
advice it is quite good to just sort of

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,060
have a play environment on your cell

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,170
phone it does have some limitations not

00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,229
because it's not an Intel processor

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,840
there may be some weird bugs also the

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:19,140
file system sort of kind of looks like

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,290
UNIX but it's not so there may be some

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,320
sort of weird no sightings that happens

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,840
but regardless is still the cool tool to

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,020
play with you want to go to term XCOM

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,689
it's a sort of see like their main web

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,630
page is you can directly install it from

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:40,229
the Android Play Store or the f-droid

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:44,130
Play Store I'm going to go on to the

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:46,320
next slide so here's the next slide and

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,500
so miss ructions download from the place

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,579
or then you want to run package update

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:57,180
package upgrade - why package install

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,560
and then build essential so basically I

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,070
will give you a nice little dev

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,290
environment if you then after you do the

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,250
package install build essential install

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:10,770
cpad - you now have a seat pad on your

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,900
cell phone which is actually pretty darn

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,670
cool on the right of the screen if he

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,030
cancel

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:20,930
to see it that's actually the Pearl - be

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:22,819
it's running pro and then you can do

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,650
some fun things again because of the

00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:28,099
fact that some things just won't quite

00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,440
work you may start installing a module

00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,970
which imports about 40 different modules

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,270
one of them at work because it's

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,280
expecting a finally different location I

00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:41,480
try to get some CGI applications to work

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,060
but I did not have any luck so I'm

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,780
hoping to set up the smoker tester at

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,140
some point because I think it'll be cool

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,540
to have full Sipan on your cell phone

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,850
so on the next slide I have a demo

00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,549
I think the SS aging from my cygwin

00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:01,400
environment over to my lap to my cell

00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:03,650
phone and I'm going to install a pro

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:09,950
module that I wrote a long time ago that

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:12,230
just works so carry him on my laptop is

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,220
Scott we're connecting to a weird port

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:20,030
which is 8000 plus the default port a

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:23,390
22-4 SSH it says welcome to termites and

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:27,829
we can then do fine at Sipan an install

00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:31,420
fine that's alone and it works and just

00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:34,010
to further show you that indeed c-pen is

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:37,510
its pearls working normally

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:40,489
I'll run a sample application here

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:43,730
it looks like clinics it feels like

00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:46,220
clinics it's a lot slower than Linux but

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:49,510
it works and since it's all for fast

00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:53,329
userland application is just really cool

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:55,430
so I'm running example that PL don't use

00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:57,709
this finance moment application for

00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,239
anything serious it's a pro module I

00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:00,799
wrote and probably about a week so

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,250
you're having all sorts of interesting

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,609
issues regardless it does work a sort of

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:11,380
the main takeaway there if you want to

00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:14,889
install termites and play around further

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:20,930
SSH an HTTP are not on standard ports

00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:23,210
basically they assume that port 22 is

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:27,470
going to be used so they had 8,000 to

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:32,780
everything so by bazan 8080

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:35,360
SSH is on 8022 and you also need to set

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:38,930
the username for the default user which

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,250
by default is just blank because for

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,830
what I recently didn't think people are

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:45,560
going to be SS aging into it so you

00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:48,290
actually have to use this password to

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,290
set the password and then I key you'll

00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:54,070
get a random username that's sort of

00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:56,600
like the user that you're running the

00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,120
application as you can actually get root

00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,350
access a bunch of little gosh is here

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,150
and there nothing too terrible oh and if

00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,180
you really want to you can run a static

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:10,220
web page from your cell phone that's

00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,750
accessible over the Internet

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:20,900
if you install the web server dark

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:25,400
hd-dvd that is basically AC command like

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:27,020
a C phase web server and like 50 lines

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,960
of code or something crazy like that

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:34,610
what could possibly go wrong if you make

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,330
done a www directory fraida index.html

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,350
file

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:43,640
you do know how dark it could be www

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:45,560
slash & ampersand though that will send

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,390
to the default output to you know help

00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:51,680
that out and it will go into the

00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:54,370
background process then you can do a SSH

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:58,970
port forwarding to a host culture vo

00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:02,740
which will allow you to host the port

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:07,610
how close to the webserver the Arabic so

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:09,890
you do SSH that command there and you

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,140
can then start reserving the basic HTTP

00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,990
web pages from your web server now as

00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:18,290
long as that SSH connection is up he'll

00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:21,380
work so we'll have been nice to have

00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:24,410
installed something that I could run CGI

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,890
bin directory type applications uh so it

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:30,919
could be fun oh I wasn't able to do that

00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:34,550
because of give their permission issues

00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:39,250
or I tried to get like httpd to work

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,250
that ended up having a

00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:46,000
think it was a user permission error

00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:48,530
regardless still a fun toy to play with

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,240
so that's my presentation I hope

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:55,480
everyone liked it MLB I'm the cat here

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,480
