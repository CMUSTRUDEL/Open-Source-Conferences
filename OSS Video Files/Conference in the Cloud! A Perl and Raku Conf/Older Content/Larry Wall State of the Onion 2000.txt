and now I will clear out of the way well

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:29,900
the one and the only

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:32,550
Larry wool I can do that too well

00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,719
actually today I'll need all the support

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,210
I can get

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,120
I'm running an experiment today in sleep

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,710
deprivation actually I've been running

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,200
experiments leap separation for the last

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,450
six months or so if what I say today

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,829
comes out like total mush well you can

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,989
just assume that I used up all my

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,309
pitiful supply of good writing for that

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,120
little book some of you have been

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:56,730
carrying around I decided to talk about

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,739
music this year because I talked about

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,050
chemistry last year the two are

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,559
naturally associated in my brain for

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,880
some reason of course always it can be

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,290
viewed as better living through

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,560
chemistry brain chemistry that is here

00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:26,910
have some neurotransmitters

00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:33,070
[Music]

00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:34,840
you'll have here this talk will mostly

00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:38,490
be auditory but three people who are

00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:42,070
visually visually oriented I have a stop

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:45,580
here are if we get this screen up there

00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:48,390
I have some new tokens that we'll be

00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,390
adding to Pearl

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,210
actually these are some of the Unicode

00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:03,399
characters that are in the process of

00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:09,160
being approved up in the surrogate area

00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:10,929
but you know utf-8 can handle that no I

00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,910
can't wait so I can open both some of

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:18,069
these as operators so now I'm not

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,280
entirely sure what dollar a trill dollar

00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:24,459
B would mean but it'll it'll do

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,260
something to your neurotransmitters the

00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,840
neurotransmitters decide chemistry and

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,080
music are also associated in my mind

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,450
because although I eventually graduated

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,709
in computers and linguistics for my

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,540
first two years in college I was

00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:40,299
pursuing a double major in chemistry and

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,160
music and kind of story of my life that

00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:45,459
I've always been interested in too many

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,630
things jack of all trades and master of

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:51,519
maybe one anyway I voted that phrase

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:55,209
chemistry and music so often that it's

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,069
almost a Pavlovian response hey Larry

00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,900
you talked about chemistry last year

00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,200
what are you going to talk about this

00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,200
year

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,760
slobber slobber slobber I'll talk about

00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:14,140
music hmm it wasn't until three days ago

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,269
though that I actually sat down and

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,319
asked my left brain why do you want to

00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:21,040
talk about music this year

00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:26,739
uh I don't know ask my right brain I am

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:29,319
your right brain stupid um I think part

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:32,170
of the answer is that I worry about how

00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:34,299
Pro culture is going to grow up you know

00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,120
if any of you have kids you know that

00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:40,269
kids are complex and they get more

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,709
complex as they get older fortunately

00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:44,410
there's only so much complexities that

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,870
any one kid can hold and you know they

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:50,040
eventually go insane or if you're really

00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:52,299
lucky they go sane and even so

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,510
understanding any individual completely

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,849
is impossible the pearl culture is

00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,040
composed of many people and so the

00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:02,530
complexity of pearl culture can grow

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,230
without bound no one person can

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,819
understand thrille culture completely if

00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,530
the complexity of pearl culture is going

00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:12,519
to continue to grow beyond the ability

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:14,079
of any one person to fathom you mean how

00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,799
can we continue to think constructively

00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:19,630
about it I believe that we must learn to

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,070
apply constructive analogies from other

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,470
systems that are too complicated to

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,570
understand completely on the one hand we

00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,039
can pull complex ideas from those

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,990
scientists that have had to deal with

00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:31,840
overwhelming complexity such as

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:34,860
chemistry biology neurophysiology so on

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,360
on the other hand the more humanistic

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,400
pursuits have always been overcome by

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,849
complexity whether you're talking about

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,320
sociology or political science you can

00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,820
study literature all your life and not

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,300
even read everything you're supposed to

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,700
read let alone what you want to read

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,200
music is the same way many of us know

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,169
thousands of songs they're musical

00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,520
pieces but nobody can know them all even

00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:58,630
if you could somehow combine all the

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,430
songs that are currently playing

00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,780
somewhere in the world it would just

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,780
come out as pink noise

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,990
[Applause]

00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:22,130
terribly musical and that's exactly how

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:27,440
your brain feels if you've read too many

00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:28,970
thrilled mailing lists all at once only

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,290
God can hear all the songs that are

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,940
being played simultaneously

00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,950
and only God can read all the

00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,500
simultaneous mailing lists news groups

00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,820
and websites of the world

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:44,570
pretty soon only God will be able to

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:45,200
understand the Sipan as humans we have

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,140
to simplify

00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,240
in fact we must oversimplify we all

00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,680
specialized we can focus in on one style

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,930
of music or on a particular piece of

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,350
music or a particular instrument we can

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:59,900
focus on rhythm or harmony or melody we

00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,700
can focus on any of the ways that music

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,350
affects our moods whether it's tied

00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,670
directly to words or subtly is

00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,310
background music to the movie or

00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:10,250
background music in an elevator we can

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,070
focus on any of who what where why when

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,500
or how on a good day we can focus on

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,540
several things but we can never focus on

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,790
all of them so for the rest this talk

00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,200
I'd like to oversimplify girl culture by

00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,450
looking at it through the lens of music

00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,580
culture now the fun with music culture

00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,710
is of course that although it makes a

00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,620
nice analogy it's also too complicated

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:34,310
to talk about or even think about so I

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:37,070
brought along a few props you can think

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,070
of them as extension modules extension

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,840
modules come in all shapes and sizes of

00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,700
course you can program without extension

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,110
module those of you who have evolve far

00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,400
enough to have opposable thumbs and

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,400
results in percussion instrument

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,460
okay that's the snap of course no with a

00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,010
little work you can develop a crackle

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,220
and pop as well to do the crackle you

00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:08,370
first learned to snap twice what you can

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:10,870
and then you combine them in sequence

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,670
okay that's your crackle they do a pop

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:17,950
you just make a little resonant cavity

00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:30,900
with you one hand they go something like

00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:36,820
that and like that

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:38,880
[Applause]

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,410
long ago it I can't fire far away

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,790
somebody discovered that pigs have

00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:48,370
spareribs at least their spare after all

00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:59,760
the meat is gone well at least the pig

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:59,760
doesn't need them anymore not yet

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:16,250
now if you work these just right you can

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,780
you can get a kind of a triple rhythm

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,780
you know they say it's all in the wrist

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,560
well I'm gonna have to bone up on that

00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,539
[Music]

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:50,680
here's the more intuitive interface

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,680
these are called bobbies

00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,770
at least these would be called coffees

00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:05,660
if they were from Spain but they're not

00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,570
they're from Papua New Guinea and so I

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,340
have no idea what they're called there

00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,690
I've asked various people from Papua New

00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,970
Guinea what they're called and they have

00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,980
no idea either yeah they're probably

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,150
called about 750 different things since

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,010
that's about how many languages there

00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,420
are in the ginning every time you go

00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,370
over a hill the next tribe speaks an

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,230
entirely different language it's like

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,790
being in your typical computer science

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,720
department where every professor wants

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,640
you to learn their favorite computer

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,920
language which is different from the

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:36,110
other 750 favorite computer languages

00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:40,310
while the other professors I suppose you

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:42,620
can think of these as a possible six so

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:46,460
in the history of our species has easily

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:48,860
been imposed to crania eventually our

00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,170
ancestors got tired of grilled spareribs

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,260
so they figured out how to boil pigs not

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,080
long after that they discovered soup and

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,700
not long upset they invented the spoon

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,130
so now what technology was developing

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,390
really fast back then anyway shortly

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,190
after they invented the spoon they

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,850
invented two spoons because that way

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,850
they didn't have to share

00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,280
now this module is actually rather

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:32,210
awkward to use kind of like a pearl or

00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:35,020
module that's the same sort of well no I

00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,020
got a third thing

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,519
here's the Fertile high version of the

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,519
same module

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,180
[Music]

00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:01,070
okay

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,070
I'm going to move it over

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,140
we have the technology

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:35,620
we don't need the technology now we're

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:35,620
missing the technology in okay

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:47,550
okay back to our regularly scheduled

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,860
program this you know it's same sort of

00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,840
noise you get when two people butt heads

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:54,210
against each other in row five quarters

00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,070
you know Wow

00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:59,340
that's what oppositional behavior sounds

00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,960
like the entire field of percussion is

00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,940
based on oppositional behavior that is

00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,300
two objects trying to occupy the same

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:09,570
space at the same time so this is

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,950
definitely an object oriented module you

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:14,010
notice the relationship between these

00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,480
two spoons have been encapsulated so

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:19,080
that these are no longer has to specify

00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,380
it explicitly and actually this is the

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,460
second version of this module

00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:30,390
unfortunately one of my kids broke the

00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:33,330
encapsulation on the first version but

00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:40,310
in fact all all of percussion

00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:40,310
instruments are object reason

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:55,540
yeah what the fun percussion instruments

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,800
is our object earrings as I said after

00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,190
all they they indicate the rhythm right

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,060
and rhythm is object-oriented it looks

00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,370
like you don't believe me

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,720
rhythm really really is object-oriented

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:15,910
surely you've all heard of the rhythm

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:17,589
method furthermore you know that people

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,240
who use the rhythm method are frequently

00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:23,880
members of Lamaze class

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:27,009
[Laughter]

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,009
[Music]

00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:47,020
personally I've been through three

00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:48,730
mallomars classes so it's my wife now

00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,370
many of you know that we have four kids

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:54,130
for our fourth kid they told us not to

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,420
come back this it was obvious we already

00:13:54,130 --> 00:14:00,520
knew all there was to know about heavy

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:01,990
breathing actually the Lamaze techniques

00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,460
are an interesting application of rhythm

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,380
for the purpose of distracting the

00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,560
participants with pantings of various

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,960
sorts okay honey now do sixes twos

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,820
threes sevens and fives not necessarily

00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:17,230
in that order

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:18,790
nurse take my husband please in the

00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,420
abstract rhythm is about unit

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,110
programming

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:31,240
kind of like a Geiger counter here's our

00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:35,160
current background radiation here's a

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,160
few close to the TV in your hotel room

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:45,070
those of you who know Morse code

00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:46,270
probably know what that said I don't if

00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,230
you don't care to sit too close to your

00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:53,950
TV just move the boulder or or stay here

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:59,890
and wait for the Galois Kenyon reactor

00:14:53,950 --> 00:15:01,330
to melt down random events aren't really

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,800
all that interesting however it gets

00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:05,580
more interesting when you program which

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,580
events happen win

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:26,780
ya know I learn little games like that

00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,870
there's there's really only one sound

00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:32,720
that students can make the conga drums

00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:35,420
by contrast provide a richer interface

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,760
you can think of the interfaces

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,760
parameterised in several different

00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:44,870
dimensions most of which are infinitely

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:48,350
variable but for all richness is still

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:51,770
an event-driven module girl also has an

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,960
event module and it's maybe a little

00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,120
more portable than these but you could

00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,250
use a little more work on that but you

00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:10,670
can do some various interesting event

00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:12,740
loops on these things now as a linguist

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,170
trained in technics I tend to think of

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:21,050
these things in terms of feels waves and

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:25,280
particles the harmony harmony is harmony

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:27,260
as I feel while melody is a wave I think

00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,600
the rhythm is particles where the events

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,790
are the points at which things happen

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,440
actually it's the events themselves that

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,780
are particles the rhythm itself is the

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,930
higher level of abstraction sort of

00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,460
connecting the dots in our heads so

00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,710
event questions start with with when

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,950
while rhythm questions tend to start

00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:54,260
with how often like how often should we

00:16:45,950 --> 00:17:01,540
have a Perl conference how often should

00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:09,410
we have a Perl world cruise actually

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:12,050
it's like this three against two rhythm

00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,550
sort of a hemiola as they throw

00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,560
conferences once the year while the Perl

00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:17,780
food is scheduled to be once every 18

00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,980
months which gives you three beats in

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,990
one hand to every two beats and the

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,740
other here's three because here's three

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,740
defeats against four

00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:36,210
there's three guests five if you want to

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,790
figure these out for yourself it's

00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,780
really just a bit of math multiply these

00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,610
two numbers to find out how many

00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,380
subdivisions you need with three against

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,190
four you need both subdivisions and with

00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:49,320
three against 515 you just try it out

00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:52,260
now in reality there is no Perl cultures

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,120
is more of a fractal with many smaller

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:59,160
interactions for all the larger ones you

00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:01,140
know here's a Perl conference all sorts

00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,559
of stuff going on in the interest

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,790
disease but uh speaking of fractals I

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,460
noticed an interesting thing about the

00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,320
rhythm of releases as the size of the

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,720
Perl core and libraries gets bigger it

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,270
takes longer to rev a major release so

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:31,200
they naturally get slower

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:35,610
row one don't do Row three lower then we

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,470
get some sub versions they get lower in

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,410
Florida eventually the the subversion

00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,730
they're taking as long as the the

00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,809
original Perl one pearl two thing but

00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:48,840
that's because they're actually

00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:49,890
accomplishing just as much anyway that's

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:58,650
just I just thought that was interesting

00:18:49,890 --> 00:19:00,299
in compensation of now up so now we've

00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,730
seen instruments that specialize in

00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:05,070
rhythm which is a particle effect in

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,679
contrast there are other instruments

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:11,540
that specialize in harmony and melody

00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:11,540
here is an auto heart

00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:39,700
yeah you know it's always on the wrong

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:47,110
side harmony it's almost a pure harmony

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:53,710
instrument with a little bit of rhythm

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:56,260
on the strum level but harmony is is an

00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,070
abstraction a construct we manufacture

00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,380
in our own mind

00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:02,200
unlike rhythm harmony is spread out in

00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:05,050
the pitch dimension and behaves as a

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,940
field by that I mean it seems to fill

00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:09,160
space in a way that neither rhythm nor

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,110
melody does you can play rhythms and

00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,440
melodies simultaneously and they tend to

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,520
keep their individual identities but if

00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,750
you try playing two courts

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,340
simultaneously you either get a

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,470
different chord from either of them or

00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:23,050
you just get mush

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:24,850
interesting well you can't actually add

00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:27,190
two chords together on an autoharp

00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,140
because another heart builds harmony

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:31,240
harmonies by subtraction not by addition

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,130
you know it's like trying to mix paints

00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,429
when your ought to be mixing life the

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:42,640
more you try to mix less you end up with

00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:45,280
two uh so we subtract the most to get

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,460
the what we want we subtract we get

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,640
fewer and fewer notes eventually we get

00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:54,700
no no that's not the way to make harmony

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:58,920
to actually mix harmony you you need an

00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,920
additive device like a keyboard

00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,720
[Music]

00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:13,159
like that something else again talk

00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:16,490
about a lot about harmony and pearl

00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,620
culture actually we yell at each other a

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:21,850
lot about harmony and real culture but

00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:24,169
but it's very harmonious yelling

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:26,899
remember that harmony tends to

00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:28,549
monopolize your mental space but that's

00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:30,440
kind of an illusion it's easy when you

00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:31,789
hear two people arguing in a public

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,380
forum to think that the entire folk

00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:34,909
forum is bogus but if you look carefully

00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,850
there's usually still background of

00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:39,380
non-fighting going on as well nor do

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,330
people fight all the time it just seems

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:45,080
that way we try to fit too many notes

00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:46,700
into the same mental space but you don't

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,880
actually have to harmonize every note

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,710
everywhere all at once we have different

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,260
locations different chords can happen

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,419
happen in different places different

00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,370
pieces have different standards for

00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:00,200
dissonance and that's fine you know

00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,510
maybe it pearl friends mailing lists

00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,149
would be like Mozart and come flying

00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:07,429
chrome this is like Schoenberg because

00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:08,559
with John Cage with Metallica thrown in

00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:11,720
for good measure

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,970
oh five quarters this is slightly more

00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,679
civilized it's a bit like Lake mälar

00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,210
where a part of the time the music has a

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,710
tonal and tortured and the rest of the

00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:23,179
time the music is tonal let's go

00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:25,669
portrait actually I like Mahler an awful

00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:28,010
lot he's my favorite composer and

00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:29,870
there's no conduct coincidence uh Mahler

00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,840
once said he always tried to put the

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,100
whole world into each of his symphonies

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,580
know also that my favorite authors

00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:40,880
Tolkien who also put a entire world into

00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,470
his work so perhaps this kind of natural

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,710
that I tried to hook up the entire work

00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,419
world the Pearl one way or another

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,190
of course you can't have the whole world

00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:53,149
in one spot without accepting of certain

00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:57,320
modes isn't it there's another form of

00:22:53,149 --> 00:22:58,909
abstraction which we call melody in some

00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,919
ways it's most mysterious because in

00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:03,919
fact it really is object-oriented in a

00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:07,880
deep way a melody is a sequence of notes

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:10,220
that weeks that we perceive to have been

00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,440
played or performed by a single object

00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:15,529
which we often call a voice even if it

00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,880
isn't one object permanence is something

00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:19,310
we learn at a young age

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,870
that's why we play peekaboo to figure

00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:23,270
out that mommy didn't actually disappear

00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:25,520
when she went behind the towel similarly

00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:28,010
you can take temporarily separate notes

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,590
and creatively imagine that they came

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:32,990
from the same instrument now how many of

00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:37,820
you have ever played the computer game

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:39,110
the seventh yes some of you okay you may

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,060
recognize this melody which is

00:23:39,110 --> 00:24:05,960
permanently burned into my personally

00:23:41,060 --> 00:24:09,890
problem and then you solve that

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:16,460
particular puzzle I hope I didn't give

00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:17,300
any way that game intentionally makes it

00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,010
really hard to follow

00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,830
melody since it treats the notes as

00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,810
discrete but some instruments make it

00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:27,340
really easy to follow a melody by by

00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,340
making the transitions continuous

00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,520
[Music]

00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,710
[Music]

00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:57,810
life is always interesting isn't it

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,520
okay wonder how you play with me so you

00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:01,680
need a double inflection point

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,210
a double inflection here or double curve

00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:26,370
and you find the inflection point in the

00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:28,700
middle maybe try for mary had a little

00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,700
lamb

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,670
[Music]

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,150
[Music]

00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:56,529
[Applause]

00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:58,299
Wow something every day hmm

00:25:56,529 --> 00:26:00,759
now I don't know who first came up with

00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:03,359
the idea of playing it saw it it's not

00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:05,739
what you call obvious on the other hand

00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,269
some things are so obvious that if one

00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:22,269
person didn't invent it the next person

00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:23,950
would for example with wing another

00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:33,359
rather obvious invention I think is

00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:33,359
bottle Harry a works really great for

00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,359
WC Fields one says I'd rather have a

00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:41,019
bottle in front of me than a frontal

00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:42,309
lobotomy actually a bottle in front of

00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:44,619
you doesn't have a lot to recommend it

00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:47,909
either in particular the melodies you

00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:50,940
can play with the module or rather

00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:53,229
monotonic not to mention monotonous

00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,440
here's the William Tell Overture on the

00:26:53,229 --> 00:27:02,880
bottle

00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:02,880
[Laughter]

00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,610
otherwise mister miss can at least vary

00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,980
the pitch parameter but most windows

00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,780
permits are by nature melodic and that

00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,600
they can only produce one single note at

00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:18,730
a time start there are exceptions of

00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:24,220
course take the bagpipes

00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:28,390
please I don't think the bagpipes are an

00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,950
obvious interface either I don't know

00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:33,850
whether playing your hands would be

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:35,140
considered obvious or not I don't know

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:40,720
why but you have to wet your whistle to

00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:42,750
do this doesn't make this thing I I

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,220
discovered that one by accident myself

00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,720
one day I was leaning on a table with my

00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,250
hands folded and I just happened to blow

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:56,590
in my hand so maybe warm them or

00:27:48,250 --> 00:28:01,350
something well it's actually the hard

00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:06,550
way you see with the fingers enter

00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:08,410
interlace yeah now but this actually is

00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:10,810
illustrates a very important musical

00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:13,210
technique one of the one that many of us

00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:16,330
have had to learn repeatedly oddly this

00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:18,070
technique is called unlearning it's like

00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,410
backtrack you learn well in real life

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,210
sometimes you have to make negative

00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,400
progress in order to go forward in the

00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,080
long run for instance when I started

00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,240
taking private lessons on the violin I

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,610
had to unlearn unlearn that years worth

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,440
of bad habits I picked up in school now

00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,790
in the case of playing my hands I had

00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,400
learned my hold my hands a different way

00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:38,260
if I wanted to have greater pitch range

00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,260
so once I did we learned how to play my

00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,550
hands I could get almost an octave that

00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,690
leads off the star-spangled banner' but

00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,650
you know there's lots of melodies

00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,650
that'll fit into an octave

00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:05,580
I don't have that octave a little bit

00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,309
[Music]

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:22,150
which is of course how much is that

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,890
camel in the window of course you can do

00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,140
much much the same thing with with an

00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:31,419
extension mechanism whether that's

00:29:26,140 --> 00:30:00,640
official you know they want to play the

00:29:31,419 --> 00:30:15,789
box thank you

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:19,960
this is my wife obviously that's my main

00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:23,320
instrument and certainly one of the most

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,750
obvious witness this is your voice this

00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,720
we certainly produce a lot of wins with

00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:31,590
our voice but I know I'm not going to

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,880
sing anything operatic for you and

00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:40,179
although I'm preaching to the choir I'm

00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:43,380
not going to make you sing either that

00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:43,380
should play something on my computer

00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,690
we have ways to make you talk

00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:15,320
hey yeah I know I'm a sound engineer in

00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:17,360
my church I'm allowed to do that anyway

00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,580
how about you'll recall that melody is

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,350
is an abstraction of object permanence

00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,299
as I missed earlier is this to install

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,740
such an object a voice whether it's

00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,179
really a human voice or any of the other

00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,280
instruments but the really interesting

00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:30,620
thing to me is the relationship of

00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,780
melody to harmony and it has to do with

00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:42,830
what we call voice leading here the

00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:45,160
guitar yep that's a guitar I need to be

00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,160
stickier

00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm picky you can play in a guitar in

00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:53,100
many styles but the most notable feature

00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,020
of the guitars is how much is used for

00:31:53,100 --> 00:32:13,580
harmony rather than melody regardless of

00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:37,930
the style - here's the

00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:37,930
[Music]

00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:44,560
plus if you're a classical of tourists

00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:46,330
you do a lot of melody too but the the

00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,770
very basis of harmony is all the little

00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,780
melodies going on in the middle of the

00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:51,250
courts and you can actually hear the

00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:57,060
little ways in there if you if you

00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:57,060
listen here's a chord change

00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,650
[Music]

00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:07,360
so here's things like just happening in

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:11,140
the middle in things like that little

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:13,840
voices and so the harmony is actually on

00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:16,440
a reductionist in a reductionist fashion

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,120
it's just a bunch of little harmony

00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,160
holistically no of these but

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:26,950
holistically it you don't perceive it

00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:29,650
that way it's perceived as a feel no so

00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:32,790
so you don't do wrong we hear chords you

00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:34,350
don't actually hear individual notes

00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:39,590
into it the whole

00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:43,590
[Music]

00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:47,000
whatever it is you ever notice that

00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:49,050
music is sometimes hard to talk about I

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,910
never had any trouble talking about

00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:55,200
parole anyway the bottom bottom note of

00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,910
a chord is kind of in a privileged

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,440
position it behaves more like a melody

00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,540
of its own but it's the funny kind of

00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,760
knowing even in the proceed to drive the

00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,410
rhythm and the harmony if you take the

00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,540
bottom four strings of a guitar and drop

00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:08,540
them in octaves you get one of these

00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:17,419
yeah

00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:25,909
now to get this well right here ready

00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:42,510
[Music]

00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:44,639
now some of you will think that that's

00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:49,049
mission impossible that's actually a Man

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:55,829
From UNCLE which was my favorite show

00:34:49,049 --> 00:35:09,119
when I was open channel D but here's

00:34:55,829 --> 00:35:14,150
Mission Impossible okay bass guitar is

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:17,099
really fun even if you're not good at it

00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:19,230
hmm sometimes I think I'm the bass

00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:22,500
guitarist at Perl culture now I play the

00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:23,790
strange nobody and then a whole bunch of

00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,660
other people start playing these strange

00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:28,680
rhythms and harmonies around me but now

00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,980
we're going to go back to hitting things

00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,980
again

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,500
[Music]

00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,830
this is what is known as they hammer

00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:52,560
donor it actually belongs to my wife

00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:59,730
Mike because he lets me borrow her

00:35:52,560 --> 00:36:03,000
things in it

00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:05,520
the one thing that about this that you

00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,560
know is this harder on other instruments

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,000
especially when this room is actually a

00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,710
multi-threaded if the beatings of

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,369
multi-threading it has two separate

00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,369
threads of control

00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:21,210
see what so I play okay

00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:43,520
nope

00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:49,270
[Music]

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:49,270
[Applause]

00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:56,220
it rained all night the day I left the

00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,119
weather it was dry got so hot I froze to

00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,250
death due down

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,200
Susanna don't you cry musicians delight

00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,030
in contradictions but so do language

00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,350
designers and you have to be able to see

00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,900
both sides of every question when you

00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:09,960
design a language it helps to have the

00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,000
multiple personality disorder

00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,740
it also helps have a a multi-threaded

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,740
interface like like piano

00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:39,720
you know piano is just a fancier

00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:42,420
interface for a dulcimer in a way it

00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,450
still has hammers the real Canada they

00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,280
go out and strike the strings and you

00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:50,220
know another form of oppositional

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,320
behavior but it's professional

00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,349
instrument in other words but it happens

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,580
to have a pitcher parameter as well it

00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:58,740
also has a more developed

00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:04,950
multi-threading model it supports up to

00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:06,630
10 threads in two groups of 5 advanced

00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:12,900
implementations can handle 20 threads

00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:14,430
that requires two CPUs you know I'm

00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,340
afraid the piano module must still be

00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:20,540
considered experimental know the

00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,540
interface is somewhat user friendly

00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:36,690
cetera um now I don't actually have time

00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:38,190
to talk about counterpoint except to say

00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:40,440
this simple to illustrates to

00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:43,140
contrapuntal principles we see in the

00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,510
purl community a contrary motion and

00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,130
parallel motion contrary motion is when

00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:50,359
you have two programmers or those

00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:50,359
melodies going in opposite directions

00:38:54,650 --> 00:39:00,230
parallel motion is when the programmers

00:38:56,789 --> 00:39:00,230
agree on how to get where they're going

00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:08,160
actually I talked about the being

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,690
experimental but the piano interface is

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,080
actually one of the most standard

00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:15,330
interfaces we have unfortunately organs

00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,700
are not so standard once you get away

00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:19,770
from the keyboard itself how you set one

00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:23,099
particular stop it really depends on the

00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:25,280
kind of organ you have in pipe organs

00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:29,550
you might pull out one of the stop

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,619
puller routers on a Hammond organ you

00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:48,060
might just adjust the drawbar on this

00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:50,070
organ I pushed d-35 gotta love Bach next

00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:52,880
time someone says pearls Baroque thank

00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,880
them for the compliment

00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:12,570
[Music]

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,019
they say it's easy to get a composer out

00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:33,969
of bed in the morning all you have to do

00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:35,920
is go over to the piano or the organ in

00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:37,449
this case and play an unresolved chord

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,849
then they have to get out of debt and

00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:45,239
resolve the story all right I can't

00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:45,239
stand it

00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:53,389
[Music]

00:40:55,799 --> 00:41:00,670
now I promised I'd bring my violin and

00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:02,199
as you can see I didn't break my arm in

00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:06,189
Aikido so I guess I'll have to play us

00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:09,789
some the violin is one of those you know

00:41:06,189 --> 00:41:11,739
traditional standard instruments as I

00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:15,459
say nobody ever got fired for buying a

00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:17,690
symphony orchestra but if you do get

00:41:15,459 --> 00:41:23,949
fired your orchestra can play for you

00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:23,949
[Music]

00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:34,720
pretty sad happy music - you know violin

00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:36,420
is actually two different instruments

00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,970
and I actually brought it here to

00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:41,260
illustrate polymorphism people ask

00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:43,480
what's the difference between a violin

00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:45,220
and a fiddle there there's no difference

00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,309
really it only depends on which class do

00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:52,349
you call the method from here's the

00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:52,349
fiddle interface choke up on the bow

00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,500
[Music]

00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,869
[Music]

00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,019
[Music]

00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:41,419
[Music]

00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,350
[Applause]

00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:47,429
[Music]

00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:47,429
[Applause]

00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:53,109
funny how people who claim to become

00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,690
deaf can nonetheless recognize various

00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:57,730
style of music when they hear them our

00:42:55,690 --> 00:43:00,670
parametric capabilities are usually much

00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:03,910
better than we admit that girl's design

00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:07,890
thanks off that that last a little bit

00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:07,890
of music actually can stand on its own

00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:16,319
usually known as shave and a haircut two

00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:16,319
bit so music also has its one-liners

00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:31,150
here's another here's another piece

00:43:19,089 --> 00:43:32,650
known as the mousetrap concerto actually

00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:36,250
I've played a lot of curious music in my

00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:37,630
on my violin it was um I fairly to spend

00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,130
six years in the Seattle Youth Symphony

00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:40,809
under the direction of vilem suckle

00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,069
there wasn't anything we couldn't play

00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:45,180
but we just had to work at it a little

00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:49,079
longer than a freshman orchestra would

00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:50,980
reminds me a girl development sometimes

00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:52,390
one thing I learned while playing is

00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:54,970
various orchestra is these the

00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:56,380
importance of faking it you have to be

00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:59,529
able to fake playing in this room before

00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:03,099
you can really play it I'm faking most

00:43:59,529 --> 00:44:04,690
of these instruments my whole first year

00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:06,190
in the Youth Symphony I was petrified

00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:07,930
that I might get called off on during

00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:09,940
rehearsal to play a part that I wasn't

00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:12,130
ready to play fortunately I was never

00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:14,410
called upon my second year I made a

00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:17,230
startling discovery I just learned the

00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:18,519
the music thoroughly and then I didn't

00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:21,940
have to worry about whether anybody I

00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:24,430
called on me to play it now how does

00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,750
this play out in thrill culture well we

00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,349
have to be willing to let people take it

00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,390
for a while

00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:31,750
if Terrell is getting their job done and

00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:33,339
that's fine but we also have to find

00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,509
ways of encouraging people to upgrade

00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:36,579
their abilities when they're ready for

00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:38,859
that step and we don't do that by

00:44:36,579 --> 00:44:40,869
beating them over the head we do it by

00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:47,230
showing the positive benefits of

00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:48,519
learning parole for real now it probably

00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:51,250
could have actually been a professional

00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:52,809
violinist hand in height I've been only

00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:55,329
interested in music I might have been

00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:58,630
but then I wouldn't be up here waving

00:44:55,329 --> 00:45:01,100
around a violin around that you

00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:13,190
so I said I don't like to use this file

00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:15,290
into illustrate usability something like

00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:16,490
that well you know I don't think William

00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:18,350
Tell would have minded the Lone Ranger

00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:19,310
using his music but when I was growing

00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:20,810
up there were still cigarette

00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:22,460
commercials on TV and sometimes you

00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:25,850
heard kinda larks have a lark have a

00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:28,160
lark Tuesday later on it was a tepee 75

00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,750
feet cellar roll I'm sure William toe

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:34,370
would just love to shoot a pizza roll

00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:37,940
off someone's head and finally I'd like

00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:42,530
to finally introduce officially my

00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:50,840
synthesizer here Korg i5s week girl

00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:52,340
hackers real hackers meet Berg yes I'd

00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,990
be pretending it's a piano and an organ

00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:55,040
and any number of other things but it's

00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:58,130
really just a bunch of switches and

00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,830
oscillators and such like Perl it can be

00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:03,909
viewed as AI a tool that got out of hand

00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:03,909
[Music]

00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:10,910
like Perl it can be viewed as just

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,790
another tool in the toolbox as well I

00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:15,470
joked that the piano interface with

00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:17,960
experimental but this interface really

00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:22,910
is experimental keyboard interface is

00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:25,210
pretty standard but less there are

00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:28,220
things now we hope they're better

00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:30,740
nevertheless it's a whole lot of fun to

00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:33,410
use this thing in its current state you

00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:35,120
know kind of like Perl it does a pretty

00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:41,080
good job of emulating some other tools

00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:41,080
in the toolbox for instance

00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:50,589
[Music]

00:46:46,290 --> 00:47:01,500
easier here than there unless you're my

00:46:50,589 --> 00:47:03,580
wife Wow I'm gonna get in trouble I

00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,260
think it's really cool about this

00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:07,060
keyboard is you can it can play various

00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,900
different styles of music you know Jim

00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,730
Tony and all that

00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,500
my favorite button is the one that walks

00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:14,050
in the different styles in the same

00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,670
tempo so that you can go from one style

00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:17,440
to another and see how the same tune

00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:20,830
sounds in different cultural contexts

00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:23,440
for example how would Pachelbel's Canon

00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:27,820
come out were played by Mick and Keith

00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:41,080
or by John Paul George and Ringo or by

00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:43,740
Elvis well we can find out the tempo

00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,740
right here

00:47:47,170 --> 00:48:02,670
[Music]

00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:03,280
start this again

00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:03,820
[Music]

00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:29,849
[Applause]

00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:29,849
[Music]

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:50,080
[Music]

00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:50,080
I know what I did wrong

00:48:51,310 --> 00:49:03,429
no back to the king

00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:03,429
[Music]

00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:44,209
[Music]

00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:57,839
yeah well you know one could go on all

00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:59,250
day with that but or that one of the

00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,720
things we love about Pearl is that it

00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:02,849
supports many different styles of

00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,430
programming now that's something we

00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:07,500
never want to lose with Perl there's

00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:09,630
also just the the interest to joy in

00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,220
making music that has nothing to do with

00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,970
whether we're using the music for some

00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,310
other purpose

00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:15,750
likewise there's an intrinsic joy and

00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:17,070
programming in Perl that has nothing to

00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,230
do with the purpose we're putting it to

00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:21,990
that is also something we never want to

00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:24,570
lose in fact there are many features we

00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:26,910
want to conserve in Perl but music is

00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:30,780
continually reinventing itself and so is

00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:34,380
Perl culture most music is evolutionary

00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:37,560
not revolutionary people don't usually

00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:39,119
write it over new music service keys

00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,150
right uh spring being the exception the

00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:45,109
rules the rule but people don't usually

00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:47,550
write it over new perl modules either

00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:49,109
but occasionally there does come a time

00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:51,180
we have to think like revolutionaries

00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:52,190
someone has to throw the tea into the

00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,780
Boston Harbor

00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:57,060
someone has to decide that it was time

00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,920
to write a document starting out when in

00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:02,130
the course of human events it becomes

00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,630
necessary etc etc but before that

00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:08,099
someone had to decide to alter the

00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:10,170
course of human events yesterday a bunch

00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:13,230
of us radicals decided it was time to

00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:15,690
alter the course of human events some of

00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:17,250
you may have heard rumors of this so

00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:19,770
today I'd like to announce to the world

00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:22,550
that the effort to write Perl 6 has

00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:22,550
begun in earnest

00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:34,099
[Applause]

00:51:31,299 --> 00:51:36,770
and I'd like to use the synthesizer to

00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:38,450
make an important point if you

00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:39,890
manufacture something like this we

00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:42,440
eventually come to a point where you say

00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:45,260
this is a really neat gizmo but we can

00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:46,700
do something better do we continue to

00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,859
make small improvements in the current

00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:50,569
design or did you redesign the interface

00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:53,809
to let us do what we really like to do

00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:56,059
down the road and if we do a redesign

00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:58,099
can we keep everything people liked

00:51:56,059 --> 00:51:59,150
about the old design while getting rid

00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:02,119
of all the things people don't like

00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:04,460
about the thing they have right now

00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:07,400
well that's kind of the state pearl is

00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:10,369
in right now we really really like what

00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,079
we have we like it a lot but we can

00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:15,380
think of lots of ways we can do it

00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:17,960
better and the things we'd like to do

00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:20,299
better come in several categories first

00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:26,059
the language itself could use some

00:52:20,299 --> 00:52:27,740
revision I'm allowed to admit that there

00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,849
are many historical works on pearl that

00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,720
wouldn't have been there if I'd known

00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:32,990
what I was doing

00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:34,819
but hey I was faking it back then you

00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:37,460
didn't know that did you

00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:38,869
I'm more of a competent language

00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,289
designer than I was thirteen years ago

00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:43,970
and I have a lot more help these days

00:52:41,289 --> 00:52:45,890
plus it's time to steal all the good

00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:49,609
ideas we can from those other languages

00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:52,130
that developed in the last decade one of

00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:53,359
the things I realized yesterday was that

00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:57,289
we're actually in a much better position

00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:59,539
than when I designed 4:05 nowadays we

00:52:57,289 --> 00:53:01,520
have code backends such as be : : d

00:52:59,539 --> 00:53:03,400
parse they can spit out the Perl code

00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,140
corresponding to the compiled index tree

00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,400
if you think about that it means that it

00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:09,920
would be relatively easy to make it

00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:14,089
spell out a closely related language

00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:16,099
such as Perl 6 Pro has always been

00:53:14,089 --> 00:53:18,049
designed to evolve but now we actually

00:53:16,099 --> 00:53:21,049
have the capability to evolving a little

00:53:18,049 --> 00:53:23,390
faster this means that for the first

00:53:21,049 --> 00:53:25,279
time in history we have the opportunity

00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:27,500
to make something pat about fixed role

00:53:25,279 --> 00:53:30,079
while preserving a migration task for

00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:33,529
the current code and I really couldn't

00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,880
do that when I design Pro 5 we had to

00:53:33,529 --> 00:53:37,490
make almost everything up we're

00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,430
compatible or backward compatible

00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:41,280
whichever one it is but you know really

00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:43,770
now first

00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,330
to make that sort of changes and since

00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,740
it is the first chance it probably is

00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:49,740
also the last chance so I think we

00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:51,270
should of course we are not interested

00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,730
in breaking things just to break things

00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,380
but I'm sure you can think of things you

00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,450
might have done differently myself I

00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,610
really wish I'd made the system call

00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:05,490
return true on success rather than fall

00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:12,450
I wish I had made local time return the

00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:13,980
actual here and not - here - 1900 I'd

00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:17,520
really love to throw a select file

00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:19,560
handle and there's you know there's

00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,870
general consensus that type clubs may

00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:26,250
develop their usefulness and our number

00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,840
is simple but potentially powerful

00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,540
features have already been put on the

00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:32,220
table for consideration that's not going

00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:34,140
that's not to say we're going to do all

00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:36,060
of them my overriding goal for the

00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:38,430
redesign is for a language is that easy

00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:40,680
things should stay easy hard things

00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:45,360
should get easier and impossible things

00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:46,470
should get hard as it were another place

00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,140
we'd like to do better than the

00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:51,780
implementation of the language as

00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:53,400
opposed to the language itself no I I

00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:55,800
think I did a pretty good job with the

00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,140
design of the profile and making it

00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:00,090
extensible with the language level but

00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,890
the internal API is necessary to write

00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:04,770
extension modules could really use to be

00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:06,720
cleaned up some of you may have noticed

00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:09,960
that I mean we could we could scrap that

00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,220
that's for something better and and of

00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,980
course we want the core to be smaller

00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:17,960
and faster always you know I'd like to

00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,960
run palm I'd like to run Perl on my palm

00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:25,300
but perhaps more importantly we could

00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,859
design the extension system so that

00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,210
installing a new version of Perl doesn't

00:55:26,859 --> 00:55:32,079
break all your existing extension

00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:33,609
modules we we have many other ideas for

00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,730
improving the implementation as well and

00:55:33,609 --> 00:55:38,560
these won't come filtering out so these

00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:40,839
are language changes or implementations

00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:44,369
the implementation changes will happen

00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:48,099
unless we also reinvent how we do things

00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:50,500
so we've already started a redesign of

00:55:48,099 --> 00:55:52,119
Perl culture trying to keep the good

00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:55,990
aspects and leaving behind a

00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:59,290
non-productive aspect we intend to

00:55:55,990 --> 00:56:01,089
abandon the Perl 5 porters model of

00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:03,220
development which demonstrative

00:56:01,089 --> 00:56:06,910
demonstrable eat leads to a lot of talk

00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:08,980
of election instead we'll break down the

00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:12,040
design of Perl 6 and the maintenance of

00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:13,450
Perl 5 into manageable tasks given to

00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:17,220
meaningful working groups with

00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:19,780
meaningful charters and meaningful goals

00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:21,700
we have collective really resolved to

00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:23,740
make these working groups work and where

00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:27,339
they do not work to work at making them

00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:29,380
work until they do work we will continue

00:56:27,339 --> 00:56:31,359
to refine all aspects of our development

00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:33,849
model until every itch is scratched as

00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:37,960
efficiently as possible we are really

00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:40,599
jazzed about this it is our belief that

00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:42,730
if Perl culture is designed right Perl

00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:45,790
will be able to evolve into the language

00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:48,430
we need 20 years from now it's also our

00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:49,960
belief that only a radical rethinking of

00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:52,210
both the Perl language and its

00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:54,880
implementation can energize the

00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:56,710
community in the long run where'll in

00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,950
long run means 10 and 20 years down the

00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:02,710
road finally it is our belief that Perl

00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,660
5 itself will be better supported than

00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:07,690
it would be if we merely tried to guard

00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:11,140
what we already have the best defense is

00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:14,589
a good offense now this is not going to

00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:17,800
happen quickly we expect to have alpha

00:57:14,589 --> 00:57:21,310
code a year from now for some definition

00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,990
in alpha we might even ship it but we

00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:26,079
expect it to be well designed alpha code

00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:29,380
in the meantime we're not abandoning

00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:31,420
Perl 5 anytime soon we all like Pro 5 a

00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:33,540
lot we all use it a lot

00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:36,120
many commercial interests

00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:38,010
guarantee that Perl 5 continues to be

00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:41,420
well maintained and stabilized for quite

00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:44,250
a few years to come and we fully expect

00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:45,540
given the history of Perl for that five

00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:50,280
years from now a lot of people will

00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:52,530
still be using Perl 5 we do expect the

00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:55,110
rate of new development in Perl 5 to

00:57:52,530 --> 00:58:00,120
taper off of course and that can be

00:57:55,110 --> 00:58:02,610
viewed as a feature but no open source

00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:04,560
software specifically rejects the get

00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:07,740
big quick philosophy of the typical web

00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:09,090
startup such rapid growth tends to

00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:12,150
fragment the culture and in the long run

00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:14,340
leads to ruin instead we intend to

00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:16,110
proceed at the fastest speed at which we

00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:18,360
can efficiently propagate our cultural

00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:20,880
values to newcomers in our culture but

00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:22,560
no faster this is the healthy way

00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,590
forward and the only way to compete in

00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:28,620
the competitive space we have to be

00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:29,970
better not just observe faster part of

00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:33,510
being better is making sure the

00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:35,310
stragglers don't be left behind we are

00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:38,310
determined to do the right thing by

00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:41,070
everyone so this we pledged Our Lives

00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:47,070
our Fortunes and our sacred honor as it

00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:48,450
were what there isn't it many more

00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:50,250
details to our plans will be coming out

00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:51,240
in the next few days and weeks we'll

00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:55,650
tell you who has taken responsibility

00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:57,810
for what we'll set out a roadmap or a

00:58:55,650 --> 00:59:02,250
chart if you're into music of where we'd

00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:05,100
like to be when look at the wwl org for

00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:07,500
more as time goes on things should be

00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:09,780
showing up there today even right now I

00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,250
would like to call each of you to play

00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:14,100
your part

00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:17,550
whatever that part is you yourselves are

00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:19,650
our individual melodies your being here

00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:20,580
today may be an event that changes the

00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:23,040
course of your tune

00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:24,750
certainly your being here with everyone

00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,790
else who is here today and make the kind

00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:28,500
of harmony a lost chord that will never

00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:31,260
you never be played exactly the same

00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:33,690
again together we perform a a

00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:36,630
contrapuntal jazz improvisation that can

00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:38,820
only be recorded in perfectly music has

00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:40,830
always been an ephemeral art and even

00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:44,190
with CDs and DVDs people still go to

00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:46,800
live concerts so remember you were here

00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:48,570
when a new thing was born

00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,040
every Perl conference is a cool event

00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:52,770
because thrille people are the best

00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:54,810
people in the world in this age of

00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:57,630
mailing list in web pages it's really

00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:59,570
nice to get personally acquainted with

00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:02,340
all the folks who you've met on the net

00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:04,650
but this conference is not just about

01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:06,450
getting together with your buds it's

01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:08,940
also about finding new friends forming

01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:10,920
new bands creating cool new sounds maybe

01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:13,220
leading a record maybe landing a

01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:15,210
recording contract on the c-pen

01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:17,970
sometimes it's about more than that

01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:19,410
today it's about more than that we're

01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:23,010
really serious about reinventing

01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:26,119
everything that needs reinventing way I

01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:30,150
look at it pro/5 with a composition

01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:32,070
largely by a single composer mean it's a

01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:34,080
foreign classical composition but in

01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:36,840
essence is one person's view how to make

01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:38,840
music if you work with Brill five you

01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:41,820
have to follow the score pretty closely

01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:44,580
row six is going to be designed by the

01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:47,280
community we're going to be doing some

01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:48,630
jamming I'll still be exercising some

01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,040
artistic control over the language

01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:52,170
itself but instead of playing off the

01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:54,270
score I'm gonna be playing off charts

01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:56,010
now and you're going to be speaking a

01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:57,660
lot of people improvising melodies of

01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:59,100
their own and interweaving them

01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:01,170
creatively in ways that will make thrill

01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:03,859
sticks much better than 4:05 just as

01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:08,100
Perl 5 was much better than thrilled 4

01:01:03,859 --> 01:01:09,930
and if you know anything about me you

01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:12,810
know I take the promised land quite

01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:15,200
seriously we're all going to march in

01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:15,200
there someday

01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:25,430
[Music]

01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:27,560
[Applause]

01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:28,120
[Music]

01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,320
[Applause]

01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:32,460
[Music]

01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:38,340
[Applause]

01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:38,490
[Music]

01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,580
[Applause]

01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:41,580
[Music]

01:01:44,279 --> 01:01:59,030
I'm down

01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:59,030
[Applause]

01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:08,530
Larry would you be willing to do a Q&A

01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:10,210
no okay I'd like to I'd like to

01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:13,230
introduce our our interim program

01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:13,230
manager for Perl 6

01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,759
no get battle go yeah

01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:51,210
if is pearl sticks going to beat in C++

01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:52,830
maybe maybe maybe not yeah

01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:55,560
you know chip chip has a lot of

01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:59,100
experience with with thinking about Perl

01:02:55,560 --> 01:03:02,360
and C++ and and we intend to use the

01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:02,360
lessons he's learned one way or another

01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:19,020
well it'll come out in stages we are in

01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:24,840
cultural terms we are starting working

01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:27,420
on it already and over the next month or

01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:32,160
so you are going to be the the chart the

01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:35,370
roadmap come out and my own personal

01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:37,440
goal for some reason they they wanted me

01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:40,380
to take the position of a language

01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:43,560
designer of course I'll have a lot of

01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:47,850
help on that but my goal for that part

01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:51,600
of it I'm giving a talk at Linux will

01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:54,360
Expo Expo in expect in Atlanta in

01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,500
October and they wanted me do a keynote

01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:59,850
there and I didn't know what I was going

01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:03,770
to talk about well no I do and I'll talk

01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:08,850
about the the new Perl where it's going

01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:09,870
as a language the language design is now

01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:12,870
going to be separate from the

01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:15,020
implementation design and we've got a

01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:18,270
number of other positions that we've

01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:20,450
named names for and you'll see those if

01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:28,020
you if you look at the the press release

01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:30,420
but the the schedule is not nailed down

01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:32,160
yet but you know we'll try to act a bit

01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,640
like 20 here'd bosses and do some of

01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,640
that scheduling

01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,240
six that are different from the code

01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:48,240
what's back

01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,190
yeah I don't know how strict aspect it

01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:10,800
will be from the language design point

01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:14,130
of view I'm not I'm not really big on

01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:16,170
that first X but you know and there's

01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:18,360
there some value to using the reference

01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:19,890
implementation approach and what we have

01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,270
is a reference we're currently have it's

01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:24,030
a reference implementation with no

01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:29,580
second implementation well and let's

01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:31,560
check out the JVM work but you know

01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:33,930
obviously there are benefits having

01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:35,460
things specified well enough that you

01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:38,700
could implement another one even if you

01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:49,830
didn't want to so what will definitely

01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:51,750
be working in that direction and and I'm

01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:56,330
also gonna say uh what what we

01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:56,330
particularly want to stress in terms of

01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:04,710
is not not perhaps so much the spec as

01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:06,120
developing our current regression test

01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:08,330
so we call them regression tests but

01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:11,010
they're all looking for acceptance tests

01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:12,990
but you know develop our acceptance test

01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:14,940
or a real regression testing you further

01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:17,700
develop the real regression test into a

01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:19,320
validation test of what the language

01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,390
actually means and actually go out and

01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:25,020
explore all the nooks and cranny's say

01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:26,970
this is Perl this is not real and then

01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:29,580
then we we actually have a machine

01:06:26,970 --> 01:06:32,040
readable spec and to me that's that's

01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:35,010
actually a lot more important than what

01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:37,250
the verbage on the human readable thing

01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:37,250
says

01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:42,369
these gentlemen standing in the middle

01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:43,750
here actually have microphones so if

01:06:42,369 --> 01:06:46,390
you'd like to ask a question feel free

01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:47,410
to go over there and that way the rest

01:06:46,390 --> 01:07:02,790
of your needs will be able to hear what

01:06:47,410 --> 01:07:02,790
your question is low blood sugar

01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:25,910
I know the cure for low blood sugar high

01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:29,450
blood sugar I think one of the problems

01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:33,560
with the p5p model is the infrastructure

01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:36,710
itself of mailing lists tends to push

01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:38,540
people into a you know I say this but I

01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:40,160
say that but I say this but I say that

01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:41,590
you know kind of hanging against each

01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,810
other and not really resolving anything

01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:46,250
there's various kinds of work

01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:48,350
horse-trader did its ibis project and

01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:50,390
there's wiki's and things like that that

01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:51,500
are used to try and resolve things and

01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:53,390
give people a place to put their

01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,460
argument as best possible and then they

01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:56,870
can move on to something else so you

01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:58,520
might want to look in some of that yeah

01:07:56,870 --> 01:08:00,020
we're already planning to do some of

01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:03,800
that that sort of thing each working

01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:08,800
group will have somebody in charge who

01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:11,330
makes the final decisions we will have

01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:14,360
mailing lists which are at least

01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:17,450
two-tiered in that they will have you

01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:20,089
know official inner ringers and and but

01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:22,040
anybody can listen in and contribute

01:08:20,089 --> 01:08:23,780
second indirectly if they want to

01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:26,300
contribute through the actual working

01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:30,620
group via you know the people who are

01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:33,859
actually on the working group we want to

01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:37,490
have an official RFC sort of kind of

01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:39,320
mechanism for you know not just this you

01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:41,270
know sort of off the top of your head I

01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:43,220
you know wouldn't it be nice if wouldn't

01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:48,400
it be nice at that the other thing if

01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:51,410
you have a a real proposal for a feature

01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:56,240
make up you know an official proposal in

01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:58,330
an official place with with all the

01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:02,650
things that make an official proposal

01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:02,650
and you know

01:09:03,929 --> 01:09:13,259
I guess them thank you for taking on

01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:17,779
this endeavor can you hint at any

01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:17,779
language changes that you're considering

01:09:20,029 --> 01:09:30,239
no I some of them everything is

01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:35,940
negotiable but you know everything will

01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:41,520
not be traded away on a philosophical

01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:43,409
level I I have the the profound feeling

01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,759
that if I like something other people

01:09:43,409 --> 01:09:47,310
will like it and if I don't like

01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:50,040
something other people probably don't

01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:53,029
like it so much and so I really trust my

01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:55,230
instincts on where things will be going

01:09:53,029 --> 01:09:57,360
and I without getting a lot of feedback

01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:59,100
on that too I have we've been getting a

01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:02,100
lot of feedback for less than years on

01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:05,100
things that people you know thinker are

01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:07,230
kind of grody no first of so I mean

01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,820
there's really no reason why formats

01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:11,250
should be in the core anymore they

01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:17,699
should be a you know coming in as a

01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:20,159
module there are things that could be

01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:27,030
done perhaps to to clean up ambiguities

01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:31,380
in indirect objects intact there's you

01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:34,590
know basically what we are saying at

01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:36,540
this point is if if we are going to bite

01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:38,670
the bait bite the bullet and require

01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:41,940
translation of purified the Perl sticks

01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:44,820
that really means that we can consider

01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:48,390
anything that still allows us to

01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:49,679
translate most scripts now we do not

01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:52,020
expect to build with translate

01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:55,770
hundred-percent but if I if we can

01:10:52,020 --> 01:11:00,780
translate you know with 95% accuracy 95%

01:10:55,770 --> 01:11:03,210
of the scripts and 100% accuracy 80% of

01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:05,630
the scripts you guys just getting in the

01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:05,630
ballpark

01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:14,640
but you know on the other hand sometimes

01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:19,320
you have to break a few somethings or

01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:21,540
other to make it almost other specific

01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:28,320
features remember any of the ones we

01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:29,840
mains names yeah you know think about

01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,010
all the things that other other

01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:36,870
languages saying Y and Y and yeah about

01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:40,020
and maybe we'll consider doing those you

01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:41,520
know byte compilation is a standard way

01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:46,740
of doing things rather than sort of a

01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:51,540
you know second cousin we are going to

01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:57,060
seriously look at at mark-and-sweep

01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:59,700
garbage collection and the possibility

01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:05,360
of separating out the functionality of

01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:05,360
how you finalize things from destructors

01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:12,060
that that that sort of thing becomes a

01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:13,830
little harder to write a translator to

01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:15,780
translate for the five-minute rotation

01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:19,890
so there's those various trade-offs

01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:25,890
there and language decisions like that

01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:28,020
are never easy but somewhere in there we

01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:31,110
draw the line between okay it's really

01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:32,460
easy to fix these things and it's hard

01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:33,510
to fix these things here's the ones in

01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,870
the middle that we have to really think

01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:35,870
hard about

01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:45,750
one of the problems of language

01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:47,850
translators would lose all the comments

01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:54,000
and formatting and things like not the

01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:56,400
octave Perl translator I wrote that well

01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,770
to make sure that will be the way it

01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,630
works in the profiles approach it may it

01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:04,980
may lose some of the formatting

01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:06,810
information but there's ways to annotate

01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:09,330
a syntax tree with with additional

01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:10,770
information you know and if we have to

01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:12,710
be a little incestuous with the compiler

01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:16,890
and turn off certain optimizations to

01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:19,050
get a more pristine syntax tree to

01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:20,700
translate that a lot things like that

01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:23,850
can be done I mean this is this is a

01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:25,800
subject that I enjoy doing things like

01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:28,890
that so I don't think you need to worry

01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:31,400
about that not getting done reasonably

01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:31,400
adequately

01:13:39,489 --> 01:13:46,110
yeah the question was is there a

01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,110
possibility of a switch statement

01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:53,200
there's there's always been the

01:13:50,410 --> 01:14:04,110
possibility of a switch statement but

01:13:53,200 --> 01:14:04,110
yeah certainly not gonna promise it

01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:16,450
you guys work this right I can get lots

01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,450
of Pepsi here

01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:46,630
we intend to be our own fenders body I

01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:48,699
somewhat disagree with your bracketing

01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:50,140
and indentation style but respect your

01:14:48,699 --> 01:14:52,570
right to observe your particular

01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:54,040
religion with the automatic language

01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:56,260
translation that you're having well I

01:14:54,040 --> 01:15:21,850
have within reason the ability to

01:14:56,260 --> 01:15:23,770
observe my religion how long have you

01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:27,570
been thinking about doing this how long

01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:27,570
doing on it yesterday

01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:47,690
are you kind of leaving any changes to

01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:49,429
pod everything is negotiable now you

01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:50,780
said you wish to steal from some

01:15:49,429 --> 01:16:01,610
languages which language is in

01:15:50,780 --> 01:16:02,960
particular elasticy identification

01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:07,460
division you know so I always a water

01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:08,630
that identification division it no

01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:09,860
really I don't want an identification

01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:12,590
division there's a problem with

01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:15,290
identification division is it really

01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:17,510
puts a crimp in prose poetry organs in

01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:20,239
COBOL poetry how many poems can you

01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:25,659
start off identification division one

01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:27,170
yeah well what's your favorite language

01:16:25,659 --> 01:16:37,219
besides bro

01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:40,250
besides pearl yeah well okay you know

01:16:37,219 --> 01:16:42,710
lots of lots of languages do a more of a

01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:46,460
bytecode thing some of these things a

01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:48,619
lot of these things are not borrowing

01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:50,389
through a specific language there's

01:16:48,619 --> 01:16:54,829
multiple languages which uses the

01:16:50,389 --> 01:16:56,270
bytecode thing there's there's various

01:16:54,829 --> 01:16:58,639
languages with a cleaner object

01:16:56,270 --> 01:17:03,610
interface to their i/o and such there's

01:16:58,639 --> 01:17:10,270
lots of languages

01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:10,270
various things but we

01:17:11,989 --> 01:17:18,239
when something like when you see all the

01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:20,969
new languages coming out and they all

01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:23,149
have a garbage collector you know and

01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:25,469
that helps them fit together into like

01:17:23,149 --> 01:17:28,079
browsers and things I like that better

01:17:25,469 --> 01:17:33,300
you start thinking maybe think about

01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:35,609
that Larry were more people of course

01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:37,919
are using Perl today to write larger and

01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:39,479
larger software is there anything in

01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:41,609
Perl things pearl stick that you can

01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:45,300
think of offhand that might make that

01:17:41,609 --> 01:17:46,709
easier large software tend to have time

01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:49,559
to appreciate things like stronger type

01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:52,739
checking checking for example yes

01:17:49,559 --> 01:17:54,239
certainly you know we already got the

01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:57,199
hooks in there to start putting some

01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:59,519
some type things in there optionally and

01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:02,609
you know you could you have a use strict

01:17:59,519 --> 01:18:07,169
type checking if you wanted to pragma or

01:18:02,609 --> 01:18:09,329
use stricter or something you can use

01:18:07,169 --> 01:18:10,530
use you know bondage and discipline

01:18:09,329 --> 01:18:19,829
write whatever you want to call the

01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:20,219
module but yeah and also part of the

01:18:19,829 --> 01:18:23,280
redesign

01:18:20,219 --> 01:18:25,979
here's your the biggie we intend to get

01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:30,599
rid of quite a few of those strange

01:18:25,979 --> 01:18:35,939
global variables or you know the strange

01:18:30,599 --> 01:18:44,519
ones we will certainly get rid of dollar

01:18:35,939 --> 01:18:45,300
sharp okay okay thank you very much

01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:47,629
ma'am there will be more questions

01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,629
tomorrow

01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,989
