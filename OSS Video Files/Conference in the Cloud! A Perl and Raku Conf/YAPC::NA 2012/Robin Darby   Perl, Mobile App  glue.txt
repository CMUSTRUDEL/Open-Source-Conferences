it's cool at all right guys it's about

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,200
it's about eleven o'clock so I'm going

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:16,580
to get on and start this get it over and

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:19,650
done with all right ah hello everybody

00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:23,850
thank you for coming to my my talk on

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,039
pull glue three perlas mobile glue and

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,630
if you haven't done already you might

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,340
want to go and you've got an iphone you

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,170
might want to go on to the App Store and

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,149
do a search for pearl glue you can

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,050
download the little demo app I prepared

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:39,390
for this this session I apologize for it

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,660
in advance burning if that's the way the

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,640
cookie crumbles ok guys I want to tell

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,210
you a story and it would be familiar to

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,430
most of you but about 12 months ago my

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,579
my boss came to me and inform me that

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,350
you we just acquired a company and

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,199
basically we were buying them for their

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,690
mobile app on the iPhone and the Android

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,670
it was called ski report I mean a skiing

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,680
industry over for Vail Resorts we're

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,530
interested in promoting the the industry

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,939
generally an overall ok so i was

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,280
informed that we wanted to make some

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,340
changes now some were really small just

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,780
like changing images and branding it

00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,880
others were bigger like changing the ad

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,979
provider and adding new functionality

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,259
like trail maps you know we'd like you

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,250
to go up on the mountain and be able to

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,290
use our apps to find your way around it

00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,079
ok so I met with the original developer

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,880
and got my hands on the source code

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,979
initially what surprised me was that the

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,509
suit there were two parts of the source

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,299
code there was the code for the device

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,579
in Java and Objective C which was

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,009
obviously iphone and android but also

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,680
there was PHP hanging around in the

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,170
repository and this surprised me at

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,030
first I mean why what's the server got

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,530
to do with an iphone app right the all

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,049
the code should be in the same place but

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,729
as I looked at the functionality out

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,969
this became clear I mean there was a lot

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:02,610
of interaction between the the phone and

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,799
the server there were there were the

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:08,069
server was giving the phone weather

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,750
information and snow information but

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,640
also it was the other way around two so

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,900
you could actually post comments about a

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,599
resort

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,310
or you know join up with your friends

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,489
and this was all going back to our

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,739
servers and been stored on it okay so

00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:25,860
this made sense I checked out and hosted

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:29,010
the PHP cranked up Xcode and Eclipse

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,510
made some minor changes everything was

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,400
looking sweet I got through an

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:36,299
acquisition without losing my hair and

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,250
too much sleep however it wasn't too

00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:40,230
long before our editor came along and

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,420
noticed that the data on the mobile

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:46,230
phone was actually different to the data

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,180
on our site which is on the snow calm ah

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,370
but this was easier to explain because

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,280
they use different databases right the

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,840
database is on the mobile phone had the

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,639
resorts there and there was a database

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,230
on our site and the two didn't match up

00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:04,200
so I'd explain the problem to my editor

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,090
but he wasn't happy with this and I'd

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,609
spent some time pushing jireh tickets

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,799
around and noticing that rounded corners

00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:12,540
didn't work in IE 4 and 5 so that was

00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,739
vastly more important than solving this

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,079
PHP problem right but none of this made

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,760
my editor happy and eventually he teamed

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:26,609
up with my boss and force me to do

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:29,879
something about it now I wasn't looking

00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:34,769
forward to this I hate PHP it's like

00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:36,299
pearls ogly fat system so I decided the

00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:38,940
best thing to do in order to preserve my

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:43,159
sanity was to port this entire system

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,159
over to pearl so now it got interesting

00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,919
so this talk who is about my password

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:58,049
yeah so this talk there's a ski report

00:03:54,449 --> 00:04:00,359
app so this talk is not about developing

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:03,030
apps sorry about that you still got time

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:04,769
if you can leave if you want to you're

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,919
not going to get pearl onto a mobile

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:10,590
phone unless you jailbreak it and that's

00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,409
not the people that I'm looking to to

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,489
deploy apps to however some of what I'm

00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:16,139
going to cover today is going to be

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:20,220
applicable to you however you're going

00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:22,200
to deploy your app so the first thing we

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,630
will talk about is how do you create an

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,950
app what do you do how do you start this

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,530
process

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,360
well for me creating any bit of software

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,730
is like building a house and not just

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,560
putting up shelves so I start with the

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,570
basic steps of development and obviously

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,730
that's your waterfall model its research

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,990
you do your research you do a bit of

00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,580
design which I'm going to go over a

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,650
little bit and then you implement the

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,800
thing and then you send it to the users

00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,840
and they tested for you now what I laid

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,820
out there doesn't sound very agile and

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,700
we're all into agile methodologies and

00:04:50,820 --> 00:05:00,570
scrums so what I like to do is add one

00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:02,400
more step now one critical thing is a

00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,620
bear in mind is if you release buggy

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,690
software buggy apps you're going to lose

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,040
your users straightaway you Otis when

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,470
you download this app and have a look

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,120
I'm going to lose you straight away

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,950
you're not very likely to come back I

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,270
mean I've given you a shoddy product and

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,970
you don't want to use it and you won't

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,070
be updating anymore the other thing to

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,200
think about is the ratings on the iphone

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,380
is king else on the iphone and the

00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:29,460
android basically research has shown

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,110
that app users behave more like shoppers

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,110
than they do traditional internet users

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:37,920
it's not a web page you've decided to

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,480
download this to your phone and they're

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,580
going to base their purchasing decisions

00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,710
around the user rating there's little

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,780
stars that you see in the store and also

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,340
unfortunately your marketing so you're

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,560
going to have to have good store text

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,640
it's going to have to be clear going to

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,950
be thought out there's a bit a little

00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,300
bit of SEO potential going on there so

00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,820
you need to make sure it's searchable

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,460
think about keywords and localization

00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,230
and all this good stuff now this is

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,670
probably because of the format of the

00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,440
deployment mechanism I mean it's in a

00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:08,040
store it's an app store so people are

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,990
behaving like shoppers right let's have

00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,520
a look at the your revenue model in the

00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,920
relationship you have to the users is a

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,720
bit of marketing 101 for people who

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,230
don't care about marketing but it's very

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,120
simple so you're free app has no ads

00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:24,480
you're probably doing it for research

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,490
education or just fun there is no

00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,080
revenue generated from this model then

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,760
you may choose this route because you're

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,600
learning how to develop apps which is

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,890
you know great and the ins and outs of

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,040
the App Store which can be a nightmare

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,270
in itself certificates and such you're

00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,840
trying to all you're trying to generate

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,360
a following

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,430
it's it'll get your name out there it'll

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,020
get your brand out there reputation as a

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,850
valuable thing it may even be worth

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,550
launching a few apps just to get so

00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,770
people can notice you I would put this

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,160
as you're just friends I mean if you

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,940
meet a user they made by your point

00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,979
another model very similar to this is a

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,930
it's free apps with a website backing

00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:06,510
now your revenue model is generated by

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,040
your website and your app is really just

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,650
a front for that website probably

00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,889
renders the same exact same data in the

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,780
same views and this is great because you

00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:17,790
can leverage your same user base as the

00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,400
website and they're going to be far more

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,580
likely to use your ad so you know your

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,380
strategy there is that you are friends

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,760
with your users nothing too serious it

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:31,200
might be a little bit of like petting

00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:33,539
going on them free out with ads you're

00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,340
in a relationship with your users you're

00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:37,080
both going to get very hurt if they stop

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,940
to use your device I mean your revenue

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,440
comes from the ads so you need people to

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:49,530
look at it ok so the band's one paid app

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:51,479
which is 99 cents you've got engaged you

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,860
must start on your best relate you must

00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,810
start your relationship on the best

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,240
fitting you don't want to upset your

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,979
users you owe them some measure of

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,550
support I mean they've given you a buck

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:04,200
right so you owe them something Banda

00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,510
greater than 1 now this is greater than

00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,729
99 cents you've all seen $10 apps or

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,940
even $30 apps now this is getting very

00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:13,680
serious so you've just got married you

00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,590
they've shown a level of commitment to

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,940
you and you have to respect that and

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,410
work hard to keep them because you're

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,090
going to be in trouble if you want to

00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,470
charge ten dollars for a nap in your app

00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,680
is crap then you're not going to make

00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,960
very much money probably ten dollars

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:31,440
right my demographic with this little

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,969
app that I made is you guys now I wanted

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,789
to build that basically so I can

00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,990
demonstrate the whole process but I may

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,479
as well trying to make it a little bit

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,950
useful so let's do something that might

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,950
help with yap see let's build a

00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,330
scheduled appt now what is a scheduled

00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,810
appt what does it do although our

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:53,190
features so let's show a schedule of

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:54,900
talks show some talk information

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:59,040
let's let the users create a list of

00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:00,420
talks they want to go to let's let users

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,030
actually comment and talk so there's a

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,290
bit of feedback there and let users rate

00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:08,520
talk so that's the second bit of

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:10,380
feedback now diagramming your use cases

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,440
really helps you to tie down the user

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,180
interaction i tend to slavishly go

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,910
through this process every time I write

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,350
even a little bit of a hack so what I'm

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,080
going to do this is a general use case

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,910
diagram you can see the interactions

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,500
that we're just described before on this

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,300
page now I'm just putting this up just

00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,010
to show you how pretty diagrams can be

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,840
and that you should all be drawing

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,800
pretty diagrams it it makes it look as

00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,730
though you do a lot of work and that's

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,680
great now we've seen the use cases now

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:41,190
that nailed down we can start to develop

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,720
an object model this helps us to work

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,670
out which objects we're going to have

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,370
but also helps us to model our data in a

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:50,670
way now you should have all seen you

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,230
around I grams or a very nervous if you

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,790
haven't there are plenty of books out

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,130
there that are going to help you work it

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,620
out I mean I've been doing this for a

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:01,320
while so my UML probably isn't anything

00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,450
like real UML I tend to blend the

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,080
different methodologies that I've used

00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,820
into one useful one that's useful to me

00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,700
and that's okay because I'm not sitting

00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,050
in exam this is just for me and my

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,020
colleagues to work out what the hell I'm

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,260
thinking about next thing I go through

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,820
is I tend to try and do some mock-ups

00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,410
now these are some various screens that

00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,200
I thought about implementing whilst I

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:27,540
was thinking about this app and you know

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,820
you have a list of talks and a date

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,860
thing and maybe a page with some talk

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,440
information now this is great because

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,970
when you develop an app it's a lot

00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,880
different from developing an HTML page

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:41,460
where you have a lot more freedom with

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,900
CSS and HTML mmm elements actually when

00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,510
you build an app you have a very limited

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:48,750
range of objects you can put there you

00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:51,000
have standard list objects you have you

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,680
know a button tray or whatever they want

00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,420
to call it a date object which you know

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,600
that's fantastic for me because I'm a

00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:00,540
rubbish at CSS so it avoids all that

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:05,339
horrible pixel munching stuff that we

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:06,350
have to do with HTML okay so developing

00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,750
your client this is

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,600
the device the app that's going to go to

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:14,200
the dice kind of comes down to two good

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,570
choices for me now you have phonegap

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:20,660
which is basically you deploy HTML to

00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:22,640
your phone and it's cross-platform it

00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,820
works pretty much on every mobile device

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:30,290
Android iPhone Blackberry lots of

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:34,070
obsolete crap cross-platform html5 so

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:35,690
you probably already know HTML access to

00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,910
all the device functionality which is

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,760
great because you can get like you can

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,040
make it send alerts you can get you can

00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,890
work the compass you can work the camera

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,770
the microphone it'll basically do all of

00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,000
that it's pretty marvelous stuff um the

00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,710
other choice is obviously to write it

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,140
native now this the apps going to be

00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:56,300
faster it's going to be a better user

00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,040
experience as you will find out when you

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,040
look at the app that I wrote that if I

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,480
wrote it natively it would be a lot a

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,710
lot better user experience and it's

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,110
going to be stable oh you're not going

00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,580
to have so many problems but obviously

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,350
the drawback from that it's going to be

00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,800
more expensive to develop and you have

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:17,630
to develop one for every single platform

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:20,330
so I decided to develop for develop it

00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:22,760
in phonegap because i'm not interested

00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,020
in making money out of this thing it's

00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,640
just a demo and i'm not really

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,830
interested in creating or following

00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:32,560
which I said would you want this guy

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:35,240
following you know thank you okay so

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,390
however having seen the final result I

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:43,220
kind of wish I wrote this app natively

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:45,380
just talk about the server so we're

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,440
going to talk to the client via Jason

00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:50,240
you can use XML or you can even even

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,740
invent your own protocol but Jason works

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,150
nicely with phonegap and native

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:56,030
platforms so it's a good choice for all

00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:57,920
around compatibility now for framework

00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,540
you can pretty much do the back end in

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,870
anything you like anything little spit

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:05,360
out Jason in our case oh that's Mason

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:08,030
mojolicious mo delicious CGI's mod curl

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,950
you know anything you like a lot of good

00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,870
tracks going on about service based

00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,340
architecture and you know a lot for me

00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:17,150
to think about and a lot for me to try

00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,470
out but regardless of your framework you

00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,180
need to make it fast and reliable

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,460
remember you shouldn't tie

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,620
server implementations your client we

00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,110
may start our project with phonegap but

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,210
later go on to write it natively so if

00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,800
you have to use web views or web pages

00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,260
then make sure you retrieve their data

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,960
via service cause I mean that might be a

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,339
simple Ajax cool that's fine this way

00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,050
when we want to migrate to something

00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:42,080
else later it's all there and it's all

00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:44,420
easy right I'm going to go with a very

00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,190
bare-bones mod perl approach i'm going

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,620
to develop my class is using mousex

00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:51,260
declare because i think it's super

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,790
pretty and great for prototyping i think

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,279
it's a great way to educate people and

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,350
how pretty pearl can be but if I was

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:01,970
serious about this app then I'd probably

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:04,040
migrate it to mouse right in here some

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,320
cold I don't know if you can see it but

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,870
it's all blurry it's one of the things I

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,690
love about musics declare is the is the

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:14,000
class declaration I don't have to worry

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,459
about declaring self or any of my

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,890
arguments I've got strict prototyping in

00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:21,050
there it's fantastic you really

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:23,750
seriously suggest you check out mousex

00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:27,320
declare it'll make your pearl look like

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:30,680
a proper programming language I'm going

00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:32,570
to get a lynched but the drawback is

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,750
it's not quick there's a significant pay

00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:38,240
back to mousex declare when you load up

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,860
the I'm code I mean we're using mod

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,350
pearls so we don't have to worry about

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,790
that initial load too much but a

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,190
colleague did demonstrate to me the

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,600
other day that his implementation of my

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:51,709
classes will four hundred times faster

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,420
so here's one of the mod perl handlers

00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:55,130
handlers now it's not appropriate to

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,589
these mistakes declare for a mod perl

00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,660
handling I've done it and people

00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:01,750
criticize that a lot but this is

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,100
standard package multiple handler

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,290
basically all we're doing here is we're

00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,959
going to use the URL structure which

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:11,480
I'll show you in a minute to work out

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,970
what the ID of a story is for example

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,709
and what action we want to perform we're

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,310
just grabbing them from the you from the

00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:22,250
URL and then we have this big case block

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:24,560
which just points it towards what i call

00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:28,339
it asserts in this case and that will do

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,610
are all our functionality now it may not

00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:34,160
look clear what's going on here but

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:36,589
basically Apaches calling on

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,180
pull handle on based on the rules laid

00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:40,759
out in the config file sharing the

00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,769
minute the handler calls something I've

00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,500
called a scheduled service service colon

00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:47,750
scholars colon Colonel schedule which

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,389
checks and converts incoming parameters

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:55,009
into an intern will call the object

00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:56,740
model produce some JSON output so you

00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:59,509
can see some of that their ads look

00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,569
great but that's what's going on okay so

00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:05,060
designing a URL scheme out at some point

00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:06,680
you're going to have to design the

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,269
interface between your client in your

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,120
apache server these are basically just

00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:12,139
URLs and we think like the twitter api

00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,589
and you're going to have to come up with

00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:17,569
some kind of schema and document it now

00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:20,870
what I've gone for is I've gone for a

00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:23,269
class ID and then action so class is

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:26,120
something like a talk or a schedule and

00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:28,550
ID would be the torque ID and then the

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:32,089
action is obviously you know standard

00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:35,300
delete add put whatever so here's an

00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:37,250
example of the horrible example of the

00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,560
apache config file which shows you how

00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,600
i'm doing that the dispatch dispatch the

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,579
bullet shows you how basically how i'm

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,430
rooting these requests so that's my

00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:48,319
class it's a talks and there's my ID is

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,880
going to be in the range of it's going

00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:52,100
to be a number of multiple numbers and

00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,810
in this case we're going to allow people

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,130
to post comments now you're going to

00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,980
have to come up with your own schemer I

00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:59,420
don't know any hard-and-fast rules about

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,819
this i don't really know any best

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:06,319
practices so you're on your own mate

00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:08,510
make your own up ok collecting glass ids

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,079
you're going to have to identify each

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:14,870
user and you have several options you

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,459
could use the built-in device ID or you

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:19,640
could use a third-party framework like

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:21,110
Facebook or Twitter in our case I don't

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,689
really care who you are I don't want to

00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:28,130
know your name so I'm only interested in

00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:31,130
identifying your mobile phone so I can

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:34,010
save schedules under a unique key each

00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,690
device has its own device key but Apple

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,299
is currently banned apps directly

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,530
retrieving that device ID there are

00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:43,640
several ways around this the one I

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:45,530
prefer is open udid now i'm going to

00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,270
send unique ids with every call back to

00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,860
the server

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,960
now one of the features of our app is

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:55,010
that we can send you remote alerts to

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,860
your device both in iOS and Android they

00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,240
both do this in a very similar way

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,970
basically you need to tell the provider

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,250
you want permission to send a little an

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,350
alert to the device they will give you a

00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,950
token which you need to store for later

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:12,440
use once you have the token you can send

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:14,210
a little HTTP request including the

00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,540
token and your alert to the provider

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,920
Apple or Google as gateway in this case

00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,960
for this project I've included two

00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:24,380
classes that will do this for you both

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:28,130
use CU RL curl because they are more or

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:36,140
less ported from the PHP example oh and

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:37,850
now it goes crazy ok so I think that it

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,070
shows it there basically you collect the

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,720
token you store the token later on you

00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:45,830
grab the token and send it along with

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,570
your HTTP request and this is what we

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,930
came up with in fact I can do a little

00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,890
quick demo of me sending if i have time

00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,180
alerts which is not gonna mean anything

00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,650
because you might be able to see it but

00:18:53,180 --> 00:19:03,910
let's give it a go anyway let's check

00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:03,910
that we have some bandwidth no we don't

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:12,670
you might have to trust me that it will

00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:14,900
send alert ok and this is a really

00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:17,930
simple script I mean that's literally

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:20,060
the script to send alerts it's just give

00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:23,300
me my object stuff in the token in the

00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:25,610
message just point it to the certificate

00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,850
files which is an interesting talk all

00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:31,880
in its own and then you can send alerts

00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:34,640
so let's do that go up here and there is

00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,960
my little script with my token please

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,110
don't copy it down I don't want your

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:43,730
alerts and then we go and in a second

00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:45,200
there it sent me an alert you won't be

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:52,910
able to see it but you can trust me it

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:54,320
sent me an alert ok and this is the

00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:57,320
pages we have for our little app it's

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,300
all up on the ice storm for some reason

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,330
they approved it so if you want to get a

00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,460
hold of the code and

00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:04,799
you can look at my rubbish and send

00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,980
nasty messages to me burning that's my

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,960
github page and that's will have / glue

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,169
under it and this could talk condensed

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,899
in a wiki format so you can try and work

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:16,980
out what the hell I was talking about

00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:18,630
all the diagrams are done with this

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,450
we've seen chart bit of sausage cheddar

00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:24,929
doubt that's awesome and if any of you

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,519
go skiing ah gee have you seen on the

00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:30,539
snow dog I've seen our little ski report

00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:32,490
oh definitely be using them anyway

00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:34,799
that's our website we do snowing and

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,120
stuff so let me finish off my little

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,000
story so what happened with the ski

00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,370
report app well I poured it the PHP t

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,279
over to pearl I made extensive use of

00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,889
mousex declare I ended up learning a lot

00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:49,620
of objective-c and improving my java a

00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:51,960
lot of fun in the process new framework

00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,029
is still going we have full down

00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,519
redundancy a huge performance gain

00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:58,740
managed to get trail map functionality

00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,260
out there I'm a Boston editor are really

00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,419
happy with a huge number of features for

00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,429
this next ski season we're going to

00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:07,049
change the weather the provider we're

00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:10,080
going to include even more results from

00:21:07,049 --> 00:21:12,149
Europe now I may put the server code

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,010
over to moose and use mo delicious or

00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:17,639
something else but one thing won't

00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:19,820
change use perl for epic success thank

00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:19,820
