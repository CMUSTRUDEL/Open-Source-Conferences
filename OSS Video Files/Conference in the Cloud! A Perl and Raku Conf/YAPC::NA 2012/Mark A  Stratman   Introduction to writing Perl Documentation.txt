alright so it's about eleven-thirty 0k

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,519
if I get started alright so today we're

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,070
going to talk a little bit about

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,570
documentation with pearl a lot of this

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,400
might seem like common sense and you

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,900
know a lot of it really is but there are

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,160
some things that we do as pearl

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,840
developers that might be different from

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,939
your experience with write documentation

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,160
/ c code or java code or you know just

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,000
any other type of writing in general so

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,529
we're just going to kind of breeze

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,230
through and look at some conventions

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,469
that we like to stick to in our our

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,010
pearl documentation and you know that

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,600
there's a lot of stuff you can do with a

00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,290
lots of different types of documents we

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,629
use in our in our Perl code like we have

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,570
api documentation tutorials manuals

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,039
cookbooks there's other types of

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,030
documents to that we see what we're

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,670
dealing with pearl like for example

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,260
there's fa cubes you know there's you

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,480
can use the pearl dock utility to search

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,699
to the Corporal fa cues but we're going

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,350
to focus more on on what we do as

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,359
writers what we do when we're writing

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:11,970
code for work or code that we might

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:17,299
upload to see pan I'm sorry I forgive

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,299
him having a keyboard of shoes here

00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:40,479
sorry bear with me just a moment

00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,909
alright this is embarrassing so um let

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,380
me just try to carry on while I try to

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:09,060
fix this but basically when we write a

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,030
Perl documentation we write in something

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,209
called pod pod is basically um it's a

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,060
really simple text based markup

00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:19,709
everything and it deals with commands

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,410
all right does anybody have any

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:23,940
experience working with um Linux and

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:42,510
trying to get these dual monitor things

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:44,190
working no the problem is i'm stuck in

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:51,720
full screen on my browser and i can't

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:55,250
get it over to this other display right

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,250
there we go i think i might have just

00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:26,660
alright let's try this again there we go

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,520
alright so as I was saying pod it's it's

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,540
really simple markup and again

00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,440
appreciate your patience but um

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:38,600
everything in pod basically looks like

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:48,680
this so whenever you want to tell I'm

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:52,730
sorry Sega um I can certainly try there

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,959
we go so we have bomb if you want any

00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,270
sort of like if you want to tell pod

00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,650
what sort of element you're writing you

00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,170
start with a command paragraph and

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,880
command paragraphs are anything that

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:03,650
starts with this equal sign so if I want

00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,300
to do a heading I'll say equals head and

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,370
then a number you know the number one

00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,940
for a top level heading number two for a

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,320
second level heading if I want to do a

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,670
verbatim paragraphs like for example if

00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,320
I just want to show a code snippet I'll

00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,470
simply indent it with a little bit of

00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,410
space here and then I can do other sets

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:30,200
are formatting it too bold italic some

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:31,940
and so on it's all there we go um so you

00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,260
can see here it is rendered out after we

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,729
run it through some sort of a rendering

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,850
thing it's all pretty straightforward

00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:39,380
though and if you want you can mix your

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,910
pod with your code or you can put it in

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,020
a separate pod file it just depends what

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,030
you're trying to do for example if

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,130
you're doing an API documentation where

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,960
you're documenting each individual in

00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,340
each individual function and your API

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,620
there's a good chance you're going to

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,419
want to mix it like this so I'll be

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,790
writing some code and then I'll turn

00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:58,370
around and just start a command

00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,710
paragraph and pearl and and the pod

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,360
parsers we'll both know that hey i'm

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,100
done writing code now now i'm writing

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,840
pod right here then when i'm done

00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,500
writing my pot i can simply give it the

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,610
cut command and now it goes back to code

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,500
so that's really useful in an API

00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,030
documentation if you're writing a full

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,620
page tutorial that's not necessarily

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,770
mixed with code you know maybe you'll

00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,690
just make a standalone pod file but

00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,190
again pot is really simple I can trust

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,900
that you all can go you can open up the

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,160
pearl pod document and you can learn it

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,750
in a few minutes it's really

00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,820
straightforward and if you download

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,210
these slides there's a link in here and

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,680
there's some of

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,569
resources at the end of the presentation

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,069
where I've got some links to some

00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:36,949
tutorials that will walk you through

00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:39,889
that really quickly so let's talk a

00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,720
little bit about conventions now the

00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,130
easiest way to stick to the conventions

00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,410
and not have to worry about memorizing

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,419
anything is just start with start with a

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,009
tool like module starter module setup

00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:51,020
and these tools what they'll do is

00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:52,780
they'll start you with some boilerplate

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,310
for your module and your distribution

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:58,069
that'll have a lot of pot already

00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,900
embedded in there so it'll have all your

00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:01,570
basic sections that you need and you

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,250
just go and you fill in all the details

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,050
so it's a really simple way to get you

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,599
started not just for the pod but also

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,580
for the code and all the you know all

00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:15,830
the other toolkits stuff you need as

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:17,150
well now when you're dealing with API

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,919
documents you're going to see a lot of

00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,539
different types of sections in those

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:23,900
documents and it's going to vary a lot

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:26,030
depending upon what that API is for so

00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,009
in general you know the best advice

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,270
anybody can ever give you about

00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:31,180
documentation is just trust your

00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,560
judgment you know if you think your

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,419
particular distribution doesn't need an

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,099
incompatibility section because it's not

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:38,599
incompatible with anything just simply

00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:42,050
omit it it's it's really not a

00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:43,849
hard-and-fast science but the ones i

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,440
have in bold here i don't know if you

00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:47,289
can see it on the screen but those are

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,210
those are some of the more common ones

00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:52,370
but again you know those those we will

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,900
be put into your documentation by the

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,370
module starter the module set up

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,860
utilities and that'll that'll get you

00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:02,840
started right there anyway but let's

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,430
talk about a few of the common ones for

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,199
example the name section I mean that's

00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,400
pretty straight for you put the name but

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,719
we're a little pearl people are a little

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,860
bit picky about this and recently

00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,840
there's a little more contention about

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,389
it but basically you just put the name

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,490
of your module with a dash and then just

00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:21,610
a really short description the synapses

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:23,659
synopsis is my favorite section I think

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,580
you know this is my opinion obviously

00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:27,560
but in general I think the synopsis is

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,270
probably the most important thing you

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,530
can put in your API documentation the

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,389
synopsis is the thing that you want to

00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,520
spend the most time and think the most

00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:36,650
about and you want to assume that it's

00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,719
the only thing your users are going to

00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,460
read Andy and you should assume this for

00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:41,969
two reasons one it's going to force you

00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,219
to

00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:46,409
think more carefully about what you put

00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:48,119
in your synopsis and then to you know

00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:50,669
because maybe it actually will be the

00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:52,439
only thing people will read so what what

00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:54,629
you want in your synapses specifically

00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:57,179
is you want a chunk of code that's

00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:59,429
really simple really trim down but

00:07:57,179 --> 00:08:01,649
hopefully ideally covers you know as

00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:03,899
much of your API as possible so you want

00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,829
your synopsis to try to cover I just

00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:06,119
threw these numbers in there but you

00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:08,039
know try to cover 80 to a hundred

00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:10,319
percent of your API so any possible

00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,879
functions that your code does have them

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,669
have them shown have them illustrated

00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,319
here in the synopsis but you also want

00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:18,539
to keep the synopsis simple like try to

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,949
trim out any business specific logic or

00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,259
anything that might confuse the readers

00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:24,629
just try to keep it as generic as

00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,369
possible and I just pulled a simple

00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,779
example from config any but you can look

00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:30,059
at any common module and you can see

00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:33,479
some examples of how a synopsis usually

00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:34,709
look and in fact that that's something

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,300
to keep in mind a lot when you're

00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:37,680
writing documentation is if you're ever

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,149
in doubt you know rule number one is

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,209
always just trust your gut write what

00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:43,709
you think you should write but also

00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:45,509
don't be afraid to just go search Sipan

00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:47,160
and go find some example modules and see

00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:49,379
what other people do so just look at

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,149
other peoples examples for and in just

00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:55,589
try to follow suit and then another

00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:58,040
pretty important section is the

00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:00,059
description section that's going to have

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,990
basically whatever you need it to have

00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:03,540
it's going to have some additional

00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:06,029
background information you can use it to

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,920
tap to you know tell your readers why

00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:09,720
they should use your module as opposed

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,920
to some you know other one that does

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,930
something similar what makes yours

00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,279
different what's the background story

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,769
why did you write this code in the first

00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,790
place what problems does it solve so the

00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:21,449
descriptions kind of your background

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,939
story to to get the user started and you

00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:27,000
can have a see also section or where you

00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:27,990
can link to you know related modules you

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,360
can be linked to other sites you can

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:33,000
link to other documents and you'll see

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,470
there you see I do L and then open

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,449
bracket closed bracket that's that's

00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,579
just a pod command for saying this is a

00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:40,949
link to something and when you go and

00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:42,839
look at the pod tutorials you'll find

00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:44,670
examples of how to link along with the

00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,980
other formatting commands like bold and

00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,980
italics and and other common stuff

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,020
so yeah so so far we've been talking

00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,920
mostly about these api documentation is

00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,570
where we're gonna have the name the

00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,760
synopsis the description here's a list

00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,930
of all the functions you know they're

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,730
very common you're going to read these

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,910
you know hundred times a day they're

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,860
very necessary obviously but it's it's

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,630
not always enough and in fact i think

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,880
too often we rely upon the api

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,460
documentation I think too often we say

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,050
well I wrote this code I gave you this

00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,880
API documentation that tells you how to

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,820
use this now figure it out do what you

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,220
want to do but it really doesn't hurt us

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,910
to go in and you know add additional

00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:28,040
types of documentation like a tutorial

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,210
so you know you can write a document

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,390
that's going to walk your users

00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,770
step-by-step through using this code and

00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,450
usually tutorials are going to do

00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,280
something like start out with a very

00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:40,100
simple example then we're going to build

00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,900
on to it layer by layer and go through

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,470
the tutorial and build up the users

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,680
confidence in this code but you can also

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,150
do things like a cookbook where you have

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,370
specific recipes so you're going to say

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,810
given this problem here is a

00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,910
cut-and-paste solution you can slap in

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,440
your code to solve that problem and you

00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,160
know this is this is more common in a

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,600
very large code base where you've got a

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,339
framework that can do a lot of stuff for

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,080
you the example I used to here's dbx

00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:09,530
class that's a very large you know

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,820
database excuse me a library that can

00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,960
solve a lot of problems in a lot of

00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,640
different way so it makes sense for them

00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,230
to have a cookbook but that's not to say

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,230
you couldn't use it for a simpler thing

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,880
you can also have just generic manual

00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:25,130
type documents and there's really no

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,420
hard and fast rules for manual say it

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,130
can be whatever you need it to be you

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,110
might use it as a starting point where

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,370
the user before they read anything else

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,780
they come to the manual page and maybe

00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,280
that's the page you're going to link to

00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,280
the API documentation you're going to

00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,290
link to the tutorials you know maybe

00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,060
it's just going to be a few paragraphs

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,620
of introduction to eget you know it

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,480
really depends what you're trying to do

00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,700
but if you're ever saying to yourself I

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,530
really want to write this particular

00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,990
guidance for the user but i'm not sure

00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:53,089
what notch or like what's slot to slide

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:56,060
it into just just create a manual

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:57,230
namespace in your package and just just

00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,760
stick it in there so you might have you

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,970
know your module colon colon manual and

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,230
put whatever you need to put in there

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:08,339
and then once you've got all your beer

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,470
all your documentation written you know

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:11,850
there's the most common way we look at

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,399
that documentation is usually through

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:16,110
the pearl excuse me the pearl dot

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,699
command and you know that will render it

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,230
on your screen and plain text just fine

00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:20,699
but there's there's plenty of other

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,500
formats you can deal with you know if

00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:24,569
you've ever looked at meta steep and org

00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,449
or search deep and org you've seen

00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:29,759
people's pod rendered in HTML but you

00:12:27,449 --> 00:12:31,740
can also render it in PDFs or latex or

00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,230
you know whatever you need to and it

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,970
again if you download this on these

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,829
slides you can click these links and

00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,250
look at various types of rendering tools

00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:44,009
the biggest and probably one of the most

00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,199
um most useful distributions right now

00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:49,319
for rendering pod in different formats

00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:51,089
is this pod simple library they've got

00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:54,720
all kinds of different code in there for

00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:56,040
for dealing with pod and since we can

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,540
deal with so many different formats you

00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,089
can actually do conditional formatting

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,389
in your documentation so for example I

00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:05,279
can put a command in here that says with

00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:07,379
this begin command I can say if you're

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,480
dealing with HTML I want you to show

00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:11,819
this image tag and I want you to show my

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,889
diagram but if you're not dealing with

00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:16,259
HTML and you just have plain text well

00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:19,649
print out my my highly technical ASCII

00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:21,089
diagram to compensate for that you know

00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,860
at least what the user sees something

00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:32,970
instead of nothing but it doesn't

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:35,040
necessarily have to be um that's a very

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,490
good question actually I let's look at

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,680
this for a moment first um so if you in

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,889
this particular example and this is from

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,350
an HTML barcode rendering library if

00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:48,809
you're looking at it in HTML I mean why

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,370
not show this rendered this rendered on

00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:52,769
barcode I mean it was made for HTML

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,540
anyways so in the HTML rendering I show

00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:56,339
this barcode but i didn't put an

00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,689
alternative format in there i didn't i

00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,670
didn't tell the pod what to do for a

00:13:57,689 --> 00:14:02,040
text document or PDF document or latex

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,980
document so in the text version it's

00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:09,269
simply omitted so does that answer your

00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,860
question okay well I mean basically you

00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:11,910
choose you choose how you want to format

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,160
it you choose whether you want to

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,010
display alternates or if you don't

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,190
specify a particular format it's going

00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:20,750
simply omit it that's that's provided

00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,640
you're in a command paragraph where you

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,340
told it this is only for this particular

00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,140
type so I gave it a command paragraph

00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,670
saying this is only for HTML only show

00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,740
this during HTML and that's good for

00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,870
value-added sort of stuff things that

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:38,660
aren't essential but they're nice to see

00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:40,160
if it's if it's available and yeah so

00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,710
finally I just want to I want to take

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,320
this time to just make a quick very

00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,880
common sense note that it's very useful

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,730
to try to encourage others to get

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,900
involved in documentation and I really

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,420
want to point this out because we kind

00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,400
of have this mentality in the Pro well

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,900
I'd like to say that technical people in

00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,180
general seem to have this mentality that

00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,700
the author of the code the person who

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,950
created this this work that we're

00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,140
documenting is the expert so therefore

00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:08,600
they're the only person who can and

00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,910
should be excuse me who can and should

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,740
be writing the documentation we have

00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,090
this mentality that well the author's

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,070
the expert therefore they're the best

00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:18,110
person but I don't agree with that I

00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,880
don't think that's true there's there's

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,490
a lot of reasons why you might not

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,320
necessarily want the author to be

00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,600
writing and controlling all the

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,300
documentation the author might be too

00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,620
close to that that code they might take

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,390
for granted some of the knowledge they

00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,370
have about it precisely because they are

00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,720
the expert like I might think well

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,610
anybody's going to figure that out

00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,380
because obviously I know it really well

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,180
so everybody else will but that's kind

00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,280
of a risky assumption to make because I

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:46,720
don't know what other people's

00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:49,120
backgrounds or experiences are so um

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,900
it's very good to get that extra

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:58,880
external viewpoint on this so you know

00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,870
other other people who may other people

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,130
who may want to contribute to the

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,930
document you know they might have

00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,250
different learning styles different

00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,720
mental modes different analogies

00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,130
different they might have different uses

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,020
for the code that you never even thought

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:11,180
of so they can come in and help you

00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,380
write your documentation from a whole

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,690
new perspective that you never even

00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,960
considered so I mean just needless to

00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,710
say it's really good to help others um

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:22,130
get involved in writing the

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,360
documentation so you know the let's flip

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,190
that around for a second and let's say

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,930
if you're reading somebody else's

00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,970
documentation you go to see pan you find

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,630
some great library some code that you

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,760
want to use you

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,930
start reading through the documentation

00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,130
and you find yourself scratching your

00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,650
head and you're saying well this is

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:39,260
confusing I'm having a hard time getting

00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:41,180
through this document take that big red

00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,390
flag make yourself a note and say this

00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:46,610
is hard difficult in appropriate

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,990
documentation and then once you get

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,000
through that once you figure out how to

00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,190
use that tool you're trying to use go

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,020
back if you have the time and clean up

00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,940
that documentation go back and fill in

00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,860
the gaps that you found say to yourself

00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,180
well what was missing from this document

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,550
that could have made my life easier and

00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:04,939
go in and just add that and send the

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:06,770
author a patch and you know if you're

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:09,800
the author make it easy for people to

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:11,030
send those patches the the tool that I

00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,250
really like and you know I'm sure a lot

00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:16,040
of others do as well as github you know

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,750
it makes it so easy just to quickly make

00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,280
your changes throw in a pull request and

00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,750
then you know wash your hands and not

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,760
have to worry about putting the other

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,550
patch emailing them and following up and

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,050
so just try to make it really easy to

00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,820
invite others to contribute to your

00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,950
documentation but similarly you know

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,630
don't be don't be intimidated about

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:37,310
jumping in and helping with other

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:39,080
people's documentation um visit I know I

00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,220
remember back when I first started

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,720
writing pearl and I would come across

00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,520
these big large frameworks and I'd say

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,770
to myself well I don't know enough to

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,940
contribute to that I'm not an expert on

00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,380
this they're the experts I'm going to

00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,600
trust that their documentation is good

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,430
enough but that's not always true and I

00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,110
don't think that's always fair so even

00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:57,020
if you think that your contributions

00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:59,120
might not be the best possible send them

00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,620
anyway right um anyway if there's any

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,120
deficiencies in the stuff that you

00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,530
submit or the stuff that you send I

00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,450
guarantee you the author's going to go

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,740
in and clean it up and tweak it and do

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,810
what they need to do to make it more

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,400
suitable but that was the good catalyst

00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:12,680
a good starting point the push that that

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,110
author needed to clean up those mistakes

00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:18,460
or to expand the documentation to make

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:21,860
it more useful to a wider audience so um

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:29,200
yes I guess that's all I got any any

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:29,200
questions alright well oh I'm sorry

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,100
yeah absolutely and I do that at work

00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,470
every day well not every day but often

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,420
actually I'll write my pod and then I'll

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,240
use one of those pods simple plugins to

00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,070
take that pod and turn it into a wiki

00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,750
format and now just copy and paste and

00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,630
drop it right into our work wiki so that

00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:00,360
way we constantly have a wiki over here

00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,740
that the less technical people are more

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,900
comfortable getting in and jumping into

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,870
and then we also have our pod in our and

00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:14,820
our git repository so yeah absolutely

00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:16,950
that's a good question I don't know

00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,530
offhand but if nobody's written that yet

00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,450
i'm sure you know i'm sure it shouldn't

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,160
be too difficult to do i mean basically

00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,840
it up to start with a wiki parser and

00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,670
then pot is really simple so you can

00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,610
easily format once you have that parse

00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:34,830
that's easy enough to format into pod so

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:37,620
yeah it's definitely reasonable any

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,940
other questions all right well thank you

00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,830
and thanks again for your patience with

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,340
my computer and aptitude at the

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,340
