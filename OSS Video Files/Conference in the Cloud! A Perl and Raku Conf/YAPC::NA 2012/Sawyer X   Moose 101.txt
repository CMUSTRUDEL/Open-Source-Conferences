00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,760

girls I'm sorry you do you want to start

00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:58,199
I'm i usually well in Hebrew we have

00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:01,230
when we talk we actually need to use

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,940
words that indicate female or male and I

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,769
always write the male version with a

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,650
slash and female people get really mad

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,450
at it because I can have like entire

00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,670
paragraphs with what I just put it is

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,280
gender nonspecific everywhere in English

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,960
this like not my first language so often

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:22,110
times i just say guys without noticing

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,369
and I seriously apologize y'all alright

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,869

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,950
going to correct me that's not the way

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:31,350

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:45,119
with everyone all right does anyone have

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:49,710
any questions before I start or specific

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:56,009

comfortable how many of you right

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,329
modules using like how many of you right

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,229
objects object-oriented all right all

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:13,550
right this is good okay how many of you

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:15,620
have used moose all right

00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,030
we're good that's good then you are the

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,910
people I want to talk to you this is

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,610
good you're in the right place I'm not

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:25,190
going to kid get very advanced so I'm

00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,710
sorry because I do want this to be a

00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,110
completely 101 talk where everyone could

00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:33,320
just after you see this you just go and

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,030
you just write something so i do

00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,180
apologize to anyone who knows what this

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,490
is about and knows how it's done and

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:45,860
won't won't get that much out of it

00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:48,290
maybe it'll be fun let's hope okay well

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,510
i think i think we can start i'm going

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,010
to run this pretty fast so if i move

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,170
along too fast you're going to have to

00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,720
stop me because otherwise i won't i have

00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:00,350
no indication whether i'm going faster

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,360
not accept my time so you're going to

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,510
have to help me out in case I go too

00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,130
fast because I really tend to do that

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,840
also if you can't hear me because I

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,690
probably won't be standing here I really

00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,330
hate just standing all the time I have

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,620
to move around and if that's if you

00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,900
can't hear me just you have to let me

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:23,959
know so I get back to the podium okay we

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:26,030
got a deal all right good okay so this

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,640
is the loose talk I'm Sawyer and let's

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,140
start I should probably say a few things

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,480
about myself because not a lot of people

00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,620
here know me some people here do moutain

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,860
dew know me and that's kind of scary

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:39,230
because I haven't met them before I'm

00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,970
sorry I'm my name is not saw your ex

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,650
that's like two names alright that's a

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,330
first name last name you don't have to

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,660
refer me soy your ex you can just say so

00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:49,120
and i have a blog and blogs / law why

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,650
you saying I when used parole I have a

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,010
sip an author so I'm on search deeper in

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,660
manistee pan I have a github page

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,910
everyone he refers to me as the danger

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,450
guy you can you can do that at school I

00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:06,170
worked on a lot of projects most notably

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:08,450
dancer I'm the container module starter

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,570
which actually picked up from Andy we

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:14,130
did an amazing job along with Ricardo

00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:17,040
and a few others i wrote mantasy panic

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,470
and there's a really really cool role

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,880
called mu sex-role luggable and I wrote

00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,320
that one I think you should use it and

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,060
if you don't know why just ask me

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,220
afterwards or if I have time I'll do

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:31,050
that I don't always go TFC but when I do

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,590
I talk about news now I was looking at

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,150
the attendance list and I noticed

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:40,020
someone who's actually not here because

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,610
he screwed me over when I saw him on the

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,610
attendees latest I was like I have to I

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:48,210
have to add a slide I'd always talk

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,850
about moose but when I do even little as

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,710
president road news unfortunate Steven

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,520
little is not present and I will file a

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:58,200
complaint all right so what is moose

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,990
basically it's an object system it

00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,000
provides objects that's about it it's

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:07,680
meant a class-based which is a fairly

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,450
advanced sophisticated feature and that

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,430
basically means that if you have objects

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,800
you have definitions for those objects

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,900
as a layer under it and you can change

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,540
that layer and change the way objects

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,920
actually work she's really advanced

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,370
we're not going to get to that but it's

00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:26,250
possible most itself is very fancy has a

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,750
lot of really good features basically a

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:32,700
cherry picked from all the best

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:34,530
languages HP not included and it has a

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,030
lot of really good pictures it's also

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,270
very sophisticated which is different

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,850
where it is really smart in the way that

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,560
it does things and it's really community

00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,210
infused in the way that it learns from

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,970
the community what the community uses

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,660
what it does and then adjust adjust

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,340
itself to provide easier ways for the

00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,280
community to do what it actually does in

00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,200
terms of conventions it's also very

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,560
extensible meaning that you can extend

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,050
pretty much most parts of it you can

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,880
write a lot of plugins for it it lets

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,030
you play with the objects the matter of

00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,680
the traits it's really cool hey most of

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,010
all its production ready most words been

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,940
in a while ago it's been used on fairly

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:18,060
insane number of

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,340
Systems production-based whether it's

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,710
web applications financials everything

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,950
its production ready it's good it's

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,810
really good you should use it so why

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,540
moves really you don't have to read this

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,450
it shouldn't really be able to on the

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:37,650
left side you can see a regular

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:40,200
application for a regular objects

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:44,520
implementation profile and on the right

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:46,560
you see moose so is that okay you get it

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,050
suppose you don't I'll just continue on

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,610
okay if you do you can you can just look

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,770
if you want with it let's say we

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,360
continue how do you write object in

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,520
basic profile you start with a reference

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,050
and it's usually to a hash because well

00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,810
you can do to an era a or something like

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,400
that basal very useful and you connect

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,290
the package to it using blessed which

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,790
basically hooks them up together and

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,950
said if you do something to this

00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,720
reference you actually go and look for

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:12,120
that in that namespace in the package

00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,280
and it provided the venue right

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,350
subroutines that provide the attributes

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,110
they have like a sub name it gets the

00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:21,300
values it looks into the hash key and

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,640
puts it in there and checks whatever and

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,070
you have to Erica Tara took the hell out

00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:29,640
of it I curse a lot i'm sorry i don't

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:31,830
really notice it so you really have to

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,760
check the hell out of that need like

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,120
didn't give me the right parameters

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:39,290
should this be business valid should

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,390
this be required is this not required

00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:45,840
really annoying and I'll give you an

00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:48,480
example package dog we use strict use

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,000
warnings it's on one line 430 because I

00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:55,080
wanted to be big enough sub new my class

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,900
right when you write dog arrow new you

00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:02,580
actually run dog new and send it the

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:08,310
word dog as the first parameter you do a

00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:11,460
bless anonymous hash and that returns

00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:13,560
the same hash but blessed and I can just

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:19,260
return that to the user that there we go

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:20,820
that's it is that cool with everyone so

00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,919
some issues first of all you have to

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,300
define a new every single time that

00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,740
means if you create a new object you

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,390
copy that new that you have and you

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,730
along with time is

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,800
back up some ways of doing this new

00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,660
method with error checking and all the

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,720
stuff and you have to copy it all the

00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,430
time to the new location I do my example

00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,960
doesn't even have parameters yet if I

00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,000
want to give it the name to a dog I

00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,800
can't do that it doesn't have default

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,240
values yet if I want to give the dog an

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:51,060
age which is zero because it was just

00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:52,890
born or initialized I can't do that we

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,660
still have to check everything manually

00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:58,830
which is really really really annoying

00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:01,470
maybe the age was like hello which

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:04,110
doesn't make a lot of things all right

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:06,690
so how do you do with me loose we start

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:10,260
with the package dog so far so good use

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:13,170
mousse and we're done that's pretty much

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,330
it so what we get first of all strict

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,910
and warnings on by default and this is

00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:20,130
what being community fused really means

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,860
strict in mornings is something we use

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,600
all the time beginner programmers forget

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,550
it and experienced programmers are sick

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,390
of writing it we should all be using it

00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:35,340
and it does that you get a new method

00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:37,440
automatically and well the hell with

00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,810
ponies we get a moose so who cares about

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,870
ponies right I actually found a few

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:45,750
pictures of moose playing soccer I'm not

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:48,450
kidding it's available but I couldn't

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,730
use them because of rights alright so

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:54,300
let's look at some full of forest

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,820
successors attribute i use the has key

00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,800
key word that i get when i use mousse i

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,780
suddenly have command called hands and

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,540
that command gives me the possibility to

00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,040
define new attributes so if i use has i

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,540
can give it whatever the name of that

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,730
rebutia is here i'm going to call that

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,800
rebuke name and then i'm going to set up

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,310
what kind of accessory is it is it a

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:21,540
read write one is it really only one yes

00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:23,460
thank you I'm sorry I can't do that but

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:27,620
i can tell you what it says there's has

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:30,870
name comma round brackets geez Reid

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:33,540
right that's what it said and that means

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,670
that i want to read write attribute that

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,580
means that now if i have a new I can

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,100
actually say name sky or whatever you

00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:44,140
want to call

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:47,020
dog and and in the process of using the

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,340
object I can actually run name again and

00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,260
give it a new value because it's a

00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,530
rewrite attribute I can still write to

00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:56,170
it new values if I want to so I'm able

00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,970
to use our oh as read only if I want to

00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,950
attribute that can initialize I cannot

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,000
change afterwards usually this is what

00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,210
you want you want to read only

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,790
attributes not sure ask me if we have

00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,650
time for questions in all 21 you can

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,340
manually change the setting get our via

00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:14,200
via writer or reader the options writer

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,870
or reader instead of like you have is

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,700
and that you add writer set name and

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,010
suddenly have a method that moose

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,170
creates called set name and it gives set

00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,330
name to send a new name instead of the

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,820
attribute name or you can use reader to

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:29,770
have get name and then to get the name

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:33,520
you don't call name you call cat named

00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:35,230
it creates the method for you attributes

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,060
can have defaults as we can have time

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,580
constraints they have trees they can be

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,900
lazy and builders clear answers a lot of

00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,690
things afterwards can do i'm going to go

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,430
over some of those then hopefully if

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,830
we'll have the time showing a good

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:50,320
example all right so type concentrates

00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:53,230
I'm going to knock it up a notch it's a

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,340
SD r is an option provides attack

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,650
concentrates and these tough

00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,420
concentrates are contained inside moves

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,370
they can reroute it they have a bunch of

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,220
those and they check for them there's

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,140
string in boolean internet password code

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,020
red projects actually checks forensics

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:13,300
and classes you can set up you can say

00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:14,710
is a animal thank you and suddenly you

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,320
will check that it's a class it's an

00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,270
object that is a class animal it's

00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,280
really useful you can combine them array

00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:24,010
ref part that's a Python which means or

00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,030
so return a ref or hash ref or it's in a

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:30,740
rep of strings and you can do in a right

00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:42,790
rivers my hatch opens yeah a little bit

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:48,500
yeah go ahead how about if we all right

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:51,440
well let's give it a try how's this can

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,930
you all see that all right good I'm

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,870
gonna read it anyway all right there's

00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,640
derivatives and in for example is an um

00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:02,000
it's basically a version of an um you

00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,770
can have a hierarchy there of something

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,030
that's based on something else you can

00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,800
create your own there is a subtype

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,690
command available on Lucy tool type

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,980
constraints and you can use that the

00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,020
subtype command you could be to create

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,460
your own commands like create your own a

00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:18,140
gnome that has a few specific

00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:21,440
possibilities all right methods methods

00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,820
are the same as you run them beforehand

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,530
you have a sub run you write whatever

00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:28,010
you want you have self and you close

00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:31,280
that one ok we're good inherence really

00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:33,560
easy package punk use mousse and I use

00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,270
the word extends extends all also comes

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,960
when i use moves i have hands i have

00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:41,950
extend there are a few more and the

00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:45,650
extent basically hates the inheritance

00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:48,500
connection that I have with person which

00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:50,960
says punk is a derivative of person it's

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,570
inherited inheritance from person that

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:58,310
means the same is like using the ISA and

00:13:53,570 --> 00:14:00,890
all that stuff they use yes it is

00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,230
allowed nice one all right Mulder

00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,330
enhances as possible extent gets an

00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,070
array you can use except array so if I

00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,380
have a package child use mousse they can

00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:11,270
do extends father and mother and I can

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:13,280
do that as many as I want you probably

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,100
don't want multiple inheritance what you

00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,050
do want is this role roles works as a

00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,570
composition instead of a tree of an

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:23,480
inheritance I'm not going to go through

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:25,100
what the difference is because better

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,160
people smarter people are able to

00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,560
explain it much more simply and

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,180
understandable than I do but if you

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,100
don't understand it or you really want

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,529
to know come and ask me and i hope i

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,379
don't really confuse you alright so i

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:41,709
can use the width and with what what it

00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:44,939
basically does what roles do is take a

00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:48,459
set of behavior and apply it to a class

00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:50,769
that means that tattoos piercings squad

00:14:48,459 --> 00:14:52,750
or whatever these are behaviors these

00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:56,470
are not classes you cannot do tattoos

00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,730
new so you might want to write an object

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,509
of tattoos you can do it like a new

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:03,939
tattoo but theoretically here tattoos is

00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:05,920
just behavior it can have it can have

00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:08,379
attributes and tone it can have methods

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,310
but that's it there is no new method for

00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:14,199
a role it's just behavior that a class

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,620
consumes and then you get that stuff

00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:20,110
which is better than keratins of course

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,759
roles this is the main line roles are

00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,620
things you do instead of things you are

00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,839
and that's a major difference between

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,649
inheritance and except getting more

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:34,779
behavior for that class yeah NP bro you

00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:37,600
can you can devote so you can well no

00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:39,250
it's a single namespace but well that's

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,139
a namespace collision this is not what

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,480
moose can't do with this is what like

00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:46,329
probably like your file system can do

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,100
you can't have two names with two files

00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:49,720
with the exact same path that are

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:55,149
different that the bus and will not

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:58,630
allow them so depositors neighbor if you

00:15:55,149 --> 00:16:05,529
can if they have different files but yes

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:09,639
you can you can subroutines maybe you

00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:11,920
define more attributes maybe tattoos has

00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:16,329
an attribute called num of tattoos

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,550
that's fine yeah you know any any other

00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:23,649
questions or at oh shoot isn't like an

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:26,329
interface yes trying to be sure in time

00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:28,999
brother p approach

00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:31,790
yeah Texas is a p.m. file like Fung's

00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:34,670
the PFR like persons up a pond with high

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,619
hooks hooks this are also called method

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,839
modified suppose I have a package user

00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:41,449
winterwear which is based off of a

00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:43,759
regular user and I want this user to

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:47,420
know about the winner be ready for it so

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:50,029
i can do before leaving leaving would be

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,129
a subroutine defined in user and I can

00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:54,049
use the before method which is before

00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:56,329
keyword which is also provided by moose

00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:59,540
to wrap up a subroutine that will run

00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:01,249
right before leaving will be run this

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,920
way I don't have to override users

00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:07,459
leaving method alright so i can do a

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,559
subroutine and anonymous everything here

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:12,529
and i can do a check for the cold

00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:14,630
attribute and then run d take jacket

00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:16,459
method and then whenever someone uses

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:20,000
when or where and it will call the user

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:21,439
base the base class is leaving method

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,139
I'm going to make sure that it does that

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,399
it's really cool I can do the same with

00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:28,700
a different ones but they have a user

00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:30,590
secure extends user and I have around

00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,149
which is really cool around wraps the

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,649
entire subroutine that can control

00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:36,320
whether it's going to be run any way at

00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:38,210
all so I can call subroutine I get my

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,760
original method over there so I can call

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,409
it if I want you and then I get self and

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,990
then run the security check if the

00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:47,330
security check boolean returns true I

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:51,159
can call the original method with

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:53,630
whatever parameters I got if not the

00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:56,090
original method which is called login

00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,289
will not get run that's really cool you

00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,139
can do a lot of really cool stuff with

00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:01,909
round there's before after around

00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:04,279
interop wind I'm not getting into an

00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:08,899
argument they're kind of insane rarely

00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:12,110
used more attributes so suppose I

00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:13,909
haven't repeat set up sorry i got is is

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,850
a default required lazy predicate clear

00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:18,270
or bill or I'm going to

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:22,470
don't worry let's start um default

00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:26,070
pretty basic right string number this is

00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:28,290
how you put a hash of air ear if I can

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,150
like have a whole sub routine there that

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,860
creates a new object for it it gives a

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,630
value that it is an object that's good

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,950
that's cool if you need a more elaborate

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,680
subroutine you should probably use

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:40,590
builder that is also an option I'm going

00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,930
to show we don't worry after we have two

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:45,440
required required this means that it's

00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:48,120
required this means that if you run new

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,340
without it it will actually fail and say

00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,560
this attribute needs a value on

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:54,780
initialize you have to provide a value

00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:01,170
and this is not required it's kind of

00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:03,800
obvious right all right lady that's how

00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:06,330
you make a lazy what lady means is that

00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,700
the class will not create the slots for

00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,440
this attribute unless it absolutely has

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,260
to and that is defined by whether it is

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,480
accessed at all that means if we have an

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,070
attribute whose value is a soccer team

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,110
they actually connect somewhere and

00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:22,020
someone runs the application without

00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:24,210
using that attribute it will not do it

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,370
if it's lazy it would only do it when

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,830
someone acts is it this is really really

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,080
really useful for example if you have a

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,300
database handler and someone runs your

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,740
command line application and they don't

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:39,090
use they don't need the database that

00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:40,860
will not get used and if you have a an

00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,930
application that uses database handler

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,790
but it uses it like 20 minutes after it

00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,050
starts you don't want to connect at the

00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,240
beginning of the applicant you want

00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,290
you're afraid to have a still handle you

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,200
wanted to connect whenever it is

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,670
actually used 20 minutes later so a lazy

00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:58,200
attributed will do that that's really

00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:59,880
cool no access no penalty so lazy is

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,050
good you should use lazy for almost

00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,450
everything that is calculated it's

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:05,450
really good for cash metrics yep shoot

00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:11,790
it will run it because if you need to

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,350
read it you need to get a valuable it's

00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:15,510
not on death it just does not have to

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,400
call you at all and that isn't value

00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:20,790
please it's not a positive it's how true

00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,290
value but it's a value there is a

00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:25,230
difference and you will see it all right

00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,730
builder built builder is the name

00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,650
the subroutine you just give it a name

00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,530
of a sub thing that you will create in

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:34,200
order to build this so it will run build

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,580
it and then you can use whatever inside

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,169
the something you can actually use the

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,450
object already even though it might be

00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:42,480
as part of creating the object which is

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:44,850
really really really cool so this is

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,990
really awesome and obviously after you

00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:51,450
build it they will come it works here

00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,220
this is awesome all right ah it is

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,340
really a workout like so sad about it

00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:59,549
Kevin Costner movie poster thin there

00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:01,530
feel like I don't get it all right clear

00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:04,080
a clear is the name of the subroutine

00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:07,440
that moves will create for you in order

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,240
to clear it so for example if I have a

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,429
subroutine call time machine I in

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,500
yourself and I can now call clear it

00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:16,049
because was created and what we'll do it

00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,630
will clear the value of the it attribute

00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:21,030
and you will not clear it to undeath it

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:24,630
will not clear to zero or empty it will

00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:26,250
it will have no value at all which is so

00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,470
much more different than a value of

00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,870
undeath so much differentiates between

00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:33,480
not having a value having a value that

00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:36,030
is false or only find in a way like zero

00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,530
on therefore empty string and having a

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,679
true value it sees the difference

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,210
between those it's really important why

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,070
so that clears the value it doesn't hurt

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,820
to default also because we have

00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:50,010
predicate and predicate is the matching

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,540
idea to clearer where you have you give

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,580
it a name of a subroutine moose will

00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,290
create that subroutine and then you can

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,350
use that in order to check if it has a

00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:00,299
value even if it's an undefined value on

00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:03,210
this even if it's a false value like

00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:05,880
zero it is a value and you can check

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:09,900
that using a predicate so it has it if

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:14,720
so do it all right any question about

00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,720
this no one you

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,929
the if check is using the predicate and

00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:30,620
the predicate can tell you if it's a

00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:35,360
value even if it's undef the has it is

00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:38,360
with even if it is the value of it is 0

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,580
or undeath that's so good i'm be a true

00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,610
value yeah if it's undef predicate it's

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,080
like the user game name on depth the

00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,029
predicate is going to say he gave it a

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,220
value it might not be false sucks for

00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:51,649
you but it's a value he walks your pin

00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:55,429
out sucks for you I'm just any witness

00:22:51,649 --> 00:23:02,270
vs. I'm definitely it's close but not

00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:05,539
yet predicate is as it gets a voluminous

00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:07,309
whatever it means he has a value even if

00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:10,399
it's a false film there is a value there

00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:13,100
there is something that was its kind of

00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:17,120
acquittal of church exists right exactly

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:19,399
thank you go awesome you guys are great

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,559
okay so he checks whether an attribute

00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:23,840
value exists even if it's a false value

00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:25,789
which is good all right commie can this

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,279
is an example we actually have time for

00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:30,350
this example so I wrote like a small

00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:31,909
school called come can just to give you

00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,620
an example of how things are done

00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:35,899
actually watered down a bit because I

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,890
wrote it like way too much and basically

00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:38,630
I was supposed to get like the

00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,610
theoretical Dogman figured maybe I'll

00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:43,399
give a practical talk but maybe i'll

00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:45,830
just get both so all right comic can

00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:47,090
it's like it's a hub for various comic

00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,890
strip so we're going to write this i'm

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,270
going to show you how it's written it

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,149
allows you to fetch different comic

00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:55,929
strips from whatever source you want and

00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:58,820
it has a standard uniform interface to

00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:00,380
to add more comics so if you have a new

00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,090
comic strip that you want you can add it

00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,010
to call me cam comic-con doesn't really

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,659
exist but you could apply kick if you go

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,730
you get uploaded depends i'm working on

00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:10,159
it and what we'll be using here for the

00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:12,320
examples our roles lazy attributes and

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,909
overriding attribute options i'm going

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,890
to show a few ways of how i do things

00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:18,080
with mousse which i think is right and

00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:22,760
if you have a problem like [ __ ] you guys

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:25,100
seriously if anyone knows me it's like

00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,530
i'm pretty flexible but i think things

00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,750
should be done right so if right like

00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:31,550
bad and up give me code

00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,620
getting tell you what's wrong with it

00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,150
all right all right I'm not gonna curse

00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,360
but I'm just going to tell you this is

00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:41,780
long all right and we're going to use

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,490
also attribute the predicate so how come

00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,680
you can how it looks like what the

00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,990
structure we have a user and this is I

00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,120
guess this is Kim we have the main

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,580
module use comic can PM the user is

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,550
going to use simply comma campion p.m.

00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,320
in order to get the comics all right so

00:24:55,550 --> 00:25:03,170
far so good we're going to have comic

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:05,630
modules which go to specific specific

00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:08,660
comics like XKCD penny arcade gilbert

00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:13,000
whatever and the main module is going to

00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:15,830
use those ok so far so good make sense

00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,560
also we're going to create an interface

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,780
for all of these modules so they stay

00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,760
uniform we're going to put it into a

00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,340
role we're going to call the roll call

00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:28,640
me can roll comic and then these will

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,320
use that role in order to have a uniform

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,630
interface maybe some default attributes

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,700
may be a default subroutine that they

00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,410
all want to share we're going to put in

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,850
here and then they're going to use it

00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,750
and they don't have to rewrite

00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:43,190
everything it's going to be very

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:46,010
refactored all right so let's look at it

00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:47,660
again p comic-con p.m. is going to be

00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,430
the users interface it's going to be a

00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,460
hub for whatever coming can't comic

00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,800
modules it has these are going to be

00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,470
object that actually fetch the comic

00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,260
strips okay each one will have a logic

00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,280
of how to get dad comic strip and

00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:03,980
they're getting have a common interface

00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,990
and it will be defined by the comma can

00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,280
roll coming okay it's going to be a role

00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:15,290
that's going to be the interface for all

00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:19,370
this so all right code let's see all

00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:22,820
right is that okay all right so i

00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:25,970
created here like a tree of basic Sipan

00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:28,520
stuff bill changelog there's an example

00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:33,320
here library and you can see there's

00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:35,510
comic can PM over here and there's comic

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,880
con directory with comics different

00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:40,160
comics for everything and a role here

00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,510
for these comics to use an interface

00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,029
there's a bunch of other files here I'm

00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,590
not going to

00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:46,619
the most of them don't really work all

00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:51,419
right if I go into lib there's comic an

00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:55,080
here and you can see here in the oh snap

00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:59,700
all right I'm trying my best not to

00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:04,049
curse it's really hard no this no I'm

00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:14,879
not assuming this works is that no

00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:18,239
that's worse wait holy [ __ ] okay that's

00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:24,359
a good idea which I don't think actually

00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:27,749
changes the let's try default all right

00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:30,269
is that good awesome all right so

00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:31,559
there's a package here right abstract

00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:33,419
use mousse underneath strict and

00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,859
warnings I use names for solder clean

00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,210
which is the basic module that keeps

00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:38,820
your environment clean that's always

00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:41,309
really important my mom oh instead so

00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:44,099
you have I use the different comics here

00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:47,070
so I can access them and I have a comic

00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:49,830
here at attribute that will hold

00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:54,479
whatever comic the user wants so it

00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:58,229
could actually run if I show you the

00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:59,729
example of how it's actually used this

00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:01,679
is how it's actually use I use gamma can

00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:03,299
and then i create a new comic can and i

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,269
give it a comic like i want you to give

00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:09,889
me XKCD and then I can use fetch on it

00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:13,499
all right that's a good usage okay so i

00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:15,269
have a comic here and you can see I set

00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:18,450
it to read only so you cannot change it

00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:21,119
afterwards and there's a string here

00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,279
it's amateur it's a string and that it's

00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:27,210
required that means if you do not give

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:29,489
it it will crash all right now there's

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,259
another attribute here called comic

00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:33,299
engine and that's going to be the class

00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:36,059
that i'm using the comic module that i'm

00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:37,859
using in order to get it okay it's going

00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,749
to be held in an attribute so i don't

00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:41,519
have to keep it in a scalar somewhere in

00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:43,559
the package I just I want to keep it an

00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,029
attribute so it's a read-only it's an

00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,830
object this amount of which object

00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:48,690
actually has a type concentrate called

00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:51,839
object just has to be a blessed

00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:53,429
reference and it's lazy that means that

00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,720
i want to calculate it whenever it's

00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:55,470
actually used I don't want just

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,510
calculating

00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:59,940
Vance I want to make sure they it's only

00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:02,070
created wings use and I have a builder

00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,720
for it call underscore build underscore

00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,429
comic on the score engine that's that's

00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,169
the methodology that we have like

00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:09,870
underscore build underscore name of

00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:11,340
attribute and I used handles here which

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,590
I haven't shown which handles actually

00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,690
proxies away this method this fetch

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:18,260
method that means they've the object

00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,760
that will be stored in this attribute

00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,640
has a fetch method I'm going to have it

00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:27,419
and people will be able to call

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:31,490
comic-con's fetch and reach by proxy the

00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:35,370
comic engine and that fetch is that ok i

00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:37,549
see a where you look over there would

00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:40,110
you like me to explain I can alright so

00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:42,809
you have the common can write that's the

00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:45,960
main module and you have the comic under

00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:49,919
it like XKCD comic right the xkcd comic

00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:53,159
has a fetch method now I want the user

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,440
not to do like comic an object go to the

00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:56,909
comic engine object and then run fetch

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,789
from that I don't want to keep writing

00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:02,309
to get to the actual fetch method so I'm

00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:05,039
using handles which comes in Moose

00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:06,720
attributes which says this attribute is

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,179
an object and it has a fetch method I

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,130
want to have that method so he creates a

00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:14,640
fetch method in comic can which will

00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:16,919
actually run the fetch method in that

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,470
attribute object is that ok alright cool

00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,150
I have arguments for it so if the user

00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:23,190
want to say I'm going to give arguments

00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:25,590
to the engine itself because XKCD has a

00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:28,559
different feature and I want to throw it

00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:30,870
in there like a sink or whatever I can

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,520
have that I've said it as an error a ref

00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,620
and I have like an empty array breath so

00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:39,179
we have some kind of irate value already

00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:40,919
in in it then I write the build method

00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:43,200
which is basically itself and then i

00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,510
have a class which are you creating like

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,240
the namespace and then when you and i

00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:50,220
give it the comic engine hearts now this

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,870
is this will always work because what

00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,820
did these are provided one or not i

00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,169
provide one that is empty so basically

00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,030
if there's a provider one it will give

00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:59,059
it if not it will give it just just

00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:01,650
throw an empty list in there that's ok

00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:03,150
the make immutable meta make immutable

00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,620
you don't have to remember that but when

00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,120
you start using mousse people will

00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,440
advise you on doing that it will just

00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:11,850
make things faster all right

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,460
it's not required though it's just like

00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:18,330
namespace auto clean it's really good

00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:20,460
let's look at how we roll is defined so

00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,320
this is how role is defined this is the

00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,230
interface the role that comes specific

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,210
comics app I use mousse roll instead of

00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:29,280
moose in order to say this is the type

00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:32,130
this is a bunch of behaviors but you

00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,900
cannot do a new here so I use that one

00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:36,780
and you can see that I set up a comic

00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:41,700
URL which is a required string this

00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:44,970
thing says this gives whoever consumes

00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:48,270
this role another attribute without them

00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:51,510
defining it which means if I create a

00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:53,760
comic module and I do with role comic

00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:56,610
suddenly i have a new attribute called

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,470
comic URL and this is like to give the

00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,090
original URL for where the comic is like

00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:03,360
the official URL I just I needed

00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:05,640
something under requires here says if

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,870
you're going to use me like this role

00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,760
you're going to have to have a

00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,050
subroutine a specific method you're

00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,570
going to have to have a method called

00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:15,360
fetch this is my way of making sure that

00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:18,180
whoever uses this role has that correct

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,300
method that is defined as our interface

00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:24,480
it will crash if i have a new moves

00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:26,850
object and i use with comic can enroll

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,040
comic and i do not provide a fetch

00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:32,040
method it will simply crash this role

00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:36,080
requires you to have it alright moving

00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:39,000
on give you an example of a comic object

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,880
this is how it looks we have an XKCD

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,110
comic use mousse www XKCD it exists I

00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:48,090
wrote it I was bored I do with comic and

00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:55,170
roll comic which gives me two things

00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:58,260
first of all it makes sure it makes sure

00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:01,110
that I have a fetch method so it

00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:05,940
conforms me to some interface and it

00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:08,880
gives me the comic URL okay and what I

00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:11,640
do here I haven't show this I use the

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,620
plus your to say i know i have an

00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,780
attribute here I know because I got it

00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,090
from the role and I want to override

00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,100
something in it I want to just change a

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,340
specific option in so i changed the

00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:25,039
default in it

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:26,870
alright this is the way of for me to

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,840
make sure that for example if you'll see

00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:32,179
here that this comic URL is required

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,950
that means if I will not override and

00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:36,860
give it a default and the user will not

00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:39,710
provide it it's going to pass this is

00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:49,100
another way for me to enforce a specific

00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:51,730
uniform interface no but requires will

00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:55,129
will be ok because there is a default

00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:56,720
all right this isn't like this is a good

00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:59,000
way to make sure that if you're writing

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,529
a system where users add plugins for you

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,210
you just giving them as role you say

00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:04,340
just use that one and then you make sure

00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:25,220
that they set up different attributes

00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:26,960
correctly what do you mean no but what

00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,040
if a user uses it and then I want to

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,230
give it a default because they forgot

00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:36,020
about it you want to put is required to

00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:37,550
say I want to make sure you do this it's

00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,079
got a default because I wrote in or what

00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:41,450
I'm doing maybe a different user is new

00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:45,260
to it he didn't give it a value the

00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:46,940
required will make sure that they do you

00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,470
can do the required here but then what

00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,200
if we have a user's it doesn't want to

00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:53,720
add the required why make it easier add

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,730
the required each time I just put it in

00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:00,470
the interface that's it all right

00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,970
there's a fetcher I'm sorry there's a

00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,290
fetcher object here which is basically

00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,880
the object i'm going to use in order to

00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,339
get that because i'm not going to write

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,690
a whole fetcher for XKCD again so i give

00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:11,690
it a method called build fetcher and

00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:15,079
then there's like a new XKCD object then

00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:16,940
i have the sub fetch which runs the

00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,770
fetchers fetch I can handle I can use

00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:22,010
handles there to see this is the point

00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:25,640
of the handles ma'am is that okay

00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:28,100
I'm sorry the you see here they have a

00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,950
fetcher attribute which is an object and

00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:34,280
I have to call the pitcher to get there

00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:37,160
and then i have to call his fetch right

00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,720
makes sense this is this is why i had

00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,960
candles in the beginning so i want to

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,550
have the user do this each time get to

00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,480
the attribute and from there to the

00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:49,310
method so i get it i call it i return

00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,990
that's it this is the entire program all

00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:55,070
right let's see what else I got because

00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:58,640
we're running out of time this reg ex

00:35:55,070 --> 00:36:03,590
works I tested it it works on mo mu

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:05,480
mouse and moose some people use or look

00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:07,850
at the different modules and they want

00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:12,050
to know what the difference is so moose

00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:17,450
is the standard one Mouse is a subset of

00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:19,370
it a fairly extensive accessible subset

00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,890
but a subset he was success in it's

00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:24,440
faster if you're using miles we should

00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:26,840
probably use any moves which said use

00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,520
mouse unless moose is already loaded and

00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,560
then you have an application that if you

00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,240
don't use mousse specifically anywhere

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,640
it will use mouth which will be faster

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,520
but if you have move somewhere will just

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,640
run on most it's already loaded there's

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,980
new movies purer coral completely it is

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:47,750
substantive moose and its really really

00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:50,180
really really fast no it's but it's a

00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:52,370
much smaller subset subset take into

00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,950
account Lee works a bit different it's

00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:56,840
compatible mo is as little as possible

00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:58,010
including the character account you

00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:03,920
should look at the source it's just like

00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:05,540
a single line of [ __ ] and and it was I

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,240
think it was a joke I don't some people

00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,680
use it and there's M which really is as

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,920
little as possible i think it has like

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,910
the package definition vetted so

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,910
everyone is an example and there's

00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:23,120
homeless which is actually incompatible

00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:25,430
chickpeas face right so i don't always

00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,960
need a metaclass based postmodern

00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:28,340
introspecting pluggable object system

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,930
for profile with eternal type

00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,520
concentrates and roll support and a

00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:34,630
fluffy pony if you know what I mean with

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:43,029
Queen just kidding bhavana you

00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:44,859
I just lose thank you right we have one

00:37:43,029 --> 00:37:48,099
minute I think does anyone know the

00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:52,299
schedule these are like two minutes ten

00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:53,920
minutes awesome all right ah the if you

00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:56,230
know what I'm talking about wink wink I

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,690
have no idea what that means like it

00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:00,099
really i'm not talking about anything if

00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,589
anyone thought it was like a reference

00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:05,259
to something it isn't all right

00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:07,809
questions we have time I can explain the

00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:09,190
code I can answer other stuff i can give

00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:15,880
you a homeless recipe if you really want

00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:19,049
one shoot what sure sure I can do that

00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,049
where would you like me to post a cup

00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:23,980
we're just give it to me I'll coffee at

00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:26,049
everyone else wanted just let me know

00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,819
found what's wants to write it you can

00:38:26,049 --> 00:38:29,769
write it that's really cool there's

00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:31,720
already a basic framework for that any

00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:32,829
other questions anything you're not sure

00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,440
about anything you're worried about

00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:40,980
everything anything if you need like I

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,980
don't know help with stuff yeah

00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:50,710
metaclass first of all type constraints

00:38:48,789 --> 00:38:52,599
you don't have top conference you can do

00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:55,000
in isn't and provide a subroutine and

00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:56,559
that's how between will be run when it

00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,420
checks for the value so you can do a

00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:02,589
subroutine and then check is it like a

00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:04,720
digit if not I'll die and do that thing

00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:07,269
in that that's the only type concert

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,759
that you have so the whole time comes we

00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:11,890
think the metaclass thing attribute

00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:13,630
traits do not exist which are really

00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,430
advanced feature I know if you know that

00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,809
one so there's a bunch of those that

00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,880
don't exist but it's really really

00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:22,720
really fascinates real pro chicken fat

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,690
package along with a whatever you're

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,700
using and that's really useful you can

00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:31,089
embedded whatever it's actually

00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:34,650
relatively small and it was written by a

00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:44,500
chord developer of moose driven by MST

00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:49,100
next one next to even shoot oh [ __ ] um

00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:51,710
I think it was writers what yeah I think

00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:54,050
it requires like 588 or something but

00:39:51,710 --> 00:40:00,530
I'd oh my god it's like what are you

00:39:54,050 --> 00:40:03,200
using now Red Hat what are right okay

00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:05,150
look what my mind's Manhattan anyways so

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,930
they use like my baby right but you have

00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:10,490
enough six where they have like 5 10 oh

00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:14,000
my god I think they're like threw a

00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:15,410
party for you or something right

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:21,020
everyone was searching from right hand

00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:23,000
we also we started anyone else at some

00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:29,210
point probably 5a will be deprecated oh

00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:37,640
you think it's funny yeah all right 91

00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:39,950
88 lucky you well the proles kept keep

00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:44,210
getting better so if I could use like

00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:46,490
the latest i would i use i think 588 on

00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:51,470
some production systems and others i

00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:54,710
have 5 14 to fabian for the win well

00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:56,270
we're going to actually I don't have any

00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,490
specific recommendation other than

00:40:56,270 --> 00:41:00,710
features that are in pro like there were

00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:03,200
a lot of fixes and roll so for that

00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:06,170
reason you probably want to get a better

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,740
version if you can if you can move sucks

00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:11,210
to be you what else yeah like I'm just

00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:17,030
doing that whose clothes you're going

00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:20,030
down right penalty that's a good

00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:21,980
question no one asset except you two

00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:24,980
points for you you you all guys lose one

00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:27,610
point the women as well as just in say

00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:31,100
guys I'm sorry you lose a point on both

00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:34,310
that's rule penalty moose has a penalty

00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:36,290
for compile-time that means when you

00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:38,810
just run it and goes into the compile

00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:41,870
phase of pearl that compile time is

00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:44,630
going to set you back on moose I'd say

00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:47,900
about one well not even a second it's I

00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:50,240
think 0.7 on my machine I have like a

00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,520
crappy laptop so it might be one and a

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,280
crappier it might be easier from five it

00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,960
depends on what you're in which is

00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,370
really reduced from where it was people

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,080
kept talking about the penalty and moves

00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:02,630
but nowadays it doesn't exist as much as

00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:05,120
it did before so if you're ready like an

00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:07,610
application that has to go up and stay

00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:10,700
up for more than 23 seconds it's well

00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:12,860
worth it I think and if you want

00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,570
something that's really complicated or

00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,040
at least very satisfying in the

00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:19,790
environment that you get that's really

00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:22,010
useful and that's why I have this slide

00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:25,510
because if I want like really good stuff

00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:28,010
everyone a good ground I use mousse

00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:30,740
runner felting is relatively small i

00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:33,290
think i think it is relatively small and

00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:35,900
the packet like the meta thing what you

00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:37,820
do is you call packages meta and from

00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,920
there you call make immutable and you

00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,330
can more about that the awesome manuals

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,220
that moose hat have like one of the best

00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,870
documentation I've ever seen any

00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:47,240
explains there what it does is in line

00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:49,670
some of the things right into the object

00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,560
that cannot be changed later that means

00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:54,290
that you once you have the definition

00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,760
for the object for example and you want

00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:57,860
to say well I just want to add another

00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,290
attribute now even after it created the

00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,810
object you can do that moves but if you

00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:05,450
in line it you can't usually you don't

00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:07,340
do this right you find the [ __ ] you want

00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:09,350
you don't like outside another attribute

00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:11,270
what we're running so it doesn't happen

00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:15,440
too much and then becomes much faster

00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:19,570
much faster that's why that's why it's

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,570
useful to have that line yeah yeah

00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:26,480
anything else shoot

00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,190
go do something drive as far as I can

00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,119
see there's a lot of dark magic they

00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:33,829
have happening down right well it's not

00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:36,970
like [ __ ] me I wouldn't say it's dark

00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:39,470
magic but let's say darker corners and

00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:43,310
they were really good coat they were

00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:48,339
really really really good coat um I use

00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:50,780
nyt prop develoment a prof i use Prince

00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:52,430
I'm old school like that like nine gb

00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:54,530
old school but just like French it out

00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,359
all the everywhere and I had that really

00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,310
really useful for me I don't I never

00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:00,320
needed like a serious debugger for it

00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:02,300
and I'm pretty sure in like you prop

00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,980
will help you understand where things go

00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,190
when you need them sometimes like if you

00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:08,960
want to catch performance pretty good

00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:12,490
under using special tools maybe others

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,490
do sir

00:44:28,509 --> 00:44:34,609
what making a boat does not trouble you

00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:36,710
when you want to run have users add

00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:39,470
stuff what it actually means is once the

00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:41,630
object is initialized once you created a

00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:44,029
new object that's it that's the object

00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:46,220
like you can change the values of things

00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:48,680
but you kinda like you have a name and

00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,299
you create a new dog object with and you

00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,739
say well this object is missing

00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:53,509
something I'm going to just die hang

00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:54,710
with me and another new attribute

00:44:53,509 --> 00:44:56,809
definition to it you can't do that with

00:44:54,710 --> 00:45:00,289
immutable but how often do you do that

00:44:56,809 --> 00:45:01,279
which is pretty much never though so it

00:45:00,289 --> 00:45:02,569
doesn't trouble you and they go to

00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:05,769
subclass it they're going to push

00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:10,039
another roland do whatever they want

00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:11,569
anything else i did not cover or that

00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:13,489
you were wondering about don't feel shy

00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:17,960
I'm like I got nothing to do for the

00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:21,440
next four minutes anyway yeah alright

00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,809
cool so I wrote this module I'm gonna

00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,420
totally plug the [ __ ] out of it I I

00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:30,140
release module called moose acts like

00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:32,119
the Moose x namespace has a bunch of

00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,970
cool stuff really really cool stuff that

00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,799
you can just push into your code and use

00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:39,549
them it's really really really really

00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:45,230
really really really useful for example

00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:47,690
mm-hmm most x sorry mousex simple config

00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:49,339
which allows you to then the this guy

00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:54,049
actually finished the talk right down

00:45:49,339 --> 00:45:56,989
the hall so you can have for example a

00:45:54,049 --> 00:46:01,670
configuration file over there yeah and

00:45:56,989 --> 00:46:04,249
then in your class and suddenly the

00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:06,109
attribute that you can thing are we are

00:46:04,249 --> 00:46:09,339
red automatically from this

00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:12,589
configuration file and put in here

00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:15,380
automatically it's incredible so I wrote

00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:17,869
something else called mu sex-role

00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:22,489
luggable and what it does is give you a

00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:26,380
logging system really really simply and

00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:28,450
easily and you just do with move

00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,100
laudable and suddenly you can do stuff

00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:32,080
like set prefects for a certain

00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,510
subroutine as part of an output or log

00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:36,280
log debug which logs that you both

00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:39,730
fighting on you get the debug flag

00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:41,320
attribute you can do clear perfect

00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:47,940
summer there you can do a lot of stuff

00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:50,320
with it and you get like support for

00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,510
syslog you get support for output two

00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:55,540
standard errors and how to files to do

00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:57,430
like everything you can imagine

00:46:55,540 --> 00:47:00,820
basically because I just hooked that up

00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:02,920
to log dispatch yoli which is a really

00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:06,190
good module this is actually you should

00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:09,400
learn how to use it here ricardo vote it

00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:12,670
so I don't need really say more but you

00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:16,650
can create you can write lock with it in

00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:19,900
law stuff and log using a debug

00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:22,750
attribute here and lock fail we spas and

00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:24,850
died and when you use mousex roll

00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:28,000
lockable you just get all this inside

00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:29,950
your class automatically you get a debug

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,680
flag like an attribute that you can set

00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:36,850
which is a boolean you have all these

00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:38,950
methods and it sets the ident for syslog

00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:43,540
whoever knows that way it says Dharma

00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:46,900
according to your package so really cool

00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:48,460
you should use that that's it i think

00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,200
maybe one more question if someone has

00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:56,200
it and then i'll just let you leave

00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:59,910
wherever you need to get to yes no i

00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:03,190
never use eclair should be present it I

00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:04,990
think mousex declare if anyone is not

00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:09,340
familiar with it it's really really

00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:11,770
sugary syntax that uses like really

00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:15,160
advanced pearl stuff it really looks

00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:17,230
fantastic I like pro prole like I like

00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,270
this the way it is right now and mousex

00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:20,770
declare has too much of a penalty for me

00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:22,600
if you didn't have a penalty like the

00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:25,690
way it does it have like a series series

00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:29,320
cannot be fully compile compile time

00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:30,940
it's like it's like I don't know it's

00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,280
like someone bothering you while your

00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:35,110
work and just move away and take steer

00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,140
all your time and then the all right did

00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:40,380
what everyone yeah

00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:43,110
I don't like it but if you do I'll

00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:45,420
apology you leave yeah I don't like it I

00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:51,810
myself I could say one thing about that

00:48:45,420 --> 00:49:06,810
if you use mousex declare I'll just

00:48:51,810 --> 00:49:17,880
throw something at you this pulls in way

00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:19,860
of doing men signatures yeah yeah you

00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,640
can if you like the method signatures

00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:29,970
you can just use there's actually

00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:33,780
signatures even there's this which just

00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:55,020
gives you signatures or think method

00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:57,300
signatures Oh modifiers problem with the

00:49:55,020 --> 00:50:01,010
baby sister does it is the error

00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,010
messages you get from having signature

00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:16,820
