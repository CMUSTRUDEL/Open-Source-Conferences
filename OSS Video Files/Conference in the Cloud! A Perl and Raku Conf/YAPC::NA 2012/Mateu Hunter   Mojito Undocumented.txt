documented mostly motivation case you

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,890
might finally useful so I'm the tail

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,769
hunter I work for campus explorer and

00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:24,390
home base is Missoula Montana and if

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,689
this is streaming I give a shout out to

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:37,320
the people in the corporate office and

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:43,200
those in cyber land okay so to get this

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:47,129
thing going you need a get you need

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,329
[ __ ] or dbm deep as your data store so

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,890
I'm going through the prerequisites here

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:54,930
at about 30 different Sipan modules the

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,870
configuration files real basic is just a

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,850
hash hash raft you need at least to say

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,829
what your static URL is so where your

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,799
CSS or javascript is going to be located

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,600
and you need to say where they get repo

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,180
is because this will store your

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,909
documents in and get repo and it has a

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:16,650
dual back in to get repo and then the

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:18,030
Mongol or DB md or the Ashraf page

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,659
structures stored I'll show in a moment

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,110
and you can specify specify between two

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,490
different documents storages there's

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,810
[ __ ] which i've been using and you know

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,820
mongols not the greatest thing for

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,590
everybody so i said well let's throw

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,619
another backend option into the equation

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:41,670
and played around with DB md which is

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:42,840
interesting if not slow ok so talk a

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,060
little bit about back in how does that

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,110
delegation take place of sitting here

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,600
I'm thinking how am I going to you know

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,790
delegate to one of these two backends if

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,560
i put the document storage type in the

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,810
configuration file then i basically use

00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:01,290
that to load the proper back end so

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:04,740
you'll see down below here that this is

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,719
using the typical mu or moose delegation

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,440
so it has an editor the editor has some

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,680
handles and it's built then during

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,769
object construction in the build routine

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,299
you get both in moves to move at that

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:20,670
point it just says what's what's the

00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:23,069
name from the configuration if it's

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:28,769
mongrel is no demand go back in if it's

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:32,609
the DB md use that okay so what does the

00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:34,079
page look like from a dump this is

00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:35,819
actually the skeleton dump that will be

00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:37,739
added to dated printer super cool module

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,150
i'm glad i found about about it but this

00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,280
is actually from data skeleton which I

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,829
wrote around Halloween and so us think

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,900
of a name I mean I just want to see the

00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:49,169
keys not the values on these deeper data

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,730
structures this isn't that deep but it

00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,989
is so soon enough though data printer

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,049
will have this is an option to be able

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:59,010
to just print your keys in an

00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:00,599
arbitrarily deep structure the the

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,219
design on this what I want to do I

00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,150
borrowed a lot from mojo mojo so I

00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:08,010
worked on mojo mojo bit and this project

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,750
really came out of the need for notes I

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,510
had old antiquated note system where at

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,669
right personal notes just maybe back out

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,439
a code snippet get start writing you

00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:18,720
know if you kind of had a block and you

00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,709
want to achieve something just start

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,150
writing some notes a little bit of

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:22,919
literate programming or just a little

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,199
bit of get the brain flowing so this

00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,549
note sitam this is the version 2 I said

00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:30,269
let me borrow some the things from mojo

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:31,979
mojo one of the things mojo mojo lacked

00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:35,250
in my opinion was you were stuck with

00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:37,049
one format for your entire site so you

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,470
either had marked down or you had

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,810
textile and you know at the time I

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,280
prefer textile my buddy liked markdown

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,500
and so we are battling it's like why

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,989
should we battle so let's just give the

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,569
user choice so the way the choice is

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:53,879
incorporated is through sections seeing

00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:56,159
a mojito document that you can have

00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:00,019
markup of different flavors in the same

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:04,169
document so that's part of the nested

00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:06,599
nested feature so sections sections will

00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:08,519
have a class to them and that class to

00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,109
say what Neil is it markdowns a textile

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,409
is it something maybe I just want to

00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:12,409
highlight

00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:22,990
okay see that delegation again behind

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,880
the scenes there's this page object that

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,200
will delegate to the parser when I need

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,990
to parse the stuff from the page that

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,150
you've written or delegate to the render

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,880
when I want to turn that mark down into

00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,620
HTML and in page cred which is going to

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,450
read the things from the data store or

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,890
write them to the datastore so

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:44,860
delegation for me has worked pretty well

00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:47,170
when you're designing API alright so

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,910
I've got this data you know user mom

00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,300
going to be is no SQL right but it

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:56,860
doesn't mean schema schema less that's I

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:59,290
take a false statement to to believe so

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:02,590
you do have to keep track of your schema

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,030
if you're you know semi serious about it

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,130
and you can actually validate your

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,970
skimmer using data schema this is class

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:14,230
came across and you'll see in there the

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:16,390
the sections which I've got sx yes those

00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,490
have to be an array of hash rests with

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:22,000
the required keys of content in class

00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,800
and then the mojito definition further

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,660
down about midway that's going to be a

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,700
hash with derived acquired key of

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:32,620
sections which I previously defined as

00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:35,410
those sx accept this and it has some

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,080
other attributes to that data schema and

00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:42,370
then you just called es validator to see

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,540
if a mojito page actually matches up

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,100
with that scheme so I thought that was

00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,650
fairly nice i run this just in one of my

00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,950
tests that test suite so if i do change

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:55,360
this game i'll kind of known all right

00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:56,560
so mojito markup really I've sitting are

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,630
sticking ok how do I want to this I want

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,480
this to be short again I'll moja moja

00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:04,390
we're talking about how to do you know

00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,910
we called plugins or filters or share

00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,890
home in this case I wanted identify

00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,890
section and I was going to use HTML

00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,780
section HDMI final section so my short

00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,990
is sx so you can have kind of fun with

00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,960
that and it's two letters to type so

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:21,550
short easy type and then the dot

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,110
whatever that could be marked down that

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,010
could be textile that could be pearl if

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,010
I want to highlight it

00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:33,870
as we'll see now this mojito actually

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,580
runs in four different frameworks so

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,200
there's some acme ism involved there

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,880
amongst frameworks the one I use the

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,740
most Social development's web simple

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,540
here's a web simple app it's super

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,520
simple it's nice it's just use web

00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,510
simple you've got this dispatch requests

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,580
up in that then you build your you have

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:55,080
a list of subs in that that will handle

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:58,710
your routes you can call that allow the

00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,570
FC directly with pearl and path in this

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,490
case / and it will give you back the

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,500
content and content types so it's nice

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,460
for kind of seeing what you have of

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,440
course you can start it up as a

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:12,510
full-blown PSD I application my black up

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,660
some of the routes the page ID one will

00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:17,250
look at here when you're going when I

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,540
was abstracting this to run under

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,820
different frameworks you realize there's

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,700
this consistent theme consistent pattern

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,800
of you have a route and you basically

00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,480
have a route handler and give it a name

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,660
you're gonna have a request method again

00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,190
post what have you you're going to have

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,840
the request handler in this case is view

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,580
page and you can have some parameters

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,080
you're collecting parameters so is what

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,730
you're doing so collecting parameters

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,740
and you're going to process them so the

00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,390
view page is kind of like my app the

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,270
method that will handle it the response

00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:48,240
handler response type HTML or could be a

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:50,340
redirect or could be JSON and a status

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,170
code so that really defines each one of

00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,780
the snippets that these subs that would

00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,520
be in the website modification of the

00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,020
dance or application which is the talk

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,020
going on now there's one later on that

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:05,420
mojo mojo licious there's talk later on

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,420
that if you're interested at some point

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,460
so here's the view payment view page

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,620
method it doesn't have any dependencies

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:18,120
on the actual framework used which is

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:20,310
all written in in my app so eat your

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,460
params you read from the database the

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,050
page you render it and then I'm doing

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,880
kind of this dirty regex for my

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,430
templates I started out with just hear

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,260
Doc's right everybody tells you not to

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,120
use regex is which is true but that's

00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,000
what i'm using now if I wanted to change

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,180
it probably do HTML zoom or our mojo

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:45,570
stomp ways to get in there and

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:45,570
replace content within specific tag

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:57,089
let's see this is [ __ ] actually who when

00:08:50,529 --> 00:09:00,399
was moves first release to see Pat by no

00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:01,930
six years okay you're the winner of the

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,580
first piece of schwag I've got three

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:09,010
t-shirts here or yeah it's 2006 I think

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,899
just looked it up today or you can have

00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,630
some moose and senses actually moosh

00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:16,680
dumb moose carcass I think it is gone

00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:22,510
and it smells good they willows and

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:24,459
Aspen's and yeah so you know when you're

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:30,490
hanging out with MSD you bring your most

00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:32,380
instance jumped ahead of here tip you

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,540
know using rolls I build a roll and they

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,480
find out all I need this in a script so

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,680
I just turn it into a class which most

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,540
you probably know this technique but

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,850
it's a handy technique just build the

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,680
class and consume the row and then you

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,750
can use it in a script so you don't have

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,410
to use it in another class which is

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:53,430
normally where your rows are this is an

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,870
just kinda side dealing with roles and

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:58,029
modifiers so let's say I've got this

00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,089
role here with the talk method and it's

00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:02,470
got a modifier after and then I've got a

00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:04,959
consumer of the role that also has a

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:11,459
talk method now when I invoke that talk

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:18,279
method what's going to happen anybody

00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:22,000
for a piece of schwag guesses don't have

00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:24,160
to be right so I'm going to call talk in

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,300
the package that consume the role that

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:34,650
also had talked with the method modifier

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:34,650
yeah yeah let's get to it very nice way

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,779
but Logan

00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:46,689
but imagine consumer consumer's going to

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,670
override the talk so you won't get to

00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:51,639
talk from the role but you will get the

00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:55,119
method modifier you will get the after I

00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:57,670
had no idea that's thanks to come

00:10:55,119 --> 00:11:00,670
storing comment informative that one day

00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:03,939
he's doing talk as well messages and

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:06,550
Frank logging frameworks so keep him in

00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:09,399
mind so that's just a tidbit I thought

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,459
was pretty cool now movie has been

00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:14,290
changing a bit moves trying to adapt

00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:16,420
more and more to be able to well allow

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:19,240
you to migrate to using mousse migrate

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,329
to moves are actually just used moves so

00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:26,019
what can you do now today you can extend

00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:28,209
a move class so mojito is a moon base

00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,970
class you can extend that you can use

00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:35,610
mousse to do so you can also consume

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:38,050
move roles within a moose class and

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:42,610
furthermore you can actually in this

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:46,689
case it's my tide uses mu x type smoosh

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:50,439
like the string and that will just work

00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:52,029
it will actually use the mousse or in

00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:55,720
this case the internal the built-in

00:11:52,029 --> 00:12:00,209
string so it will inflate the moose type

00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:07,870
object when you use mousse with a moral

00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:09,339
that's thanks damage t so collections

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,540
one of the features here's our

00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:11,980
collections you're actually seeing a

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,809
collection now this is my presentation

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,429
my presentation is done in mojito we're

00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:16,809
stepping through a sequence of documents

00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:22,509
so you can put together a set of

00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:26,499
documents and sort them and then run

00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:29,949
through them as we are now and you can

00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:31,329
then page through them as we as we do

00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:35,860
and you can merge a collection and you

00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:37,569
can also publish in some sense a

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,089
collection so we'll see that moment

00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:42,429
shortcuts bar for a mojito ours from

00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:44,079
mojo mojo table of contents it's kind of

00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,639
nice to have so you can do these

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,129
shortcuts with these double curly

00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,230
brackets TLC will start with h 2 and

00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:53,079
beyond if i wanted to start h1 i just

00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,999
have a 1 dash and catch them all cpanel

00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:55,560
shortcut so you can get a URL for Sipan

00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:59,580
module

00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,279
or metod Sipan URL and just you can get

00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:04,950
the gist URL ID if you want in bed so

00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:08,250
yes and that last one is actually will

00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,840
pull up the last ten synopsis on Sipan

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,730
which I've been fooling around with its

00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:17,490
bit finicky when you're trying to parse

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:18,570
everybody's synopsis it does publish to

00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,980
mojo mojo if you give it some

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:22,140
configuration you tell what's the base

00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,260
URL and give it the credentials and you

00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,700
have that as an option from my page this

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,620
I wrote a little bit about there's an

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,720
article on rendering mojo mojo if you

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,270
just connect up with the data the mojo

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,820
mojo datastore so you got this dee dee

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:39,300
VIX class let's get your DSN for that

00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:42,120
schema and you can then pass in the page

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,310
name which you see I get from the path

00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,320
it's the last item in the path that's

00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,060
that page name in then i can find that

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,990
document in the mojo modules database

00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:53,670
and then render it was mojito because

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,589
it's going to be marked down our textile

00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,150
which is handled already so i just got

00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:59,370
to figure out which format is it in

00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:06,990
which is stored in the multimodal

00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:08,750
documents so it can do things on its own

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:15,630
so let's see a little bit of a demo then

00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:17,850
that's really i'm here i guess right new

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,860
page here's your new page this game

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,589
files from mojo mojo bit it's a split

00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,600
view I'll you see in a moment but you

00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:26,490
have your choices for textile markdown

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,710
creo I just going in there to see how

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,000
easy it was to add another flavor don't

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:35,010
really use Creole too much although

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,760
seems fine HTML or pot now so I want to

00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,760
do some textile

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,490
good so I have that and then you see a

00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:47,709
render on the right so there's some

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,089
little Ajax Eve stuff going on behind

00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:52,240
the scenes that will grab that content

00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:54,879
after you let up off your keys and after

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,610
whatever seconds and then send it to the

00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,949
back end and get it rendered and display

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,050
it there in the text area now at this

00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:04,540
moment nothing's safe if it crashes I've

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,550
lost my content but if i want to start

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:10,509
getting this automatic save going on

00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:13,569
which is a feature that was lacking of

00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:15,459
mojo mojo so this is when i added so

00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:18,399
let's say at this point is going to

00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:20,620
commit it to the get back end when i

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,389
press create it's going to commit it so

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,000
I can you know have a new tag or

00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:27,970
whatever so this would be my commit

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,730
message at that moment that's done I it

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:34,149
buddy fall I'm leaving you in edit mode

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:36,310
now whenever you're right at that moment

00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:38,050
is the art within a couple seconds it's

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,459
saved so it's autosave so it's kind of

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,810
nice because if you do start writing a

00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:42,100
bed in here and get some big documents

00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,019
and you forget to save the damn thing

00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:49,139
and you walk away and your kid closes

00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:49,139
the browser you know it be there for you

00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,529
and now the other day I sick and

00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,329
sometimes you want that just little

00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:57,880
sticky sticky note you want it small

00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:59,500
right so thought well this break from

00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,029
the split view and let's go to toggle

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,189
view and so knock and just have a little

00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:07,180
bitty text area I can resize it wherever

00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:08,889
I want up on my desktop so it's not in

00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:12,569
the way so the top of you is kind of

00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:15,040
nice in that sense it's usable now

00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:19,350
recently and then I also added ability

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:22,329
to assign this document to a feed this

00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:25,000
the UI is really basically you click on

00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:31,600
that and you get a text input and you

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:33,670
can say iron man whatever it is and it's

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,839
going to be assigned to a feed at that

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,189
moment which is just going to be a

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,750
collection of documents that you can

00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:39,730
access I should be careful to word

00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:43,259
collection list of documents you can

00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:45,819
access and also get an expat impede of

00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:48,370
the collections part actually here i can

00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:50,050
assign it to a collection so I can

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,970
assign it to the only collection have

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,600
right now is going to undocumented I can

00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,600
assign it to that

00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:04,410
okay actually at that point yes going to

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:09,240
the collections a little bit so here

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:11,640
here that is this collection if you want

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,049
to create a new one what it does just

00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,059
list all the documents obviously if you

00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:17,069
got a lot that's going to be maybe exam

00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:20,130
too much information but they're listed

00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:25,890
in order of chronological order so you

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:29,280
can give it a collection name and then

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:33,450
this is from jQuery UI it's kind of nice

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:37,490
you can do the drag so it's a little

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:37,490
faster than having to select a mall work

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:45,450
mouse clicks creates a collection you

00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,250
got a collection now this test one there

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,860
it is they're ordered if I don't like

00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:52,169
the order I can sort it in this from the

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,600
jQuery you are you oh that needs to be

00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:56,669
up there so there's a little shininess

00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:01,020
for you if you want to show anybody and

00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:06,150
it works order that collection at that

00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:08,790
point ok and then let's see we said it

00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,840
merges so if I want to try to publish

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,429
something here and I've got these

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,610
chapters and I want to merge it into

00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:17,220
something complete here then here it is

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,840
with the toc the table of contents the

00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,679
the full document just all merged

00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:25,440
together so that's nice if you are

00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:29,610
writing that much that you want that

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:32,610
structure and it will actually try to do

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,950
a epub I have caliber on the back end as

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,140
an option that will try and publish that

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,000
we will publish any pub but the format

00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,370
on that is still still kind of working

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,320
with that it breaks it at every H so if

00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,360
you got h 1 h 2 h 2 you're going to have

00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,780
three different pages which may or may

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,780
not be useful

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:58,990
let's see anything else that I promised

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:02,380
or any questions we got still Marsh yeah

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:08,620
no one so he's got a winch some schwag

00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:14,530
okay let's see um who just who created

excellent yeah and this would be really

00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:59,110
nice this was Trotz Larry this is girl

00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:04,020
sighs so she says it wasn't supposed to

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:07,870
play faster someone saying anybody I

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:09,490
think I think MST had enough make if I

00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:12,810
was named more grown-up I guess so

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:16,510
Dimitrov so actually incredible creature

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:21,330
here's to the ladies if anybody wants

00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:25,120
one and the other questions this point

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:28,480
yep back will you have the page that you

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:32,620
had the four different input methods and

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,150
the tab order in gather this when you

00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,260
type in one when you switch through all

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:39,820
those others tabs does it automatically

00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,080
get like you type in textile and you

00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,910
switch the mark down what does it

00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,470
convert that or can you switch back and

00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:48,580
forth or house over it's a good question

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:50,920
you have an implicit an implicit format

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,400
to that page and right now it's mark

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,080
down and it's at a creation time so when

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,710
you create the page then you commit to

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:04,830
an implicit format so in this case let's

00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:04,830
say I can go with textile

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:18,039
but I can also put a mark down so it

00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:20,230
doesn't really matter which one you

00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,990
choose is you know people generally have

00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,280
a preference I set my default which is

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,520
configurable in the comp you can set

00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,960
your default to be textile or markdown

00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,970
either one that you can change it at

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,470
creation time yeah that's a good

00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,539
question then that's saved with the dark

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:39,190
document is part of its attributes its

00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:40,990
default wiki format so you click on look

00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:47,740
at you click on HTML right now what

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:49,750
exactly shows up or not work oh well

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,549
well now when we we haven't changed the

00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,880
content yet so it doesn't read ender yet

00:21:51,549 --> 00:22:02,289
but if I had hit it House thinks it's

00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:05,440
just HTML oh so it made a CH one to do

00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:08,080
that well that was the idea was I didn't

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,030
want to take away HTML wanted to give

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,380
you HTML as an option you get these this

00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:15,190
is known i wouldn't put this on a

00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:17,470
public-facing web site with anonymous

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,539
user access at this point right because

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,280
you can do HTML or you can write

00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:24,210
JavaScript and all that it's more for

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,530
personal use and it does you know it has

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,539
digest authentication right now to get

00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,340
into so you can set a matter of run it

00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:32,679
on the web but it requires a user

00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,360
account which brings up a point that

00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:35,679
very bottom here you can make pages

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,270
public so you're right and you've got

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,289
these mostly personal notes but once a

00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,789
while you want to throw something out

00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:41,289
there you can turn a document into

00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:43,720
public and then you just put public in

00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:45,549
the URL and it's available so that's

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,780
kind of nice if you because if you write

00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:48,549
a decent enough document you want to

00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,700
publish it then you can do that readily

00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:50,700
enough

00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,779
this I got two more things to give away

00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:07,609
here somebody's got to take me up on it

00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:16,460
I don't want to go back with well what's

00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:28,519
the MST talking on scary okay if you

00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:33,409
want the matter then and Mia guy what's

00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:35,749
he talking on polygamy language is

00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:42,019
a-comin your polygon all right so you

00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:43,519
gotta grow feathers up anything sure and

00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:46,629
that's it for me I think less there's

00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:46,629
