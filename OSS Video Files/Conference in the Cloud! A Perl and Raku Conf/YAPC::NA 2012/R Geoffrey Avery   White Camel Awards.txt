but yes aha there we go so a few years

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,469
ago I gave up doing the white camel

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,529
wards and I figured great I'm never

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,449
going to have to do this again this is

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,689
not working out quite the way I expected

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,580
brian foy who you may know I was unable

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,260
to be here there he is with his white

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,050
camel award for those of you don't know

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,340
the white camel award is given to

00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,679
members of the pearl community who have

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:36,360
performed services to the pearl

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:39,780
community not as much in a coding way as

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,790
in a social way to promote the community

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,120
to maintain the community and to help

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:48,840
out the community and if you get one of

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,510
these awards you get this shiny lucite

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,399
block which is pointing and hard to

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,629
carry in your luggage so fortunately

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,699
this year we're going to be shipping

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,809
them to the winners and so they would do

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,270
not have to actually carry them home

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,920
that's mine surrounded by Doctor Who

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,239
videos and I actually had to carry that

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,180
home you're lucky you don't have to

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,280
carry this home anyway let me get my

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,200
notes here sorry Brian emailed me it

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,030
like I think midnight last night and

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,500
said would you do this and I was little

00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,570
so if I seem a little frazzled because I

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,380
don't have that much prep time anyway

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:28,220

award that is long overdue and is

00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:36,170
personally satisfying to me jim keenan

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,170
of new york

00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,240
jim has been acquired but effective

00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,040
pearl influence for years he led pearl

00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,250
seminar New York a technical compliment

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,770
to NY p.m. social focus he volunteers to

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,510
help at many hackathons gently advises

00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,010
new events and was instrumental in

00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,490
bringing together separate pearl groups

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,750
within New York City I've known Jim

00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,700
pretty much since he joined the Pearl

00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:07,190
community and came up to me and one day

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,990
said something along the lines of why

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,510
don't we ever have tech tech meetings I

00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,820
said because NY p.m. is a social group

00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,510
and he said can I do tech meetings I

00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:19,130
said you go right ahead and do that and

00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:22,310
and unlike a lot of other people people

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,710
would have he did and for over a decade

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,930
now we have had pearl technical meetings

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,960
on a regular basis and it is partially

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,880
Jim's fault I would like to thank Jim

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,620
personally and congratulate him on

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,620
winning a well-deserved white cap

00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,800
and David it then right at my side from

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,740

meeting in December of two thousand and

00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,990
I couldn't have done it without

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,330
so avoid the hardware hackathon

00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,930

camel award okay it's not worth a lot

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,110
except sentimentally but that's what's

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,700
kind of important about it and it's

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,590

00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,760
