hello good afternoon hope we all had a

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,139
good lunch out there had a good the

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,630
morning where we all insurance keynote

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,760
this morning I hope there's anybody not

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,369
there because I'm going to reference

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,430
that a lot because he touched on a lot

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:29,550
of things that we're going to talk about

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:34,880
here as well sorry my name is Andy

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,899
Lester I've already cleared the room and

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,379
I'm going to be talking about how

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,940
newbies can get started contributing to

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,050
open source who here considers

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:49,680
themselves a new be good how many people

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,960
this is your first conference you being

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:58,530
here is contributing to open source so

00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:00,899
thank you for being here yes how many

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,809
old bees do we have in the room how many

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,140
people have contributed stuff to see pan

00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:09,299
okay this isn't at all for you but that

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,500
but what I want to tell you is that for

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,869
the new people there's so much more to

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,240
open source and the community around it

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,729
that is more than just contributing code

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,460
schwarm tart this morning about how so

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,970
much of pearl is focused on writing code

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:31,590
that goes on the sea pen writing modules

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:34,710
and that's good because the cpn is one

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:38,220
of the jewels of pearl but there's so

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,909
much much more than that and I want you

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,369
all to know I want all the newbies to

00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:48,780
walk out here knowing that they can

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:53,189
contribute somehow and wanting to

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:56,880
contribute somehow so I told my daughter

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:59,729
what I was going to be talking about I

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,939
said give me some art and so this is her

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,950
representation of it ends that I kind of

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,649
explained it it she doesn't understand

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,979
software distribution but that's a

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:14,459
representation be in my apple

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,049
but this kind of this this the thought

00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,560
that balloon down here I'm not very good

00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:21,690
with computers change that too I'm not

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,909
very good with programming and you have

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,330
the problem that so many people have

00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:29,489
they say well you know I there's all

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,250
these amazing tools out there there's

00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:35,450
moose and catalysts and DB IX class and

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,489
dancer and so much that's out there and

00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,290
it can feel daunting like well I'm not a

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,440
rock star programmer I'm not a genius

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:47,099
programmer I can't contribute and that's

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,840
not true at all so the idea of I'm not

00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:52,440
very good with computers and we've

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,510
probably all heard you know our Uncle

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,040
Dave tell us that log not very good with

00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:00,269
computers can you come over and fix my

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:03,480
internet we all have a lot of amazing

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:06,510
skills that we can contribute and I want

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,650
you all to please help contribute to my

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:13,799
open source so my first rule that I want

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:19,049
everyone to remember is that you are

00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:22,400
worthy of contributing a lot of times we

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:25,590
can have kind of a rock star sort of

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,669
mentality where we say oh isn't Larry

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:32,250
amazing or isn't you know isn't Ricardo

00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:36,930
Ricardo cygnus an amazing guy and we

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:39,120
kind of have these luminaries but that's

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,069
just them there are so many other people

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,069
and pearl they contribute to that and

00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:46,650
you are worthy of being those people

00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:50,130
also those people didn't start out as

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:53,069
rock stars Larry did not start out as a

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:56,599
rock star Larry started out just being

00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:58,829
some guy working at JPL and over time

00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,950
the things that he did have been

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:06,739
amazingly important contributions both

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,739
to pearl but in computing in general

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,489
so what's the first question that most

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:17,060
people ask when I talk to them about

00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:23,389
open source about this sort of idea of

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:24,950
contributing anyone is it difficult ooh

00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,860
that's kind of a good one no that's not

00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:29,660
normally what I get and I see this

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:34,430
posted on mailing lists or unread it a

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:37,100
lot in / r / open source yes what should

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:40,370
I work on what is a good project to work

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:45,350
on and the answer to that is anyone want

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:48,490
to suggest the best project to help on

00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:50,780
is one that you actually use right now

00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,419
open source is all about scratching an

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,760
inch and a lot of people feel like that

00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,830
that they should say oh oh I'm going to

00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,570
find a project that needs me but really

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,240
you want to find a project that you need

00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:05,510
and that you can easily contribute to

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,210
then the second best is one that you

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:11,479
want to use something that actually is

00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:14,510
interesting to you so there's there's no

00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:16,479
one way to answer what that answer is

00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,800
because it's different for everybody

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,240
there's a wonderful sight I don't have a

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,789
slide for because I didn't think of it

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:30,669
till just at lunch there's a wonderful

00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:35,419
site called open hatch org and it is uh

00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:37,310
it aims to match up projects with things

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,500
that need to get done and people who are

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,450
interested in them and I've been talking

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,630
to them and I'd really like to help them

00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,919
get going because once you find out a

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,320
project that you're interested in

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,610
they're aiming to they want to help

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:55,070
match up skill sets so go take a look at

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:58,580
them there's a lot of cool stuff that I

00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:01,450
think is going to come out of that open

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:04,450
hatch dot org am I right on that URL

00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,450
okay

00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:12,110
this talk i have another website that

00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:13,789
i'm working on that is going to be

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,759
basically an expanded version of this

00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:19,940
talk that is more general that it's kind

00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:23,030
of gone go along with open hatch I don't

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,919
have that ready for announcement yet and

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,900
it looks like crap so I'm not going to

00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:32,590
tell you what it is eighty nine starts

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:35,030
calm but don't don't hold it against me

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:38,900
so the first thing you do when you find

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,669
a community or project that you want to

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:46,430
that you're interested in contributing

00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:48,620
into is you want to listen and learn you

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,440
want to understand what the community is

00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:54,110
that you're that you're trying to help

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,520
out with because we think about code we

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,840
think about code all the time oh I'll

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,840
just go look in the bug queue and I'll

00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:04,120
go fixing bugs but you have to

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,120
understand how that community works

00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:11,539
there there are all kinds of different

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:14,509
ways to that the community works and you

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:17,599
need to grok that before you go barging

00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:20,389
in saying hey I'm going to do all this

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,270
stuff for you they enthusiasm is good

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:26,029
but it can set you off on the wrong foot

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:29,240
on the one hand you have some you have a

00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:32,659
project like bugs which was the Perl 6

00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,759
implementation Haskell and Audrey said

00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:37,789
anybody want to commit bit just email me

00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:40,330
and commitments want everywhere and

00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:42,500
everybody could commit to the project

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:46,400
everybody know what i mean by commit bit

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:50,599
anybody not know that on the flip side

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,990
you have a project like postgres which

00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:57,110
is extremely regimented which has very

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:59,930
well defined processes about how patches

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,630
are what exactly what patches have to

00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:04,310
look like the review process that goes

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,139
through patches that patches have to go

00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,930
through before they're accepted they're

00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:13,820
very rigorous which when you're dealing

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:17,540
with my database yeah i want that so but

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,850
but a different project like a wiki or

00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,800
a web site of one of mine like Bobby

00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,440
tables calm which is about sequel

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:28,520
injection I have that where anybody can

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,930
just mail me a patch request on github I

00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,610
have the source for the website online

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:35,210
and yeah okay just send it to me at all

00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,700
and I'll publish it so understand how

00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:41,360
the dynamic is what the social dynamic

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,580
is and how things actually happen on the

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:50,030
other things what does the project value

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:55,100
is is it's kind of consider consider

00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:58,520
what the community finds important it

00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,440
does it value speed / accuracy does it

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:07,130
you know do they want to release often

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:10,280
or are they very regimented so how do

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:13,730
you listen and learn well you can join

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:16,160
mailing list read blogs of followers

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,260
join IRC go to user group meetings as

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,870
the biggies that come off the top of my

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:25,880
head the mailing lists many projects

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:28,940
most of all the development will send

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,980
her on a mailing list noreen this

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,290
morning was talking about how in Apache

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,950
projects if it doesn't happen on a

00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,540
mailing list it doesn't exist but

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,880
different projects do things differently

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:47,240
I know that for instance the catalyst

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:51,110
and projects are most of the development

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:54,490
there is done nirc and so different

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:57,410
projects communicate different ways

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,360
reading the blogs of the leaders of the

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,700
project can be very informative and

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,520
gives you a feeling for what you're

00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,830
getting into there'll be a lot of

00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,960
technical information typically but

00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,850
you'll also get a feel for who the

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,330
people are who the players are in the

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,330
project

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,470
so remember and just remember every

00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,420
project does this differently what works

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:26,930
in one place isn't going to work

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:32,180
everywhere so stepping back spending a

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:35,450
day or two or a week just listening will

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,520
help you get into the project and will

00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:42,500
help you find out what is important to

00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:47,959
the project and what they need stealing

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:50,510
from this morning um this a lot of times

00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:53,390
this is from SH worn this morning a lot

00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:57,560
of times it feels like everything is

00:10:53,390 --> 00:11:00,950
about code it feels like because really

00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,480
that's that's like our deliverable Hey

00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:05,510
look I have a tarball I want to

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,070
contribute to that tar ball and so we

00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:11,350
think in terms of code code code code

00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:13,850
code but the code is almost a byproduct

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,890
it is the deliverable but there are so

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,110
many other things that go into feeding

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:21,020
that so the rest of this i'm going to be

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,480
talking about specific things you can do

00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,940
to help out the projects any questions

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,180
so far any questions comments stop me if

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:35,420
you need to somebody asked me something

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:37,940
so i can take a drink no okay

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:42,590
number one thing you can do as somebody

00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:45,110
coming in trying to help out is dealing

00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:47,600
with bugs dealing with bug management

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:53,240
and bug management doesn't necessarily

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:55,700
mean fixing every project has some sort

00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:00,760
of bug tracking system whether it's in

00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:05,630
github or it's in RTE it rtcp org or

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:08,150
whatever bugs are the things are the

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:11,900
tickets are the things that fall by the

00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:14,300
wayside as work gets done because the

00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,550
people who are that kind of that the

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,190
captain kirk's of the project running

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:23,750
forward and adding features leave the

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:26,270
bugs behind and maybe a bug will get

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:29,210
fixed and we won't even know it so how

00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,880
can we help with bug management and when

00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:34,520
I say bug that also includes things like

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,840
feature additions as well the number one

00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,400
thing you can do as far as bug

00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:44,150
management is actually report a bug how

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,740
many of us fess up we see a bug we

00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:49,160
figure out a way to work around it and

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,980
then never tell anyone about it we say

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,260
oh well gee this syntax highlighting you

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:57,590
know oh gee the syntax highlighting for

00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:00,650
such ants for pearl in vim doesn't work

00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:03,020
if I have a percent at the as the first

00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:05,720
line in the column so I'll just indent

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,610
it a space and I'll get around it and I

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,790
move on and I just live with it I live

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:13,910
with the broken window we all know the

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:17,750
theory of broken windows that if you're

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:20,660
in the neighborhood that if you can

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:23,000
leave a parked car for weeks on the

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,340
street and nobody will touch it but if

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,650
you break a window on that car within

00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:32,900
hours the thing is stripped because

00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:35,870
people see one sign of neglect as seeing

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,120
that is worthless and so it's the same

00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:41,040
thing I would say oh oh it's a bug will

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,450
just pass it by

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,460
reporting these bugs is important

00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,770
because one people don't know about it

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,840
it can't get fixed unless you know about

00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:52,450
it and I'm sure we've all yelled at our

00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:56,080
users why didn't you tell me about this

00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,730
well we follow the same rules we have to

00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,680
live by the same rules on the projects

00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:02,680
we work on so if you're going to yell at

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,390
if you're going to go yell at the person

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,250
over on accounting who didn't tell you

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:09,400
that this has been failing for three

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,470
weeks you have the same responsibility

00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:15,990
to report the problem with your tools

00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:22,570
the modules that you're using second

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:26,560
enhance an existing bug report a bug

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:28,180
ticket is not a static document a bug

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,300
ticket is something that is going to

00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,830
evolve over time one of the things that

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,410
I think is so beautiful about the way

00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:39,520
github issue tracker works is that it is

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:45,850
so but simple to add comments and and

00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:50,530
notations and links to the issue on in

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:52,360
the issue tracking system so anything

00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:59,460
you can do to add information to that

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:59,460
ticket is a win so yes

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,180
yeah sure the best would be the best

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,970
thing would be look I've isolated this

00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,920
problem to exactly this exactly this and

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:19,820
here's the test case I wrote that that

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,930
test it but if you can't do that that

00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,600
doesn't mean it's not worth reporting

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:27,440
and we'll talk to that in a little bit

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,030
so for instance you might go look at the

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,670
bug queue and say okay well here's a bug

00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:33,380
Q that is kind of a bug that it's kind

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:37,490
of vague oh well here's a problem that

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:40,520
we have with this piece of code go in

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:43,220
and try it yourself oh gee okay well

00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:47,350
you've reported on Linux i'm going to go

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:50,390
test it on Mac os10 here is what I found

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,610
all of these are little bits of

00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,380
information that add to the greater

00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,740
whole of knowledge about how to fix that

00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,930
bug we've all had that prompt we've all

00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:03,800
had those cases where we've been fixing

00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:06,320
a bug and all of a sudden you turn over

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:11,510
one little rock and you go AHA that's

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:13,970
the problem well maybe in this case the

00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:16,610
fact that it at it fails as a different

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:19,780
mayor message on OS 10 will be the rock

00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,580
that you've overturned for somebody else

00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,410
all of these little things that we

00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:28,100
contribute are what i like to call

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:31,190
stitches like if you're if you're

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,890
putting together a quilt or a large but

00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:36,860
let's just say a quilt everybody can add

00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,060
a stitch to the quilt and it adds to the

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,730
greater whole you don't have to

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:45,440
understand the whole quilt but just that

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:48,560
one little stitch that you make adds to

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,360
the strength of everything and we when

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,980
you sit here and you're doing that if

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,720
you were actually stitching on a quilt

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,490
you wouldn't say well this these

00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,780
stitches don't count these aren't

00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,500
important out so i'm not going to do

00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:02,420
them all these little things add up the

00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,420
barrier i want i want everybody to

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:08,079
realize that the barrier to entry to

00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:12,220
helping out on projects is very very low

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,220
if you see it the right way

00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,439
okay another thing you can do is try to

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,660
isolate a bug which is like what you

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,670
were saying I was not able to have this

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:25,500
happen under firefox but it does under

00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:27,929
firefox 9 and so far a 2.4 maybe you

00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,510
have ideas submit that idea as well add

00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:34,290
this to the add this to the existing

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:38,940
ticket how long do I have I just real

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:47,460
like till 10 after okay I'll just do all

00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:52,890
afternoon sorry oh ok ok so again we can

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:55,320
talk about isolating the bugs one of the

00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,960
things that kind of that can be put off

00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,970
put-put offing that can put off the

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:04,650
authors are the people who are working

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:06,120
on the project is if you come in and if

00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,100
you're going to provide information

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:12,059
provide information that you know is

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:14,790
true but don't say things like oh this

00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:16,770
happens in all cases and this applies to

00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,990
bug reporting in general don't say oh

00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:21,390
well this hat this fails on everything

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,040
I've tried or this fails on every

00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,500
template that the project ships with

00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,890
well did you actually try every template

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:34,440
or did you abstract out that these four

00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:36,510
that you tried apply to all 100 a lot of

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,730
this is just good bug reporting in

00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:42,840
general but it's especially important

00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:44,669
when you're dealing with a remote bug

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,740
tracking system somebody who may on the

00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:48,809
other side of the world not be able to

00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,809
just walk over to your cube and say tell

00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:54,900
me more about this so the importance of

00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:58,080
good documentation for your code and for

00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,419
what you've done is amplified even more

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,690
when you're dealing with bug tracks bug

00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,690
tracking

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:17,200
if you can write a test that's huge we

00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:19,330
all of our perl modules we've all well

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,130
and i hope we've all installed perl

00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:24,250
modules and when you install the module

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:27,429
it runs an entire test suite to make

00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:31,929
sure that we're so can your system there

00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:34,600
aren't always enough tests in the module

00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:37,270
distribution and it's I can't think of

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,870
any project that wouldn't welcome more

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:45,880
tests to validate that thing's install

00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:48,929
correctly so the the power and we have

00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:52,000
such a good testing culture in Perl

00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:55,240
we've pretty much driven a lot of

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,600
test-driven development in the rest of

00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,640
the industry and people look at us and

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,789
go wow that's really great compare that

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:08,429
with PHP where they ship PHP

00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:08,429
distributions with known failing tests

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,260
you know they had a security bug that

00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:17,890
went out a couple months ago that a test

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:20,080
caught and they didn't care because it

00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,940
had been crying wolf for months and

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,450
months and months so they never noticed

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:30,070
the failing test the power of tests to

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:32,110
actually uncover bugs is huge and we at

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,419
we and pearl are really good at it so if

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:38,850
you can add another test to the test

00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:38,850
suite that's a big win yes

00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:45,150
who taught that okay good good

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,890
develop cover yes

00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,460
right

00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,380
right for the backup for the back of the

00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,690
room he's talking about devel colon

00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:12,230
colon cover which is a code coverage

00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:15,470
tool and what that does is it for those

00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:18,320
who haven't seen it it devel cover runs

00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:21,380
the test suite that for the module and

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,440
then it gives you a beautiful HTML map

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:27,610
of all the lines of code and all the

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:31,640
lines of code that have been tested in

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:33,260
the test suite and if you don't have

00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,270
something tested by the test suite you

00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,340
say oh well to you probably you know

00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:40,880
this function is never exercised by the

00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:43,400
test suite so it might fail and we would

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,930
never know it and so devel cover is a

00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,190
great way to do that yes definitely um

00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:52,010
for those of you who are working on

00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:54,800
projects that aren't that aren't just

00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:57,470
purl that are you know on things that

00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,510
are in see for instance compiler

00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:03,370
warnings every time you have a compiler

00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:08,840
warning the compiler is crying wolf and

00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:11,060
we don't want to emulate the the PHP

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,030
mentality of all it's just out it's just

00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:18,440
noise we don't care ideally everything

00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:20,690
passes and doesn't ship until everything

00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,810
is all clean and compiler warnings work

00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:26,660
against that so if you can if you see a

00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:28,970
compiler warning or or even worse in

00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:32,900
Perl an actual warning from use warnings

00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:35,450
or strict then go and figure out why

00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,130
that is silence that warning make sure

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:41,360
that it's not actually warning you about

00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:47,090
something important and quiet that wolf

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:49,600
cry right there yet oh this is a stretch

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,600
okay

00:22:50,150 --> 00:23:00,870
close the ticket as tickets get left

00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:03,510
behind they don't get closed so some so

00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:05,520
there may be say three duplicate copies

00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,950
of the same bug in the bug tracker and

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,550
one of them gets closed when the thing

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:14,010
gets closed but the rest get left behind

00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:17,270
going through and verifying that tickets

00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:21,060
are actually still relevant are still am

00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:24,420
sailing is a great way that you can help

00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:26,760
silence some of that noise and diminish

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:32,360
the load of a bug tracking on the

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:37,530
project team ok enough of tickets um

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:39,270
let's talk about documentation who here

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:42,900
has seen a project that doesn't need

00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:48,140
better documentation not so many hands

00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:52,080
go up what I don't know what NPM is but

00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:53,910
ok anyway every document to every

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,230
project can probably use better

00:23:53,910 --> 00:24:03,600
documentation or more documentation

00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:06,420
pearl especially we want so badly to

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,710
download something and try this module

00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:12,600
and see if it works and so many times

00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:14,820
modules are out there that don't let us

00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,370
do that that don't give us simple ways

00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:21,810
to test things out that don't give

00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:24,060
meaningful examples so if you can if

00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:27,210
you've actually gone through the trouble

00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:30,570
of working with a module that hasn't

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:36,060
given you the the easy examples the easy

00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:37,890
on-ramp to using it take your pain take

00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,870
your a couple of hours of pain and

00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:44,940
figuring out how the parameters actually

00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:49,170
work and turn that into an example that

00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:51,510
you can feed back to the project another

00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:54,900
way that a lot of projects stink at

00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:57,990
documentation for tutorials or you know

00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:00,400
get started in five minutes is that they

00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:03,190
use kind of abstract examples

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,250
and they don't use real examples I would

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:09,190
far rather have a module that explains

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:13,290
that gives real examples of you know

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:17,680
user and salary or whatever rather than

00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:22,000
field1 field2 field three the and the

00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:26,530
more concrete the example the better if

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:29,590
you can document the process a couple of

00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:34,180
years ago pearl five had a real problem

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:38,050
with nobody with the release process of

00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:42,220
a pearl 5 release being black magic and

00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:47,140
voodoo and finally they sat down there

00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:48,460
about 30 of these poor people on p5b who

00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:51,550
sat down and said look we just need to

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:55,180
document this so that it's not bus

00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:58,060
sensitive knowledge so that if if Jesse

00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:00,960
Vincent or Ricardo gets hit by a bus we

00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:05,890
still know how to actually release Pearl

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:10,380
that kind of of knowledge never heard

00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,380
bus sensitive before or truck sensitive

00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:20,710
so yeah oreo there sometimes you'll hear

00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:23,770
people talk about the truck number right

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:26,680
I have a truck number of of two months

00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:28,450
because if I died if I got hit by a

00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:32,010
truck it would take two months to figure

00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:35,410
out what it is that I do for the company

00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:38,200
anyway there shouldn't be any bus

00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:40,990
sensitive knowledge out there and maybe

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,960
what you do is help document what it is

00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:45,370
that's going on around you it's another

00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:50,000
one of those things where it's listening

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:54,220
to what people have to say yes

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,220
tribal knowledge that I heard last right

00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:00,920
right that bus sensitive knowledge is

00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:04,850
tribal knowledge and people understand

00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:07,280
it as a group but as people leave that's

00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:09,230
lost and transferring that information

00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,140
to new people who come in is very

00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:18,290
expensive and inefficient and it sucks

00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:20,060
and nobody likes to do it right some

00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:27,290
things you can do that have absolutely

00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:28,850
nothing to do with programming at all so

00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,620
many websites are out there so many

00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:34,610
project websites are out there that have

00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:37,190
old dead out of data information on them

00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,800
or you'll see a website where they'll

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:41,180
say oh ok well this project is

00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:45,100
somebody's giving a talk about this

00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:48,650
project at some conference in 2006 and

00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,780
it's just old clunky crap that nobody

00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:53,480
wants to read and the real stuff that

00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:56,240
they want to read isn't there you're a

00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,000
user as a user of the project of the

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,550
website you know what you want to see

00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,710
and if you've cursed at the website for

00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,630
the project chances are somebody else

00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:08,140
has as well and that's a great way you

00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,140
can do that

00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:18,830
okay next question how many people here

00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:23,960
are not how many people are here from

00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:26,720
the United States how many of you

00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:30,710
realize that there are people who speak

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,049
languages other than English because i

00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,929
don't think many of us do and one of the

00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:40,159
best ways you can help is to translate

00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:42,200
something because so many projects have

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:46,869
documentation that are only in English

00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:49,190
and Liz can I get an amen on this on

00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:51,919
projects that don't that only deal in

00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:59,419
English how do you how do you deal with

00:28:51,919 --> 00:29:01,519
that well you yours is yes yours is but

00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:06,139
everybody else in da de el doesn't have

00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:12,230
that luxury do they do that okay well

00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:15,110
forget it I'm didn't talk to you okay so

00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:19,279
you know is that can I get an amen on

00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:22,129
the German stuff okay all right well we

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,490
Americans have taken over the world what

00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:24,490
I wanted

00:29:30,620 --> 00:30:00,720
okay oops hold on yes okay okay so here

00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,870
so so here I've got this website called

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,470
Bobby tables com we all know this XKCD

00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:08,790
cartoon I hope about sequel injection so

00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:11,150
I started this website called Bobby

00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:16,530
tables com which tells you how to

00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:17,940
properly avoid sequel injection right so

00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:19,980
here's how you do it in Perl here's how

00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,720
you do it in Delphi etc and then

00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,480
somebody came along and said that's

00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:29,700
really awesome I would like to do that

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:34,350
in German took all the same stuff took

00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:37,710
all my content translated it so now

00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:40,230
everybody who is in and and thank God

00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:43,020
wrote the translation infrastructure

00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:45,360
because I don't know squat about the

00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,730
locale colon colon whatever namespace

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,600
and those kinds of translation things

00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:54,540
make cry and as an ugly American I don't

00:30:51,600 --> 00:31:00,330
know anything other than solo un poquito

00:30:54,540 --> 00:31:04,650
de espanol so um went and translated all

00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:06,330
this stuff to German then this Andre guy

00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:10,679
came along and said oh I'd like to do

00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:13,440
that for Russian okay so he came along

00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:15,830
and here's all the Russian translation

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,470
as well you want to know how to do

00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:23,820
proper sequel binds well some of its not

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:27,230
quite done but he went did all this

00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:31,020
translation he didn't have to write it

00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:33,360
he just had to translate it and that

00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:36,570
kind of that kind of way of taking

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,670
existing knowledge and putting it into

00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,980
something that's more accessible can be

00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,900
a huge win

00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:45,140
and there isn't nearly enough of that

00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:47,780
going on out in open source so if you

00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:50,059
are multilingual at if you are fluently

00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:53,090
multilingual and you can do this kind of

00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:56,419
stuff that's a great win I'd love to see

00:31:53,090 --> 00:32:00,130
more people do that it's anybody done

00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:00,130
any kind of translation stuff like this

00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:19,669
okay where's my cursor there we go okay

00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:23,150
and some of the things we can do are

00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:30,320
just community are just talking about

00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:34,190
things um okay how many people knew who

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,080
I was before I walked in here okay I am

00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:38,480
NOT a rock star programmer I'm not a

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,669
great programmer of a good programmer

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,799
and I've written stuff but the thing

00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:45,049
that I've done that makes it so that you

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:49,100
know about the stuff that I wrote is I

00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:51,919
talked about it and as programmers we

00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:55,100
kind of have this reflexive talking

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,110
about things you work on is bad kind of

00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,840
mentality and I've never understood it

00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:03,290
but people see it as you're bragging or

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,630
your self promoting or you know you're

00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:07,250
trying to get hits on your blog like who

00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:10,850
really gives a damn if you get hits on

00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:14,809
your blog especially in Illinois where

00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:19,929
Amazon they're the Amazon kickback

00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:19,929
program is no longer legal but people

00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:25,490
that affiliate program that's what i was

00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,590
thinking of anyway we sit here and we

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,000
try it it's like we're afraid of talking

00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:34,760
about the things that we've worked on

00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:37,309
and I think that's crap so I want people

00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:40,940
to talk more I want people to tweet more

00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:43,549
I want people to blog more if you see

00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:46,850
something we're all on Twitter right

00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:49,370
most of us on Twitter do at least follow

00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:51,860
twitter feeds okay show of hands who is

00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:53,759
on Twitter maybe I'm overstating the

00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:58,750
reach of two

00:33:53,759 --> 00:34:01,139
okay well whether you tweet it or

00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:04,240
whether you write a blog post about it

00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:07,690
writing this stuff to let people know

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,000
about it is important talking about how

00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,889
things were are talking about the cool

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,899
things you've seen talking about the

00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:17,619
communities that you're part of is part

00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:20,020
of expanding that community if all we do

00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:24,190
is just talk amongst ourselves we don't

00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:26,740
bring anybody else in the only way you

00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:29,139
find out about you know how when you

00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:31,240
find out about a cool new module is it

00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:33,069
because you went and searched Sipan for

00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:37,810
it or it's because somebody told you

00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:39,819
about it that see that and that

00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:41,919
mechanism of talking to people and

00:34:39,819 --> 00:34:44,500
telling about it is an important part of

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:47,980
what we do and if that's your own

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,780
project that's okay I just promoted

00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,220
Bobby tables calm how many of you had

00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,970
heard of that before how many of you

00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:57,760
hadn't and said oh that's kind of cool

00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:59,740
because nobody told you about it and

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,200
that's what we have to do there's

00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,730
nothing wrong i'm not a jerk about it

00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,619
i'm not making money about it just say

00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:10,390
here's a cool thing that you might find

00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:15,010
useful so writing blog posts is huge

00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:16,480
because it tells people about what the

00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:21,010
project actually is if you write

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:23,140
something about how i use this to i use

00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:25,450
dub dub dub mechanized to go and

00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:28,510
automate fetching information from my

00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:31,750
bank and dumping it into an RSS feed for

00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:33,460
myself that gives a way for people to

00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,650
understand how to use the given project

00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:38,770
it's kind of like writing that that

00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:40,329
example tutorial that isn't in the

00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,819
documentation except you've put it out

00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:45,339
on the web you write about what worked

00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:49,020
what didn't work hey here's a problem

00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:51,970
that i ran into using this module and

00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:58,530
after i debugged it I went and I say and

00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:58,530
I um here's how I worked around it

00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:04,900
documenting that is crucial because

00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,900
otherwise we have this

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:18,520
I think we've all been there googling

00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:22,450
for some error message and it's on some

00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:25,000
it's on some online forum and you never

00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:27,010
get the answer and you're like oh dear

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,690
God please maybe I can nail this guy

00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:30,570
that comes back with the bounce and you

00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:33,550
go oh no I'm never gonna see him again

00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:35,230
the only reason that googling for stuff

00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:38,320
on the internet to find the answers is

00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:41,320
because people put it out there it is

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:45,940
your job to put that stuff out there for

00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:49,810
the good of everybody there's also a

00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:53,620
huge benefit in writing a blog post

00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:58,630
writing a blog regularly that is very

00:36:53,620 --> 00:37:01,840
selfish and that is when you go for a

00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:04,270
job interview for your next job that

00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:07,450
blog is proof that you know what you're

00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:09,430
talking about one of the things as it

00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:11,440
part of my other life is I wrote a book

00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:14,470
about job hunting and one of the things

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,930
I suggest is that you bring it at

00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:19,870
portfolio of your work because if I have

00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:20,950
candida and candidate B and they both

00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,110
look good on paper and they both

00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:26,400
interview the same but i can see

00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:29,860
candidate B's code that they've written

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,110
candidate b is the safer choice because

00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,090
candidate B has something that i can

00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:37,380
look at and say okay this person

00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:37,380
actually knows what she's talking about

00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:45,000
short of hand and writing a blog post if

00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:48,460
you can sit here and write a blog post

00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,700
every two weeks at the end of the year

00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,530
you have 25 posts on technical

00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,350
information you've written 25 things

00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:58,270
that talk about what it is that you know

00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:01,930
how to do what your day to day job is

00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:07,120
like and when the time comes that you

00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:10,300
actually have to go and go to your next

00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,190
job interview that that's something that

00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,380
people can look at and get a sense of

00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:16,690
actually who you are and that you're not

00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:19,120
just making up the things that you're

00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:20,349
talking about because as a job as a

00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,119
hiring manager

00:38:20,349 --> 00:38:26,650
anybody can come in and go oh yeah I

00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:28,239
know pearl yeah I use pearl five dot 16

00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,319
which he knows because he went to

00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:36,700
paroled out or see what the latest

00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:41,259
version is right yes in all caps so

00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:49,239
anything you can do to help verify that

00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:52,839
is a win for you okay go to a user group

00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:55,749
meeting or come to come to a Yap see hey

00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:59,799
here you are just being here and talking

00:38:55,749 --> 00:39:03,609
to other people is a win if I wasn't if

00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:05,739
I had any if I lacked any sense of shame

00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:07,509
about corniness I would have you all

00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:09,640
shake hands with the person next to each

00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:18,160
other like we're in church or something

00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:25,469
but say what I'm not I'm not that crazy

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:28,569
so but talking to all these people

00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:30,819
they're talking to just the hallway

00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:32,380
track talking to other people in the

00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:35,460
community talking to the person who you

00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:38,319
happen to be sitting next to in a talk

00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:41,019
that's part of growing the community

00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:43,869
it's a very small it's a stitch it's a

00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:48,190
small stitch but it still adds to

00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:51,729
everything um teste a beta or a release

00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:53,589
candidate this is huge when and and if

00:39:51,729 --> 00:39:55,569
you see Riccardo Cygnus in the hall is

00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:59,229
Ricardo is still the pumpkin right now

00:39:55,569 --> 00:40:01,960
or Jesse Vincent or anybody you they

00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:04,299
will attest to the importance of you

00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,869
downloading and testing a beta version

00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:10,299
of Perl but that applies to any software

00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:11,710
if somebody says if you're on a mailing

00:40:10,299 --> 00:40:13,719
one of these mailing list and they say

00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:17,109
hey look we put out a beta version will

00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:20,229
you please try it out spend the half

00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:22,420
hour hour putting that through its paces

00:40:20,229 --> 00:40:24,700
say hey look there's all my code still

00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:27,969
work if I'm using this new version of

00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:32,380
Perl and then give that feedback because

00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:34,160
it's so much more it it's so much better

00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,830
to find those things out

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,510
a for the release then after and that's

00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:45,380
why they put release candidates out

00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:47,540
there answer a question your honor

00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,420
mailing list your user group answer some

00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:52,730
of these questions try to help them out

00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:54,320
that people don't and don't leave it to

00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:58,690
somebody else don't say Oh somebody else

00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,690
will answer that well maybe nobody will

00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:04,880
draw a logo and and this is kind of a

00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:08,420
stand-in for everything for everything

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,940
else thats related to graphic design I

00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:15,680
can't write I can't do any graphic

00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:18,590
design at all okay my all my web pages

00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,980
that I draw from scratch are in Times

00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:25,370
Roman black and white and if I had use

00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:28,220
h1 tags I'm happy that's not where my

00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:32,510
strengths lie so I rely on other people

00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:34,250
to do my web design for me on my project

00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:38,060
so if you go to better than grep com

00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:39,830
which is a project website of mine it

00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,240
looks all beautiful and pretty and I

00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,940
didn't do a thing with it because I

00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:50,990
don't I can't do any of that pretty

00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:52,940
pretty welcome a newcomer all of you

00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:54,170
welcome to all of you but if you see

00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,920
somebody who hasn't been here before

00:41:54,170 --> 00:42:01,610
whether if here is a user group if here

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:05,960
is an IRC channel or a mailing list your

00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:09,290
local perl mongers mailing list somebody

00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:11,690
says oh hey i just signed up say hi what

00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:14,990
do you do how are you using perl how are

00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:16,970
you using this letting them know that

00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,710
they're welcome one of the things firm

00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:22,130
said this morning that i love is that we

00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:23,570
need to optimize I don't have the quote

00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:27,560
right but we need to optimize our

00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:31,010
communities for the people that want to

00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:32,600
use perl right now our communities are

00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:35,630
optimized for the people who already do

00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:39,230
but if we want people to join we need to

00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:43,280
think in terms of what outsiders want

00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:44,930
coming in if you can talk it a user

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,480
group that's even better that's

00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,960
fantastic there is no use of group

00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,580
anyone

00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,609
the world that doesn't every month have

00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:54,109
to say please somebody give a talk your

00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:55,640
talk doesn't have to be amazing you

00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:58,369
don't have to be a rock star you don't

00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:02,180
have to be Damian Conway and come here

00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:05,510
and do 45 minutes of insane brilliance

00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:07,670
you could do 10 minutes of hey here's

00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:11,570
some stuff that I wrote using dbi X

00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:13,640
class and some problems I had anybody

00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:17,690
here doing a lightning talk here at Yap

00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:19,430
see that is never done one before are

00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:21,800
they still open its Jeff is still taking

00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:24,170
stuff lightning talks are fantastic

00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,089
waited to get your foot to actually say

00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:29,030
something a lightning talk is five

00:43:26,089 --> 00:43:32,570
minutes on some topic you don't even

00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:34,540
need slides so you know maybe you sit

00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:38,420
here and you say you do five minutes on

00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:41,420
comparing TBI X class with some other

00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,550
ORM and here's what I liked about this

00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,619
and that and that's it and you do your

00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:47,300
five minutes and you're done but that's

00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:49,790
huge because if we don't have people

00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:56,720
standing up here doing this you don't

00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:59,660
know it finally do what needs to get

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,390
done and this is kind of a catch-all

00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:05,180
this is part of listening on the parent

00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:09,160
project parents the vm that that Perl 6

00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:13,310
is being built on we had a problem where

00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:17,359
they're using the track database and it

00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:19,400
had years of tickets in track and parrot

00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:22,310
had moved all the source code repository

00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,349
over to github and want to use the

00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:26,089
github issues and there's an argument on

00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:29,540
the mailing list back and forth about

00:44:26,089 --> 00:44:32,030
well you know we should still use track

00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:34,220
for the issue tracking no github is the

00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:36,230
way to do it no track and because

00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:38,599
there's an automated way to move those

00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:40,310
things over if we use github for our

00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:41,810
issue tracking which would be better

00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,310
we're going to throw away all that

00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:44,720
history and there's this back and forth

00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:48,859
and couple of days and kind of got

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,630
heated and I kind of was just vaguely

00:44:48,859 --> 00:44:54,080
aware of this on the mailing list and I

00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:57,800
said what if I did the conversion of the

00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:59,900
tickets I know a language that does text

00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:04,440
manipulation

00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:06,720
what if I did it and so here's a module

00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,760
I look on the sea pan and hey there's a

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,940
module that reads tickets out of track

00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:15,630
and then there's the get API where you

00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:18,630
can post things into github so I wrote

00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,550
some code that read here did the

00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:25,620
massaging and dumped it over into github

00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:28,520
I can't tell you how how happy people

00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:33,150
were that somebody actually did that

00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:38,130
that somebody took the time to do what

00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:41,220
is really scut work right but it's what

00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:44,160
needed to be done now i'm not i'm not a

00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:47,010
big brain on things like parrot and

00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,070
virtual machines and dealing with with

00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:51,330
garbage collection methodologies I don't

00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:54,630
know any of that crap but you know what

00:45:51,330 --> 00:46:00,060
I can massage data were you good and I

00:45:54,630 --> 00:46:01,560
did and that was huge and if I hadn't

00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:05,100
been listening to it if I hadn't been

00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:06,690
listening to the mailing list I wouldn't

00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,250
have said hey here's something they'd be

00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:10,940
done because nobody even considered that

00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:14,670
somebody would want to do that work

00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:19,290
but I did it and that might include

00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:21,030
things like you know that that could

00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:24,630
mean cleaning up after a user group

00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:27,120
meeting that could mean uh you know oh

00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:29,490
look here that we need to convert spaces

00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,100
two tabs and we indent all of this code

00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:34,080
to match our new code styles well nobody

00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,700
wants to be that but maybe you want

00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,020
maybe that's something you can do and

00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:41,490
that can get your foot in the door and

00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:45,030
that can help you out so just do it just

00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:50,190
do what needs to get done and listen for

00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:53,670
those opportunities finally thank

00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:56,270
somebody you are here with all these

00:46:53,670 --> 00:47:00,830
people around you who are all awesome

00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:04,350
all of you for coming here are awesome

00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:06,630
some of us have contributed software

00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:10,740
that you use every day that your jobs

00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:11,730
depend on some of you just came and

00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,830
talked or

00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:16,290
or you know you chatted over something

00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:18,510
at lunch all of these things are all the

00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:20,760
stitches that I'm talking about we need

00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:22,590
to be grateful for that we need to tell

00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,090
people that were grateful for these

00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:28,830
things especially and as somebody who

00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:30,930
works on projects and here's a lot of

00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:33,930
crap most of the time getting an email

00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:38,090
out of the blue that says hey I use ack

00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:41,869
I really like it it makes my life easier

00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:44,040
that's huge that's payment for me

00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:47,780
because nobody else is paying me I'm not

00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:50,850
getting dollars for the things that I do

00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:52,500
spending two minutes to sit here crank

00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:57,450
out an email to the author of somebody

00:47:52,500 --> 00:48:00,540
that was useful is very meaningful to

00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:04,290
them and so please just think in terms

00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:06,690

documentation identifying the problems

00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:09,450
in documentation or API are

00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:11,940
