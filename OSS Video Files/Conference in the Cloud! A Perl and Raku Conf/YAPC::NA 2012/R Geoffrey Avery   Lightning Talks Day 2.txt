started

00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:35,329
sensing thinking thinking it just worked

00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:38,649
a minute ago yeah i won minimize Shh oh

00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:42,829
there we go there we are down there

00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:44,480
there we go yes thank you I'm Ruth babba

00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:46,010
said I work for by water solutions which

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,719
is the library automation company I've

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,449
been programming pearl about 10 years

00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:53,989
yesterday's keynote brought a whole lot

00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:55,609
of stuff out for me and it's not all bad

00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:56,749
news and that's a good thing so I want

00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,370
to tell you a little bit about the

00:00:56,749 --> 00:01:01,219
community that I'm in and how we've done

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,989
things it's a little different the

00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:04,550
community is koha library automation the

00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:06,110
library industry is seventy-five percent

00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,110
women so we ought to have more than

00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,240
three to six percent wouldn't you think

00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,549
we think so too there's 183 committers

00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,820
that's fifteen percent the 15 women

00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:18,050
that's eight percent did a little bit

00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,690
which is better than three to six but

00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:22,250
not good enough including one kind of

00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:28,680
unusual person who committed us both

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:31,620
male and female ohashi

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,810
a little over two years ago when we

00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,910
started the 3.4 release we changed the

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,530
community code governance mechanism the

00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,180
reason for this had nothing whatever to

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,910
do with diversity it had to do with

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,979
getting stable release cycles fewer bugs

00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,660
and more consistent timing of releases

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,900
so we went to a six-month release cycle

00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:51,450
rather than a feature time group release

00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,729
cycle and we reelect the community every

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,380
period the community governance is

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,970
happening on the IRC we have meetings

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,130
monthly there was one yesterday they're

00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,960
widely advertised if you want to vote

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,600
and you're a user or interested in being

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,000
a library user of koha show up and you

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,500
have a vote if you have something that

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,880
the community needs to talk about put it

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,500
on the wiki before the meeting starts

00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,520
and it's in that's all you got to do

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,530
there's no King to bow before to do that

00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,270
the community the governance group

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,610
meaning the people who show up for the

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:25,470
meetings Alexa code management team from

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:26,760
scratch every release for every six

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,450
months cycle and we've got a whole bunch

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,040
of jobs to do okay the code process is

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,470
that you create a patch post it to the

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,530
bugzilla someone who works for somebody

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,660
else needs to sign it off the QAM of the

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,160
assistant QAM sign it off their idea is

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,380
to make sure it doesn't break something

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,239
else and then the release manager pushes

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,670
it to master and previous release

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,120
maintain errs push it to prior versions

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,610
if that makes sense now that's helped a

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,900
whole lot with the bug problem yeah as

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,040
it was designed to and as you would

00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,200
expect a very nice serendipitous side

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,269
effect is that we've got a lot more

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,690
committers because it eased up the

00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:09,180
process of getting a commit and more of

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,730
those are women then we would have

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,860
expected here's the result when 3.4 was

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,200
started immediately after 3.2 was

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,989
released we had 101 committers we have

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,910
183 now seven of the new ones or eight

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:24,299
and a half percent are women so that

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:26,549
ratio is coming up slowly we know

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:28,290
there's a lot more to do this process is

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:32,310
not nearly as streamlined and well

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,720
defined as the apache process but the

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,630
community talked about the apache

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,910
process and said too complicated more

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,660
than we need we're a tiny small group

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,910
anyway but we're making it bigger

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:48,800
process that works but just of this is

00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:52,940
there's more than one way to Picard can

00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,800
I do that Larry thank you yeah there's

00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,760
more than one way to Picard this is the

00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:02,150
way that the community has is trying it

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,950
is starting to work so if you want to

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,900
talk more about it catch me at game

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:19,880
night or tomorrow thank you very much

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:21,920
for your time I'm done next hey tonight

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,840
we're going to do a group ride bicycle

00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,420
ride if you guys want to you can rent

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,820
bicycles at any b-cycle location around

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,590
Madison google that ten bucks also the

00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,480
red spray painted bicycles around town

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,580
if you see one you can grab one and use

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,750
it for free and just put it back we're

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,790
going to meet in the lobby up here

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,920
around 6 45 right out around seven about

00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,990
eight miles in an hour take it nice and

00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,470
easy early so if you want to join us

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,470
coming up

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,550
my name is Mark Allen I want to talk to

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,770
you about what pearl should steal from

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,330
Erlang so at my day job I'm writing a

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,450
lot of Erlang Erlang as a functional

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:19,660
language that has only one type of Luke

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,730
loop construct recursion and because of

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,880
that I had to really change my

00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,830
programmatic paradigm and so what I

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,580
wanted to do was was talk a little bit

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,100
about what I've learned about

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,750
programming from writing Erlang and what

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,090
I think that pearl should steal from

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,500
Erlang in the grand pearl tradition but

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,600
before I get started on that I want to

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,820
tell you what pearl should not steal on

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,050
the on the right on the right side of

00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,330
this slide you'll see that there is a

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,500
list of integers and on the left side of

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,540
this slide you'll see that there is

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,550
actually a string a proper string that

00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,140
has quote smart around it but you will

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,280
see that they evaluate as equivalent

00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:59,440
that is a fail that is not cool no one

00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:01,180
should steal that from early ok here's

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,080
another crazier line thing that I don't

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,400
know it's it's Swedish what can I say so

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,890
what I'm to defining here is a topple

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,200
called a and it has two members one's

00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,060
called ok and the others called foo ok

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,160
so i define that and then I have an if

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,860
statement now you'll see that I say if a

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,790
matches an empty list I return undefined

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:26,050
otherwise if it's true I return WTF and

00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:29,320
look it returns WTF that is a fail no

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,640
one should steal that from our leg but

00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,440
there's still a lot of goodness for

00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,330
example Erlang has a construct called

00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,240
spawn what spawn does is it built a new

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,820
process so are you thinking spawn no

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,870
fail we're not talking about spawn what

00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,430
we're talking about is making a new

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,520
process locally or on a remote system

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,680
honey badger don't care it's really cool

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,270
you will like it there are lots of

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,060
awesome patterns to view what process in

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:54,010
Erlang there's pools and there's there's

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,390
list there's round robins there's all

00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,970
sorts of stuff you just get for free

00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:00,160
it's really really nice um there's more

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,050
goodness there's supervisors are you

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,480
thinking about bill lumbergh I'm not

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,420
that's a fail we're not going to steal

00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,580
bill lumbergh what what supervisors do

00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,140
is they monitor processes including

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,780
other supervisors and so you can build

00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,370
entire process trees and if child

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,860
processes died including other

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,550
supervisors the supervisor above it

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,860
restart

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,480
it's children or not you can set it up

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,740
it has strategies for dealing with

00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,330
failure and how many times it can

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,460
restart and timeouts and all sorts of

00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:32,470
great things but guess what we already

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:34,330
stole it so that guy that guy right

00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,700
there actually implemented this thing

00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:42,610
called PO component supervisor that is

00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:47,140
winning check out it's really cool all

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:53,470
right so early well I don't know your

00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:55,450
names on it so I'm blaming you so um

00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,820
idiomatic Erlang is not offensively

00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,530
coded and actually this is pretty cool

00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,330
so in idiomatic Erlang when you have a

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,070
crash it actually crashes the entire

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,840
process now hopefully that happens with

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,120
a stack trace so you so that you can

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,950
debug it and when that happens the

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,480
supervisor already talked about restarts

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,730
the process and you can abuse it even

00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,190
more it's very cool we like that but

00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:18,660
guess what we already stole this to look

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,660
at this that guy

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:25,830
that guy wrote this thing called auto

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:33,480
die and auto died does a lot of the same

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:35,490
things that is winning okay want to talk

00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,130
about guards now right guards you're

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,700
thinking about stormtroopers mo

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:43,140
stormtroopers are not noted for

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:45,470
marksmanship that is failed what I'm

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:49,410
talking about guards is in the sense of

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,300
well that's crazy um don't don't mind

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,270
the hip hypnotic suggestions I've

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,340
embedded in here so what a guard is is

00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,470
basically a way to evaluate if certain

00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,270
piece of code should be executed and in

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,190
Erlang what you can do is tell it I have

00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,870
a function of era t2 which means I needs

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,130
two arguments and if it doesn't have two

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,780
arguments they won't match and

00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,520
furthermore you can be more specific and

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,990
say one of my arguments has to be an

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,880
integer in fact it has to be the first

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,590
one and if it is then execute this thing

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,630
below it and I can do that over and over

00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:21,630
and over again and at the bottom if it

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:24,050
doesn't match at all I can actually make

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:27,780
it crash and it'll send a bad bad argh

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:29,190
and that's very cool too i wish that

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,660
pearl could steal that because that

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,660
would really make pearl better thank you

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:52,209
hi everyone no can't hear me can you

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,190
hear me now thank you anyway for the

00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:55,930
past several years yep see has had a

00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,120
tradition of having bad movie night I'm

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:01,660
not sure how this started but Jeff cough

00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,070
and I wound up in charge so I know why

00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,399
that happened because we have all the

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,440
bad movies um so this year for the first

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:13,269
time bad movie night has been officially

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:15,160
scheduled biopsy it is happening at six

00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:17,649
o'clock so pretty much just after

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,680
lightning talks in Vandenberg hall in

00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:24,100
pile I'm sure you all know how to get to

00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,720
the pile center by now and I've been

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,060
told we cannot bring in food and drink

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:32,560
but we are allowed to steal the food and

00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:34,480
drink from the gamers so so you might

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,970
want to stop by the gaming room first

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,029
grab some food and then go to ban

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:43,420
Vandenberg anyway I have I have the

00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:45,730
movies we have projector uh I hope we

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,260
have speakers everything hopefully will

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,209
work out great and we'll have a great

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:54,240
time so if you want to join us for bad

00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:58,389
movie night six o'clock oh sorry seven

00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:02,519
six o'clock six o'clock after this in

00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:02,519
Vandenberg in the pile center thank

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,930
okay i was in zero the Pearl and I have

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,510
a Windows operating system you didn't

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,399
hear that anyway I had certain problems

00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:23,730
using the command line here is what I

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,730
learned and what I did about it see

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,149
three things administrative privileges

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,740
path and powershell powershell is

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,540
something someone recommended to me I

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,100
don't know anything about it I haven't

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,740
used it but I just put it up there in

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,029
case anyone does but the things that I

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,660
had to deal with were administrative

00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:45,070
privileges and paths I found out that if

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:49,630
you want to actually install something

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:51,670
from Sipan using the dos windows command

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,830
line you need administrative privileges

00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:57,130
which has become a little more

00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:59,680
complicated than it used to be just

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:03,910
logging on a Windows machine as an

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,459
administrator doesn't do it so for those

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,230
of you who have had this problem I know

00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:16,350
you're out there even though you won't

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:20,620
admit it you find your command line

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:22,380
somewhere see I have it I have it pinned

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:28,060
but I haven't pinned the new one yet

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:30,640
with the right privileges and anyway if

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:34,110
you found it I'll just pick one it

00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:37,110
doesn't matter works on everything oh

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,110
good

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:45,850
then you haven't seen my mistake yet

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:49,720
okay oh you can't see actually that

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:58,710
won't work so just do what it says there

00:12:49,720 --> 00:13:00,700
find it and click run as administrator

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:11,010
then from then on when you open the

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:11,010
command line and let's update required

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:31,690
then you get this and you ignore other

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:39,180
things okay this is interesting because

00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:41,860
then I can't see it from here okay half

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:44,620
their thing was you have to make sure

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,410
that perla is in your path variable so

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:50,889
from the command line you enter path no

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:54,010
spaces if you enter anything with spaces

00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:58,139
it will not work so if you need to add

00:13:54,010 --> 00:14:02,350
your path line you enter the new path

00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:05,410
semicolon and then % past percent will

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:12,360
not overwrite the rest of your paths

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:15,300
which would be very bad using quotes

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,610
once you have the pearl command line and

00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,970
you want to do something with it let's

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,970
see

00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:40,120
which I can't okay there we go I need to

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:40,120
go to wear my documents are which is

00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:24,300
there we go so now I can run it and

00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:28,010
anyway I have one minute okay you have

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:30,570
to you could use pearl with uh with

00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,010
switches but everything after it has to

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:35,510
be in double quotes not single quotes

00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:38,010
otherwise you get this error message

00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,750
running multiple commands you can run

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:42,270
them like this in double quotes if you

00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:46,320
want on the command line or you can

00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:49,500
actually use them as arguments there so

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,660
for the script the pearl coat in script

00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:56,160
0 will run using script 5 as its input

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,140
editor's this is where you set the pearl

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,250
language for each one of them this is

00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:05,430
how you open your dos command line I des

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:09,330
sorry I don't know active state Padre is

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:12,210
what i use use the run run command or

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,710
run run script or just click the forward

00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:16,680
arrow and you don't have to select the

00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:20,150
pearl syntax because it's written for

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,150
pearl and that's it

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:32,640
okay a real quick commercial here um I

00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,290
apologize for getting buck for

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,090
forgetting about the bad movie night but

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,060
that was going to be part of my thing so

00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:41,010
thank you very much for bringing that up

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,950
yes yes yes I was going to do that right

00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:47,070
now and then he mentioned food that you

00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:49,290
can steal from the gamers yes go ahead

00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,300
and steal it what it is is there will be

00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:54,120
a bar there similar to what was on top

00:16:51,300 --> 00:17:00,050
of the roof so there'll be soda wines

00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:02,340
and beer and water there will also be a

00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,949
cold-cut sandwich make your own sandwich

00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:10,980
out of cold cuts and various snack

00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:14,400
chippy things up there as well so so if

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,780
you guys you guys do need food and you

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,910
want to go straight from here to there

00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,560
but you're like banging I'm hungry you

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,199
there is food over there for you guys to

00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:24,089
eat as well as soon enjoy have a great

00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:33,690
conference see you guys tomorrow morning

00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:41,070
early now wait who's got the mic come

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:44,430
back with that mic oh okay hi I'm Andy

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:47,220
Lester this is uh Rob bails used to be

00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:51,660
here in Madison went away to Amsterdam

00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:54,870
Amsterdam booking.com amoo anyway we're

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,520
going to talk about act to the future we

00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,340
all have large trees the source code to

00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:06,090
search in the beginning there was fined

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:16,480
and grep and searching trees sucks

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:18,610
so i created ack ack does amazing things

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,170
act recognized a certain file types even

00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,780
specified dash dash pearl and get on

00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,820
with profiles it will recognize shebang

00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,250
lines in your scripts and and it does

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:30,310
the sentence Python PHP Ruby it ignores

00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:34,120
junk like your version control systems

00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:36,310
core dumps till the backup files it uses

00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,100
honest-to-god pearl regular expressions

00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:43,690
not pcre because we all know the sea and

00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:45,970
pcre is alive you can use actual dollar

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:49,300
variables like that one dollar ampersand

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:51,430
in your results so it's almost like

00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,920
using Perl from the command line it's

00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:56,710
portable so if you're somebody like Mary

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:59,350
who is on who is on Windows you can use

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,930
pearl or you can use a key zhilie even

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:06,430
though you have no other UNIX tools it's

00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:08,440
an easy install you can install from the

00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,730
sea pen from a package from a single

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,680
download that you can put in your bin

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,750
directory and carry around with you it

00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,030
has very pretty output it groups

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:19,750
everything all nicely all those colors

00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:22,240
are modifiable it has passed through

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,280
mode where it shows lines that don't

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,860
match so if you're tailing a log file

00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,110
for instance and you still want to see

00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,200
all the lines going by that don't match

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:34,420
you can do that most of all it's

00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,550
optimized for laziness one of the three

00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:39,430
virtues of a programmer typing greps

00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:43,320
llege switches is slow and all of your

00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:46,740
do-it-yourself aliases are not portable

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:49,420
best comment ever on hyper news once

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,660
defaults matter and that's what ACK is

00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:54,940
all about so it's popular it's useful it

00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:58,150
has so many contributors how many of you

00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:00,760
have contributed to act thank you for

00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:05,380
the web five six seven thank you I

00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:08,140
appreciate it however at oscam last year

00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:11,440
I ran into rob and we talked and he has

00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:14,290
been kicking ass helping me out get Eck

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,060
going and so now we want to talk about

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:18,060
Act two point oh

00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:29,950
take it away Rob all right as Andy

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,230
mentioned I'm Rob and I've been working

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,520
on an act to for last year so act 2

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,919
brings a couple features to the table

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,360
first of all it's less surprising when

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,520
you just run act for the first time in

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,320
your complete newbie what it does if you

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,909
don't specify any filters is surprising

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,620
to some so we decided to make it less

00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,230
surprising and do the right thing right

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:49,899
away without any switches and we also

00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:52,090
included switches for the old bader in

00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:54,970
act two you can have flexible file

00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:57,460
selections so instead of having all this

00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,750
up hard code you can add your own file

00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,789
selectors instead of having to submit a

00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,260
pull request on github so you can match

00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:04,210
based on the file name you can master

00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,010
page on this the shebang you can match

00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,340
based on the extensions and you can

00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,960
ignore files using the same rules

00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,390
another big feature is per project a car

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,270
see so you can have a doc RC file in

00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:18,340
your git repo and so that way if you

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,360
want it for example ignore XML files and

00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,070
all of your searches you can just say

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,299
yeah for this project we ignore XML

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,690
files and whenever you search in that

00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:28,330
project it does that it's going off

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:32,049
tonight that's that's assuming I don't

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:33,070
get too distracted at bad movie night so

00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:34,090
that doesn't sound like a lot of

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,240
features for a one year of development

00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,860
so the big deal about Act two point O is

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,770
its paving the way for what Andy not

00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:44,440
call act 2 X really act 2 dot X is going

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:46,059
to be a Perl interpreter file fat find

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,460
and a plug-in loader and that's all it's

00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:49,860
going to be and so yeah plugins so you

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,390
can do things like searching a tarball

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,830
theoretically the roads yet to be

00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:58,570
written but these are ideas thank you

00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:01,750
you can search a given committed to git

00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:04,750
repo you can only search on stage files

00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,370
in your gimmick in your git repo you can

00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,669
search for you can search text in a word

00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:13,240
or PDF as yet unwritten yeah these are

00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:15,429
all unread and you can only select file

00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,020
you can suck files only that are newer

00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:19,299
than 10 days old these are just ideas

00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,549
that we came up with kev fell hammer and

00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:23,799
I and we've all been talking about this

00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:26,679
last night up on the deck there's a lot

00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:30,100
of really great ideas and so if you if

00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:32,530
this is kind of interesting to you we

00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,440
you to join us go to better than grep

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:37,179
com that's the ACT homepage which also

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,330
has other tools which are better than

00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:42,280
grep act it's not the only one and you

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,260
can join us on the accuser's at Google

00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:54,039
Groups we'd love to have your help thank

00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:56,799
you as long as I'm up here my company is

00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:59,080
sponsoring a what we call engineers and

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,210
beards it's a to get together you know

00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,159
we basically you know have drinks and

00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,570
talk about booking so if you're

00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:06,610
interested in working for booking come

00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:10,679
join us and meet us in the lobby of this

00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,679
building a raft lightning talks thanks

00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,510
you

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,539
yay hi guys i am dave Lizewski also

00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,309
known to see x-ray i go online i'm gonna

00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,600
hijack my own talk so i've got actually

00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:45,570
two different subjects today sure

00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,460
something about smart CD I've smart TVs

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,020
a tool that I wrote as a library in bash

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,659
and z shell and that's the only shells

00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,789
right it lets you localize your

00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:56,909
environment and that's really clear to

00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:58,380
everybody right your environment for

00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:00,419
running programs has a you know

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,500
variables aliases shell functions do you

00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:03,029
use these things you might want to set

00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,909
them all for different projects whatever

00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:07,679
needs you might want to maybe set only

00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:11,250
for particular project well that can be

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,200
a real pain smart CD lets you do that so

00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,390
if I check my profile lib I don't have

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,970
one I seating my project now I've got a

00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:26,399
pro 5 lib I CD back to my home no more

00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:27,870
pro 5 lib opens automatically and is the

00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:32,580
source of aliases and functions so if I

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:34,350
go my project I run restart I go back

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,429
home norma restarick man this is really

00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:39,600
awesome because you can use the same

00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:43,049
aliases in all your projects yeah this

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,549
is cool now we have pro brew and her

00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:46,649
local lib and they sort of solve some of

00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:49,110
the same problems and they're really

00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:50,250
awesome and you should use them but you

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,440
know you have to put them in your global

00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,240
shell configuration or you have to

00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,529
enable them with a script or something

00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:02,460
you know let's mix so there's helpers

00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:05,159
that ship with smart cd14 pearl grew and

00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,260
one for local lib and you know they do

00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,059
all the magic for you all you've got to

00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,039
do is configure these to go to run when

00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:14,010
you enter your script and two great

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,299
tools work great together and they ship

00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:19,320
with the core so you don't have to

00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:20,880
download anything else and there's a fru

00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,870
Schmidt gave me this great idea he

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,460
actually did this person yeah it's

00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:29,659
definitely read me it's kind of a long

00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:34,039
block but it works pretty very well and

00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:34,039
that's the install give it a try

00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:44,190
and now sort of a hijacked my talk I was

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,200
thinking about something at work where

00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:50,610
we use agile and everybody loves agile

00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,860
right well now not everybody adults for

00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:56,040
making better software well no agile

00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,240
star making better products and our

00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,220
products mostly I'm word software

00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,290
delivers our software is in software our

00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,340
product is in software but that's really

00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,900
an implementation detail where the

00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,510
programmers we care about that the

00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:09,600
business just wants to product so proud

00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:11,250
a July product owners and gives them

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,570
visibility and control right because we

00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,160
are the programmers we have some

00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,049
visibility and control they kind of want

00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,020
some of that too so it's for them and

00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:20,280
that's okay because they're paying us

00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,929
but it's a series of short term thing

00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,360
exercises you know you're experimenting

00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:26,669
things see what works it's great for

00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,710
seeing what you like but it's not so

00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:31,559
good for engineering you know you've

00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:33,570
never engineer an airplane before you

00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:37,290
build the wings that's not engineering

00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:38,730
it's crafting but you know they are

00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,679
bosses like to call software engineers

00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:44,280
we're not engineers but we do like to

00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,840
pretend like we are and we're factoring

00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,220
works pretty well but you know it

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,720
depends when you were star trek factory

00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,299
if you made a big architectural mistake

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,660
that's going to cost you a lot so it

00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:55,950
helps to think ahead and you're going to

00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,540
want to do that when you know that the

00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,950
performance is going to matter but it

00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,630
doesn't always really matter and you

00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,540
know it matters to me but does it matter

00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:05,640
to the owners keep that in mind so you

00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:09,540
can build good software in spite of

00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:13,160
agile but you don't always have to just

00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,160
remember the product isn't the software

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:30,900
if anybody wants to give a commercial

00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:32,280
after an upcoming talk please one at the

00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,169
end of the talk when I turn around raise

00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,330
your hand I'll bring over microphone you

00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:38,850
can see the places you can come up and

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,830
then I and then you have 30 seconds to

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:44,510
talk about something that interests you

00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,510
and other people as well thank you

00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:58,620
alrighty so I'm going to talk today

00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,900
about recruiter Perl 6 i'm patrick leash

00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,000
on the head developer for bakudo Perl 6

00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,490
our big release was bakudo star released

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,990
in july 2010 the most common observation

00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,120
made about recruit of stars it was

00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:11,400
released then was that it was slow it

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,049
was really slow I mean it was really

00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,450
really slow we're going to see how slow

00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:17,309
it was so how slow was it here's a basic

00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,750
while loop now this while loop simply

00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:20,790
counts from zero to a hundred thousand

00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,530
does some additions and you time how

00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,790
long that takes in the version of

00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:27,299
recruiter released in january two

00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:28,350
thousand eleven that took 23 seconds now

00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:30,090
if you want to compare that against

00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,799
pro/5 pro/5 doesn't into hundreds of a

00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:35,100
second that's a factor of a thousand

00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:37,169
difference that's not exactly what we're

00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,760
hoping for so let's try changing it to a

00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:43,679
for loop for loop should be faster than

00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:45,299
a while loop right no right so kind of

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,650
going the wrong way there so let's just

00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:47,850
look at the basic startup time all you

00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,770
want to do start at the interpreter and

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,690
start doing things it takes six tenths

00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,190
of a second that's really not so good

00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,960
either so we weren't very happy about

00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,970
that so what should we do about all of

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,010
this we decided we needed to redesign

00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,660
many of the recruiter core internals we

00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,520
needed to implement a cleaner object

00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,200
metamodel which we call six model some

00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,760
better dispatch and type analysis make

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,049
it a core feature of n QE which is the

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,240
layer that we use to implement rokudo

00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:11,400
and then we would be able to win so

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,260
about the timings in this talk there are

00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,630
lies damn lies and benchmarks I'm giving

00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,460
you all in this talk all right you can

00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,290
argue about the timing methodology the

00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,090
things I've chosen to time but i think

00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,410
the end results are about the same so

00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,179
improvements over time we start in

00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,590
january 2011 parrot made some

00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,540
improvements we improve the method

00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:30,450
capabilities we added some profiling we

00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,730
got some better times then in so that

00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,049
brings us to july of last year then we

00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,289
did

00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:38,809
big changes we switched over to the new

00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:40,580
six model-based n QP a new reg ex engine

00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:41,690
some better iteration support a lot of

00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:46,659
new features and we got some better

00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:49,580
times that's as of January of this year

00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:51,320
so that makes us happy since January

00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,059
we've done even more better native type

00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,980
supports and bounded serialization

00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:56,929
refactored map iteration and we have

00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,220
still better times you can see that the

00:29:56,929 --> 00:30:01,519
times are going the direction that we

00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:03,830
want you can also do things in native in

00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,029
snow so if you just change the variables

00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,109
that you know are going to be integers

00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:08,149
and tell them that they're going to be

00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:09,590
int with a lowercase I then the compiler

00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:12,609
can optimize that to use registers

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,840
directly and you get even better times

00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:18,139
so we've done quite a bit better we're

00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,940
still not at Pearl 5 sorts of speeds but

00:30:18,139 --> 00:30:21,320
the factor is a lot better so here's

00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,489
some more license some more benchmarks

00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,350
when I see people talking about

00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:26,059
recruiter speed on the web and read it

00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,950
and everything like that they talk about

00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:29,570
Rick udo's startup time we've improved

00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:31,820
it but we're still not anywhere close to

00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,169
what pro 5 is able to do but there are

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,600
benchmarks and then there are damned

00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:37,519
lies so if you're just starting them up

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,869
yes rokudo is slow during the portal 6

00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:40,519
let's suppose you want to do something

00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:43,399
interesting like actually use classes

00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:46,220
right so in brick udo the time to start

00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:47,989
up is the same if you load knows oh wait

00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:52,999
a minute somebody's a little bit faster

00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:56,389
now let's say you want to use signatures

00:30:52,999 --> 00:31:00,109
oh wait hmm let's say you want to use

00:30:56,389 --> 00:31:05,749
multi methods oh my gosh do you use

00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:07,279
grammars oh so you can't exactly compare

00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:08,480
apples to apples by just saying the

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,190
startup time because when recruiter

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,590
starts you're getting a lot more for

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:14,570
free the key contributors that have made

00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,369
this happen the key culprits are listed

00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:18,019
here there have been many more our bus

00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:19,279
number has gone way up over the last

00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:21,619
year and I'm very very happy about that

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,359
we have better source code here's an

00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:26,330
example of what the source code looks

00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:28,159
like now so by language in january of

00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:29,899
last year you can see that most of it

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,580
was Pierre that's parrot language and

00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:32,989
then we also had a lot of it that's in

00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,789
Perl in another language that we call n

00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:36,769
QP that's really pro stick syntax there

00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:38,509
a little bit of sea as of our next

00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:40,009
release which will be next Tuesday you

00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:41,749
can see we've gotten rid of almost all

00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:44,090
of the pier less than two percent of our

00:31:41,749 --> 00:31:46,190
code is tied to pair it most of it is

00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,960
now and see a lot of it is in pearls

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:50,480
thank you p which is all perl 6 syntax

00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,639
the core metamodel pieces are written in

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,460
perl 6 which is the way that we want to

00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:56,870
have it to be and in fact the parts that

00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,139
are in Pierre none of that is in the

00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:01,129
recruiter source itself it's all in n QP

00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:03,980
there's a couple of other things we did

00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:06,440
over the past year in our spare time so

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,720
where we're going from here one of the

00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,190
downsides of going and redoing the

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,419
internals as much as we did we broke a

00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,009
lot of stuff for people who are trying

00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:14,929
to use for Kudo that was really really

00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:16,669
bad because you couldn't get things to

00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:18,039
work from one release to the next we are

00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:20,120
committed we're not doing that anymore

00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:21,440
now that we have gotten to the state

00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,789
with the new korn place we're very

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,259
comfortable it will be stable going

00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:26,299
forward so we're encouraging people to

00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:27,529
come and look at us again and we promise

00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:29,809
that the next we really smoke break

00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:31,549
whatever you did this month we're

00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:33,289
building better unwraps documentation

00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,850
we've already started a pearl dock

00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:37,220
equivalents called p6 stock it's out on

00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:39,200
github we're building user level guides

00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,570
and tutorials and we've got a features

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,360
matrix that is really really cool so let

00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:45,169
me see if I can pull it up there it is

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,519
so if you want to know what's

00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:48,110
implemented and what's not in the spec

00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:50,600
here are the two major implementations

00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:52,490
Kudo necha if it's green then that means

00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,570
we do it if it's orange or red that

00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,830
means we don't if you want to see an

00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,200
example of what we're talking about the

00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,549
links on the side it's really cool

00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,440
better packaging more speed improvements

00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:02,059
and enhanced libraries now for all the

00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,409
better down ramps and documentation we

00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:05,120
know the people currently working on

00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:06,679
Rikuo are the worst people at this we

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,210
want others to come in and tell us how

00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:09,529
to document things because we've been

00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,750
trying for three years and we failed

00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:13,700
utterly so anybody who's interested in

00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,259
in writing you don't have to be a code

00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,669
hacker will help you out it's one of the

00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,769
most friendly places in the world is on

00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:20,269
Perl 6 so we need more contributors that

00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:22,549
aren't the people who know what's going

00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:23,809
on we need documentation authors we'd

00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:25,370
love to see more modules and

00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:26,659
applications we need feedback if you

00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,549
want to know where to start you can go

00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:32,259
to pro 6 org there's tons of links there

00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:32,259
you can join us on freenode thank

00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,850
so one of the things that we start

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,050
thinking about when we're at EFC is

00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,520
where is he actually going to be next

00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:49,950
year because it's so awesome that you

00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,620
want to get ready to jump in for the

00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,850
next year and make your plans we had

00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,020
gotten into a mode where we tried to

00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,360
have that decision so that people could

00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,460
know by the end of the conference where

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,080
they would be going but it's really a

00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,280
lot of work even just putting the bid

00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,380
together and they haven't even done the

00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,730
apps yet so for this year what we've

00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,690
done we just put up an announcement

00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,610
we're going to extend the time line a

00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,780
little bit to July first because there's

00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:11,429
some other folks who wanted to get bids

00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,110
together so if you're still thinking

00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:14,220
about it or after having been here you

00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,450
think you might want to actually try to

00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,010
run one of these there's a little bit

00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:18,960
more time you've got about two weeks to

00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,550
put stuff together there's a talk

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,590
tomorrow that Dan right is giving on

00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:24,000
doing different kinds of events not just

00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:26,429
the absolutes but smaller events like

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,290
workshops which he's done a bunch of and

00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:29,550
there's a bob tomorrow at lunch it also

00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:31,080
is going to talk about events and

00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,220
specifically about Yahtzee so if you're

00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,360
interested you should check out those

00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,360
two things as well thank

00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:45,090
okay so test test anything protocol this

00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,940
is really good I think a lot of people

00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:50,310
don't understand just how good it is I

00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,840
mean if you're at just this level we've

00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:54,080
all kind of seen this if you've done any

00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,940
kind of insulation on a seat pan module

00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,400
just the very basic test numbering even

00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:02,370
at this level were actually already have

00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:05,130
more functionality than a lot of other

00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:07,410
libraries and other languages it just

00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,330
kind of gets stays out of your way and

00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:12,360
it's as simple as you need but it goes a

00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:14,910
lot more than that to skip and to do

00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,950
just the really nice way to get an

00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:20,310
automatic list of things that you need

00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:23,820
to get done later so and you can still

00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:25,800
commit stuff and not break the build so

00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:29,430
this is great way now what if you wanted

00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,890
to do this in j unit i suppose this

00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:35,790
crowd isn't going to brag on me too much

00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:37,920
if I raiganj a unit ok so I googled

00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:40,770
around sorry to our DuckDuckGo people I

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,280
googled around and I found out how to

00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:46,530
implement to do in j unit so here we go

00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,570
divine stare diamond implemented method

00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,460
throws a unique area type to find a

00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:52,710
board method throws a unique arrow type

00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,750
as well now create a test case class

00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,970
superclass with an overrated setup

00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,680
method which call setup implement its

00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:00,570
each sub class then defines its own

00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,790
setup impul the fine test listener

00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:04,860
defines an ad error method record

00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:06,420
results in separate buckets hook test

00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:12,330
listener into test runner and you're

00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:14,880
done the funny part the guy who posted

00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:16,770
this said afterwards I know this seems a

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:24,330
little insane but it's actually really

00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:25,650
flexible so how did this happen how this

00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:27,630
happen other than the fact that Java

00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:30,570
program is a brain damage what happened

00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:33,390
here java programmers create a library

00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:35,310
not a protocol the protocol can get in

00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:39,570
your way and you only get the stuff that

00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:42,750
you want so if you want to create a new

00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:43,860
library you don't want test more maybe

00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,630
that's not good enough for you you can

00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:47,100
tire test builder if that's not even

00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,660
good enough for you you can just spit

00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,000
out the protocol yourself if you really

00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,860
want to

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,090
blueant the wheel and it's not that hard

00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,010
but it's not just for pearl anymore

00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:59,230
either if you look at test anything or

00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:02,080
there's a wiki they're all about the tap

00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:04,180
protocol that list implementations for C

00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,610
and Haskell and javascript and PHP and C

00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,140
sharp and Java and pretty much every

00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:10,870
language you'd want to throw at it a

00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,610
nice thing is if you've got a big code

00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:14,800
base that combines a bunch of different

00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:16,390
languages you can now put tap in all of

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,370
them then if your boss wants a big

00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:22,000
report it all comes together and you can

00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:24,820
just use one format but it gets even

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,430
better for that there's deeper stuff in

00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,710
tap that a lot of people don't even know

00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:32,920
about like yeah mulish here it's almost

00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:36,250
yamo just kind of simplified form and it

00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:38,260
kind of has some default name value

00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:41,110
pairs that you can put into and then you

00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:43,570
have extended ones that you do this is

00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:45,310
complexity at no charge because if you

00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:48,310
don't care about ya know it still gets

00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:49,870
out of your way but if you want it you

00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:53,260
want to put this information into your

00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:56,740
report there you go but tap can be more

00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:58,420
gooder but one thing that just caught my

00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,850
eye while i was browsing around on the

00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,850
wiki is test groups and blocks these are

00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:06,220
different ways to running subtests its

00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:07,720
proposed on the test anything org wiki

00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,070
but it's kind of been neglected for a

00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,950
couple years and I'm hoping to get some

00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:13,600
discussion going on this so test groups

00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:16,900
it just kind of uses this dot notation

00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:20,260
to go through and then test blocks use

00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,820
indentation instead they both have kind

00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,260
of their pros and cons test groups you

00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,420
can have different processes being

00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,520
forked off and then you interleave the

00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,960
results and it all kind of works but it

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,240
kind of breaks backwards compatibility

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,130
more tests blocks you can't really do a

00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:35,620
single process output but it's a little

00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:38,170
bit prettier too I don't know what the

00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,970
right of way is I maybe there's a clever

00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,500
third option out there I'd love to see

00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,630
more discussion on this so though so

00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,930
just go to the wiki and take a look at

00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,930
it thanks

00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:06,300
hey everyone I'm giving a workshop

00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,880
tomorrow morning at 9am about putting it

00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,980
all together a whole bunch of beginner

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,100
stuff modern pill if you are coming

00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,350
please go and check the top description

00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,869
again about a week ago I put a whole

00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:21,450
bunch of prerequisites and a file for

00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:22,680
you to download on that page please go

00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:24,660
and do all that so that you're not

00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,250
spending all the tutorial just

00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:36,330
downloading and installing moose for

00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:38,130
example thank you alright hi folks um so

00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,240
I'm talking about web simple this is the

00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,070
thing it's been around for a little

00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,150
while Matt trout has talked about in the

00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,830
past but I don't think enough people

00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:46,710
know about it so I'm talking about it

00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:51,590
too I'm Andrew you might know me as

00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:54,150
Hobbes online that's a Flying Dog um so

00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:56,310
it's a web framework we have enough of

00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:58,800
those right what's cool about what's

00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:01,200
cool about web simple it's got really

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,359
minimal dependencies besides plaque it's

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,300
got no excess dependencies which means

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:09,480
if you are just like deploying a script

00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:11,160
to web server on ftp it's cool you can

00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,020
do that you don't need to soup an

00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,510
anything you can fat pack whatever you

00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:17,220
want into a single file you can write an

00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:19,200
app that's a single file you don't need

00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,960
to like do some scaffolding and have a

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,240
class and controllers and whatnot you

00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,400
are and you don't pay for what you don't

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,460
use if you will if you don't have

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,350
anything that matches URL query

00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,480
parameters then the URL query parameters

00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:35,609
in your requests don't even get parsed

00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,369
it's really based on what you're using

00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:40,230
and in a given request and because of

00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:43,410
all these things it's fast enough for

00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:46,109
CGI which is really actually like we say

00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:48,060
CGI is dead but sometimes you're just

00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:50,220
doing really something really simple and

00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,810
you need to throw it up there and CGI is

00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,640
what you want because you don't want to

00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,869
screw around with web server deployment

00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,380
and whatever else you don't want your

00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,720
app

00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,299
memory all the time when somebody might

00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,789
hit it once a year so like web simples

00:41:00,299 --> 00:41:06,450
loads an entire app in a tenth of a

00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:10,259
second so you can do CGI with us um it's

00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:13,160
also um one of the first frameworks

00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:16,500
nearly the only one that is native to

00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,690
psg I it has come out after psg i was

00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,119
around so it can be designed around that

00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:23,789
and there's some cool things about that

00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,970
including ability to sub dispatch to psg

00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:28,619
I apps and middleware and I'm going to

00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:30,839
come back to those but right now so

00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:33,599
here's here's a nap and in honor of Matt

00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:37,640
trout the creator of web simple this is

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:40,259
the MST o matic cgi from his website

00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,660
re-implemented um so this is just

00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:45,450
showing you a little bit of the

00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:48,150
boilerplate around it use web simple it

00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:49,619
imports mu import strictures which is

00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,440
like strict and warnings and a couple

00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:54,029
other things that you don't want to do

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,980
and whatever else and so here's that

00:41:54,029 --> 00:41:57,539
here's the app and I apologize it's a

00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:00,480
little bit small but here's your here's

00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:04,019
your dispatcher and it's going to answer

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,579
two /em st o matic HTML and json with

00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:07,230
different content types and i'm not

00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:09,480
going to go into the details but this is

00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:11,730
a it's a psg I app it's a web simple

00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:16,410
this entire thing works it needs a data

00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:19,140
file so it's a to file app um and so if

00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:21,019
you wanted to take this app and add some

00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:24,720
middleware to it maybe you want a gzip

00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:27,869
like I said we're PSG eyewear if you

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,910
write a route that returns a middleware

00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:31,559
than anything that matches after that

00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:33,210
gets wrapped in that middleware so now

00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:35,940
we're going to gzip for any browsers

00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:39,690
that support it if you write a route

00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:41,759
that returns a key SGI app then anything

00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:44,849
that matches that is going to get

00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:47,160
dispatched to that app and the slash dot

00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:49,319
dot means take off this path component

00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,000
and give remaining path components to

00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:53,490
plaque app directory so now I have a

00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,200
file browser big gaping security hole in

00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:59,820
the middle of my app

00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,560
um a web simple is in use in production

00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:03,839
presenting parole the website where you

00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:07,099
can see the videos from lots of Y axes

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,510
and pro workshops runs on web simple

00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:11,490
shutterstock labs so the shutterstock is

00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:13,380
my employer we're using web simple for

00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:17,220
one of our components in production as

00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:19,050
well um it's there's some useful

00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,900
features you can test your act from this

00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:23,490
from the CLI a lot like CGI used to be

00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,970
able to support where you can run your

00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:29,910
app with a URL and params and content on

00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:31,770
the command line it's there's a run test

00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:33,990
request method which integrates with uh

00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:36,630
with plaque tests to automatically

00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:39,300
create mock tests and some of the

00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:41,700
features the the dispatcher supports

00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:44,040
capturing path parts with names it

00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,780
supports file uploads the routes I'm not

00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,160
going to go into detail on them here but

00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:49,140
they're actually kind of like Perl 6

00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:52,380
method signatures with support for

00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:54,839
optional and slurpee and whatnot and if

00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:57,119
you want to generate static files from

00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:58,980
your app there's there's a cool feature

00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,170
for that to web dispatches the

00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:03,119
dispatcher you can separate it if you

00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:05,369
don't like the fact that web simple uses

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,550
insanity on subroutine prototypes you

00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:10,260
can get rid of that web dispatch HTTP

00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:13,140
methods Jane app wrote that and it makes

00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:17,270
web dispatch rest here we're on IRC at

00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,270
IRC org web simple and

00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:28,230
so this is this is that command line

00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:35,640
feature there's a dot HTML there's the

00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:38,280
dot JSON I can take I can take the same

00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:42,450
exact same exact script pass it to

00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:45,950
plaque up go here and it's running

00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:49,550
there's my address bar localhost 5,000

00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:49,550
that's web simple

00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:04,950
anybody want a commercial I know you

00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:09,210
guys like hearing me talk so I just keep

00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:11,040
coming up at the game night JT just

00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:14,490
called him wanted me to tell everybody

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:16,830
that they're the first hundred people

00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:19,530
that chopped a game night can get a deck

00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:22,710
of cards with this cool symbol on the

00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:26,550
front and it's in a nice plastic case

00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:30,330
donate by game crafter and the second

00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:32,580
thing is the next 300 people will also

00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:34,680
get a deck of cards there's pirate cards

00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,240
there's big game cards so if you know

00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,700
somebody who needs like the number nine

00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,400
this big when they're doing cards huge

00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:44,370
game cards and then can't remember what

00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,400
the third deck is but there are 400

00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:49,740
decks that they're giving away and each

00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,650
deck is a little bit unique so first

00:45:49,740 --> 00:46:01,710
hundred can get a one with the Pearl on

00:45:52,650 --> 00:46:03,780
it so thank you guys again yeah hi my

00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:06,840
name is Gavin Sabo and the title of this

00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:09,000
talk is a selling duct tape actually the

00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,380
original title of disk opens marketing

00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,630
duct tape but I I know that some people

00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:16,110
in this audience orbit worried about

00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:18,930
this word so I decided my much better

00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:20,190
name probably so I was talking to a

00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,540
couple of people and you're talking

00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:24,990
about the fact that it would be

00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:26,580
important to market duct tape and I know

00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:29,640
that there are many many duct tape users

00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:32,070
in this in this room now the main

00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,980
question that was asked is why why would

00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:37,650
anyone want to sell or market duct tape

00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,870
and there are a couple of answers so

00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:42,810
there are some people have been talking

00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:45,030
about marketing duct tape but most of

00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:48,030
the sea people were either selling books

00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:50,130
about duct tape or training classes or

00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:52,410
video classes you might recognize some

00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:54,720
of the names here of the object of these

00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:58,490
classes include the modern tired up clip

00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,650
so that's one of the

00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:05,480
of the deal but obviously these people

00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:07,820
have some advanced more people would use

00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:10,670
duct tape so there still remains the

00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:13,580
question why would you just duct tape

00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:15,260
users would not want to market more duct

00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,780
tape so i was thinking about it and I

00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,880
came up with two reasons one of them is

00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:23,150
with you because you won't like we want

00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,950
to help other people using duct tape so

00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:27,590
you know that you can use duct tape for

00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:32,600
various tools and you can use it for

00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:34,130
very helpful things so that's one of the

00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,200
reasons you would like because you know

00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:38,600
that duct tape is very powerful and you

00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,670
can help other people the other reason

00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,530
is that you would like to be appreciated

00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:44,960
so you're really fed up by people

00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:47,180
telling you and are you still using duct

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:52,400
tape now everyone is using oil or

00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:54,410
already snake oil it's much cleaner so

00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,750
you're you're fed up is that you would

00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:59,960
prefer to the people they'll tell you

00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:02,630
that oh I I think your duct tapes so

00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,460
nice so you can create nice things with

00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:10,359
your duct tape I would like to use that

00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:10,359
too or you want people to say that

00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:21,410
you're so good inducted the please fix

00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:23,210
my computer so the question comes up how

00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:24,890
can you how can you mark your duct tape

00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:26,869
and I was searching the internet how can

00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:30,260
you market duct tape and I found a book

00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:33,580
about it and I said that i'm going to

00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,580
buy it so I about to go

00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:39,440
and I read the book and and I found out

00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,330
actually that this this was the first

00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,640
book about marketing i read about

00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:46,610
marketing that actually made sense and

00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,930
it had three major issue that i would

00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:50,210
really recommend to everyone read this

00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:53,210
book but there were three major points

00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:54,950
of how to market duct tape and the thing

00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:58,280
is that you would like to get people to

00:48:54,950 --> 00:49:01,400
know about it lock the duct tape to like

00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,619
it and to trust it so how can you do

00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,510
that that's what you would like ice so

00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:09,320
one of this is things is that you are if

00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:11,869
you're a company using doctor you should

00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,550
talk about it okay and there are

00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:15,740
companies and you know this company that

00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:18,920
talks about a lot even though they are

00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:22,369
not selling duct tape then you can do

00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:24,470
really cool things and if you do nice

00:49:22,369 --> 00:49:27,650
things we stock tip people you like it

00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:29,720
and finally you can make useful things

00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:32,300
and they can get they can trust your

00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:36,320
duct tape and they will use it in their

00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:39,109
office so if you are doing this and the

00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:41,600
end you can set up your local duct tape

00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:45,770
monger group and as you can see in this

00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:49,250
picture in the middle you can see a an

00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:52,070
old pro longer who is converted to be a

00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:54,800
duct tape mongerer and as you can see

00:49:52,070 --> 00:50:01,750
the diversity of this group is much

00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:01,750
better thank you very much

00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:40,120
all right so no ads okay so I'm going to

00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,970
talk about some stuff I made my name's

00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:44,800
Dave roll ski I'm dark and IRC and

00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:46,750
basically I'm just going to talk about

00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,910
some modules I wrote so shameless

00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:51,490
self-promotion but I feel like Gabor was

00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:55,270
really tough act to follow so just lower

00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:57,700
your expectations that's all I ask so

00:50:55,270 --> 00:51:00,070
basically the stuff that I'm talking

00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,960
about just just some see points in Sipan

00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:05,170
modules I've written I've written a lot

00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,850
of CPM modules and some of them you're

00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:09,610
probably familiar with like daytime and

00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:11,170
some like nobody has probably ever heard

00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:12,640
of and I kind of realize this i was

00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:13,830
talking to john smarts the other day and

00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,990
it was like oh i wrote this module

00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:18,280
database migrator and he's like oh I

00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,050
didn't know you wrote that that actually

00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,400
sounds useful so maybe other people will

00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:23,080
think that or maybe John's just the

00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:27,070
idiot and the rest of your feel like

00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:28,570
this is crap we'll find out so I'm sure

00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:31,360
many of you have had to deal with

00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:33,970
migrating data bases particularly you

00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,710
know if you're doing this for a nap and

00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:38,530
you have a bunch of developers you want

00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:40,540
to make a schema change it's you know

00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:42,730
something you you write and rewrite and

00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:44,850
rewrite it every job and every new app

00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:48,040
you have so this is kind of a little

00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:50,050
framework for doing these migrations it

00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,880
doesn't do too much so it's not too

00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:55,540
opinionated so hopefully it'll be useful

00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:57,760
for a lot of people so it's able to

00:51:55,540 --> 00:52:00,310
create a database from a schema file it

00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,440
also can take migrations and apply them

00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:03,850
you supply the migrations it doesn't do

00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,400
anything we're a fancy a migration is

00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:08,410
just like a directory that has a name

00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,820
and that's the name of the migration and

00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:12,010
then in that directory you have some

00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:13,490
files and the files can be sequel or

00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:15,140
they can be Perl code

00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:17,450
and then the Perl code is actually run

00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:19,010
in the same process as the migrator and

00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:20,450
it gets past the migrator and called his

00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:22,460
method on the migrator which is kind of

00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:23,990
nice because then the migrator can

00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:26,030
supply you with the credentials to

00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:28,130
connect to the database or a database

00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:29,420
handle and they're just stories that the

00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:30,890
fact that it ran the migration the

00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:32,900
database next time you run the migrator

00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:36,650
will not reapply those migrations very

00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:39,920
simple stuff so basically the way it

00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:42,140
works is you write a subclass or you

00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,020
write a class yeah some class of one of

00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:46,250
the database specific migrators you

00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,840
provide it with a little extra

00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:50,090
information like you can tell it your

00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:52,010
database name and then you can write

00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:53,090
this little command-line script you

00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:55,760
don't have to write the command line

00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:57,290
script this is using a moose X get up by

00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,240
the way to handle the command line stuff

00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:02,330
that's where that new with options comes

00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,860
from and you can just run it directly

00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:05,630
from some other piece of code if you

00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:07,430
have some merger framework that does

00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:09,650
installs or whatever so it's really

00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:11,810
really pretty simple and this is

00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:13,100
basically based on some code we're using

00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:14,840
it work although we're not actually

00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,910
using it at work but I'm going to going

00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:20,030
to make us do that it's basically the

00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:22,369
same code so right now it only supports

00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:24,080
my sequel that's a that's a sad face

00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:28,940
because my sequel is just the saddest

00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:30,530
 thing ever yeah it's just like

00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:33,920
you know take a cheap shot for a plus

00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:36,350
right oh we're using my single work not

00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,910
my choice i came into it i would like to

00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:39,590
add support for a real database like

00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:41,210
post grass and you know those of you

00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:43,100
unfortunate suckers who have to use

00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:45,470
oracle or whatever can add support for

00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:47,570
that adam adding a new database support

00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:50,210
is really really simple the my sequel

00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:52,609
driver as it were as maybe 70 lines it's

00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:54,560
really nothing alright another module

00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:57,640
we'll see how many i get to before i get

00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:01,490
gone so wrote this thing called module

00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:03,170
implementation and basically it's for

00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:05,060
those cases where you're writing

00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:06,770
something for Sipan where you have

00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:09,410
multiple implementations but the end

00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:11,030
user doesn't care which one you pick the

00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:12,380
a really common case for some of the

00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:16,580
stuff I've worked on is we have an

00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:17,630
excess or a procure the all right

00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,310
I'm just going to start speaking

00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:22,160
gibberish for the rest of this stock the

00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:23,250
word all right so you have an excess or

00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,840
a pure

00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:27,760
implementation the end user just wants

00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:30,670
something to work it doesn't they don't

00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,650
really care so we want to try the access

00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:34,570
version if that was installed because

00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:35,980
the the Installer had a compiler great

00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:38,619
we'll use that will go a little faster

00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:40,930
otherwise we do use the pre or pearl

00:54:38,619 --> 00:54:43,510
it's pretty simple so it just tries to

00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:45,130
load them it stops when on the first one

00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:46,720
it loads and it copies the relevant

00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:48,520
symbols from the one it loads into the

00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,650
main model so it's already on us on

00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,420
Sipan in class load and probably few

00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:55,359
other things and so it might be useful

00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:56,830
for you so I decided much it so this is

00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:58,330
going to be cheating because I was doing

00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:01,270
things I did in the last year this is

00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:03,340
more than a year old coryell which is a

00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:05,890
the French word for email because French

00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:09,490
people like to make up words to keep the

00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:11,530
language pure so it's just an email

00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:13,090
parser and creator and I think it has a

00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:15,010
better API than some of the stuff out

00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:16,660
there and I think other people are

00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:18,040
actually using this because it a shin

00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:21,010
alee they asked me questions so I think

00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:23,080
that's a good sign and so you can parse

00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:25,119
an email get a bunch of nation about it

00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:28,210
you can build an email it's got a kind

00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,680
of fluid email building interface this

00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:32,170
is kind of every feature it supports

00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,240
headers attachments plain body plain

00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:37,600
text body HTML bodies with embedded

00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:39,310
images all that stuff and that's that's

00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,810
a kind of it it's been kind of a slow

00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:43,350
year for me so I don't have anything

00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:43,350
else to time

eventually here doesn't matter getting

00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:36,829
that's overrated try that's what I want

00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:39,829
to talk about so this is caching system

00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:42,319
chai it's kind of a unified caching air

00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:43,640
face oh if anyone wants unicorns at any

00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:46,540
point during the talk just shout

00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:46,540
unicorns

00:56:51,640 --> 00:57:03,349
I'm unicorn okay so any point you want

00:56:58,459 --> 00:57:05,390
unicorns so you could do chai driver

00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:06,319
Romain Rach I Drive fast memory tried to

00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:07,279
ever reach us there's all these

00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,809
different drivers you can hook to

00:57:07,279 --> 00:57:09,979
anything up to chai it's awesome you

00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:11,329
know homie right drivers it's kind of

00:57:09,979 --> 00:57:17,109
the point of this up go home and write

00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:19,400
Charlie drivers so now most of you guys

00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:21,969
most you guys okay a lot of you guys are

00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:25,069
smart but most of you aren't very smart

00:57:21,969 --> 00:57:30,910
you can store data other places them on

00:57:25,069 --> 00:57:30,910
a disk or or in memory or in the cloud

00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:47,410
does anyone know what protocol 0 is and

00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:47,410
in in the tcp/ip Internet thank you icmp

00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:56,749
King as part of ICMP at a talk last

00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:58,249
actually shocked people we're talking

00:57:56,749 --> 00:58:01,549
about well you got a story here it goes

00:57:58,249 --> 00:58:03,709
around 80 this old idea this is part of

00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:05,660
me any app it's a mercury relay storage

00:58:03,709 --> 00:58:07,249
tube they transmitted a signal to

00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:09,049
Richard he was saluted down it bounced

00:58:07,249 --> 00:58:10,759
off the other and it came back and they

00:58:09,049 --> 00:58:11,869
could the signal and when they happen to

00:58:10,759 --> 00:58:13,579
get the bit that they wanted they

00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:15,920
returned it oh I said be transmitted it

00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:21,769
has anyone figured out where I'm story

00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:26,180
an idiot I need a button on my nose

00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:27,920
controller for unicorns I might have to

00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:30,309
I might have to go without unicorns for

00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,309
a minute here

00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:47,819
so very important things you have to do

00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:49,999
do do otherwise it doesn't work because

00:58:47,819 --> 00:58:54,180
you can't send icmp s unless your route

00:58:49,999 --> 00:58:58,109
you have to crank up the ICMP rate limit

00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:59,940
as high as it'll go you have to decide

00:58:58,109 --> 00:59:11,160
which IP address are going to send all

00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:14,009
of your all of your your data to this is

00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:16,739
a live demo I pushed right and and we're

00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:17,729
going to have a live demo here I'm not I

00:59:16,739 --> 00:59:20,130
don't think I actually got on the

00:59:17,729 --> 00:59:21,930
Internet no I did know what passed

00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:23,099
respiration if we get any okays here

00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,930
there aren't cache misses and we're

00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:30,450
actually on the Internet otherwise we're

00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:40,849
not not to find was that's a cache miss

00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:43,829
this this will take a minute oh there's

00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:49,410
more outside the side software we're

00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:51,839
temporarily outside the slider anyway I

00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:53,789
don't think around internet but on a

00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:56,009
good day on a good day you'll get you'll

00:59:53,789 --> 00:59:57,960
get a healthy dose of passing tests so

00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:59,969
this thing works for some definition of

00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:02,160
working in fact on a really good day

00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:05,599
with a good connection almost almost

01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,599
half the tests will pass

01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:12,160
bars pretty low here in the best-case

01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:14,320
scenario you take a host out in the

01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:18,220
worst case you you transmit all of your

01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:19,930
private user data to someone else module

01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:23,380
why are you even thinking you're not

01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:25,660
don't use this module um ok a few few

01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:28,150
shouts out here I also wrote shy driver

01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:30,010
handler socket handler socket screams

01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:31,960
it's a it's a really low level interface

01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:34,030
to to my sequel we used to do simple row

01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:36,250
level operations without all the you

01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:39,910
ever had a sequel I don't like sequel

01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:42,460
either use it for work too so we kind of

01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:44,410
kind of have to put up with it and that

01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,640
was a huge improvement i would i would

01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:47,290
tell you the number but you wouldn't

01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:49,810
even believe me how many times faster

01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:52,870
this is the entire driver dbi and it's

01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:55,420
not try driver GBI's class are a problem

01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:58,270
it's it's just a handle of sockets I

01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:01,030
cool my slides from the Pearl SEL talk

01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:03,100
are online the last thing has a link to

01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:07,570
this presentation software if anyone

01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:10,930
wants unicorns and I have to thank plain

01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:13,120
black for well among the other wonderful

01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:14,470
things I've done a handler socket chai

01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:18,750
driver handler socket was written on

01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:18,750
company time thank you everyone

01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:30,010

q cells everywhere and I'm here to talk

01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:57,130
about windows before I get started

01:05:55,749 --> 01:06:00,039
though I'm going to give you a few of my

01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:06,670
unqualified I've personally owned five

01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:08,229
windows machines I will code in lolcat

01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:10,449
as long as it keeps me out of the

01:06:08,229 --> 01:06:17,529
restaurant business 20 years was too

01:06:10,449 --> 01:06:19,959
long and i have my own logo so why am I

01:06:17,529 --> 01:06:22,269
here spouting heresy about Windows last

01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:24,249
year at Yap see I believe somebody

01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:26,140
mentioned active state and then all

01:06:24,249 --> 01:06:27,670
around me they're a bunch of groans and

01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:29,619
people making that the horn just award

01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:33,039
against the devil and I just thought

01:06:29,619 --> 01:06:34,689
that doesn't seem very smart and that it

01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:37,180
happened to get at PP w when g fat

01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:40,689
mention that they coded on windows and

01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:43,589
annette so i was like well maybe i need

01:06:40,689 --> 01:06:46,059
to talk about this and do something so

01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:53,279
quick show of hands when did you learn

01:06:46,059 --> 01:06:53,279
how to program college high school

01:06:54,119 --> 01:07:04,209
junior high grade school did you learn

01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:07,019
on the same machine in the same language

01:07:04,209 --> 01:07:07,019
that you're using now

01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:18,250
I learned to code on the trs-80 model 3

01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:28,640
that's not me but I did have that

01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:31,240
haircut in that shirt so what's the

01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:34,480
point of when you learn how to program

01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:38,660
the point is you work with what you got

01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:40,730
well most people got is windows what

01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:42,920
they got the kids these days that were

01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:45,680
like us they've got a way to learn

01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:47,390
Python nodejs Java they're not filling

01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:49,460
around right in DD character sheets

01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:51,650
they're not making extra tiles for gev

01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:53,320
they're not making little blips go

01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:55,550
across the screen with the arrow keys

01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:58,940
they're able to create a fully

01:07:55,550 --> 01:08:02,900
functioning program that might have some

01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:05,380
market marketability so my youngest is

01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:07,640
my second strike i'm talking upon now um

01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:10,400
my youngest told me he wanted to learn

01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:13,280
how to program so i bought him a macbook

01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,200
um because i don't trust a 12 year olds

01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:20,090
12 year old with a Windows machine on

01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:22,070
the internet but I went looking to see

01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:23,300
what I could find for teaching pearl and

01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:25,250
I didn't really find anything kid

01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:27,290
applicable but i did find adventure on

01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:28,940
computer games was python and it teaches

01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:31,000
the same things that I learned what I

01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:34,160
learned when I was a kid hangman

01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:37,490
tic-tac-toe to guess the dragon game

01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:39,410
which entrance is going to kill you so i

01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:40,790
got this form and then said it helped

01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:42,680
them set it up so the heat you learn how

01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:46,490
to start programming python is a start

01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:48,110
but i don't mention the book because

01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:49,880
it's a good book although it is i

01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:53,630
mentioned it because the author al

01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:54,590
Swaggart gets it he says i'm going to

01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:57,650
give you instructions for installing

01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:59,720
python on Microsoft Windows not because

01:08:57,650 --> 01:09:01,880
that's my favorite operating system but

01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:06,230
because chances are that's the operating

01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:08,630
system you are running look around the

01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:12,410
room we're not getting any younger or

01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:14,300
prettier we need fresh faces we need new

01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:15,980
blood we need younger bodies we need to

01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,510
get those kids in grade school and

01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:20,570
junior high we need to get them

01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:22,520
interested in Perl we need to get them

01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:25,880
to drink the flavor aid

01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:27,350
but they're using Windows and they're

01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,060
not going to be interested if every time

01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:31,490
we bring up windows in the pearl group

01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:39,940
somebody shouts it weighs the same as a

01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:42,350
duck so what's next how do we fix this

01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:47,480
first of all we have to acknowledge that

01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:50,120
Bill Gates is not the devil okay windows

01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:52,609
is not some nefarious hell spawn from

01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:55,280
the deepest pits of hell instead we need

01:09:52,609 --> 01:10:00,110
to treat gates like a Colombian drug

01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:02,090
lord and view windows is the gateway

01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:10,630
drug that will eventually lead to

01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:10,630
something harder thank

01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:04,770
display protect Hey oops

01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:14,690
ah

01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:25,710
try down what

01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:42,070
so since we're pimping p.m. groups on a

01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:44,170
pimp D CPM like Washington DC and come

01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:46,000

01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:47,620
month we have a meeting we hope I'd have

01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,060
guest speakers you're going to have to

01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:50,770

01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:52,840

01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:40,120
ok we'll see if this works ytf p.m. my

01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:43,270
name is dawn Wallace I am the current

01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:48,580
organizer for Baltimore p.m. the pro

01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:50,560
mongers group in Baltimore I took it

01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:54,250
over because the guy who did run it

01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:56,800
moved to work for booking calm and I'd

01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:59,620
already volunteered to help organize DC

01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,090
BPW the d.c Baltimore for a workshop and

01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:03,640
I knew that if somebody didn't take it

01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:06,130
over Baltimore p.m. would die and then

01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:08,469
we'd have this DCB pw and there would be

01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:10,630
no Baltimore so what would the B stand

01:13:08,469 --> 01:13:14,830
for so I took it i'm glad i did it was

01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:20,620
good but it had me wondering a couple

01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:25,660
things WTF and y TF the WTF was what the

01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:28,810
 is a monger and so I decided I'd

01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:30,489
look it up and I went to two sites i

01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:31,719
went to dictionary com where i got a

01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,890
definition and i went to the place I

01:13:31,719 --> 01:13:35,270
like to go when I need to know something

01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:43,310
which is urban dictionary back

01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:50,160
and uh hello okay so when you look it up

01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:52,560
yeah so short for whoremonger one who

01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:54,900
frequents and prostitutes all

01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:59,520
right that sounds okay I guess it

01:13:54,900 --> 01:14:02,250
depends on your audience um show someone

01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:04,470
who mongers something um fishmonger

01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:11,160
ironmonger whoremonger ass monger

01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:12,420
monger alright so it goes on one who

01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,840
enjoys hoarding things are accumulating

01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:20,040
stuff okay a carnivorous African

01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:23,820
kangaroo with three rows of teeth it

01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:25,640
usually eats its prey in one bite anyway

01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:31,320
it goes on and on and it's quite awesome

01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:32,880
so but after that I thought why TF like

01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:36,570
why the are we calling ourselves

01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,650
mongers but then I was like well maybe I

01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:39,780
should check a better source let's see

01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:41,850
what dictionary says a person who is

01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:46,380
involved with something in a petty or

01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:48,030
contemptible way that's probably not the

01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:50,220
one we were going for but maybe because

01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:52,920
I've been to a couple yaps news now and

01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:55,440
so maybe but I think more we were going

01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:57,570
for a dealer in our trader of but nobody

01:14:55,440 --> 01:15:00,330
I don't know how many people here other

01:14:57,570 --> 01:15:02,250
than you know the people who have been

01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:04,710
here for a long time or whoever made the

01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:06,270
munger you know you ever classified US

01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:08,460
as mongers how many of you knew what the

01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:11,190
 a monger was come on be honest

01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:12,930
monger really okay and did anybody think

01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:18,720
that it was a monger a smog or

01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:20,760
whoremonger anyway right okay so i don't

01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:24,000
know i see this is a problem and as the

01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:26,610
new organizer for Baltimore p.m. I feel

01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,530
like I'm not getting any waggers a

01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:29,940
smog record loggers that are meeting I'm

01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:31,850
actually getting genuine people who are

01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:34,590
interested in pearl which is cool and

01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:36,690
I'm also genuinely interested in pearl

01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:39,060
and I would like to get more people at

01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:41,400
my meetings but I've only got about five

01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:45,090
on average that show up and most of them

01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:46,800
are here which is quite awesome but it

01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:48,810
made me start thinking p.m. equals

01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,970
Pro monger and that doesn't look like a

01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:52,890
happy person so you try to get people

01:15:50,970 --> 01:15:54,330
who aren't in this audience to come to

01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:56,340
your groups which what I'm trying to do

01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:57,840
is to get people who aren't here to cut

01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,740
and if you are here come on down if

01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,600
you're in Baltimore if you're in that

01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:01,980
area fine but other people that maybe

01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,570
aren't programming in perler don't know

01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:06,420
as much about Pearl I'd like to come to

01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:08,010
my meetings so they might say what's

01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:11,520
your grip call and I'm like oh we're the

01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:13,080
PM where the perl mongers and then

01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:16,980
people are like oh let me look that up

01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:19,020
and you know what they say so why would

01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:20,790
they come to my meeting they

01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:22,230
don't come to my meeting in fact a few

01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:24,420
 of so they're going to come to

01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:26,220
my meeting three and they don't

01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:34,530
I've got all this extra pizza and then I

01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:36,480
get fat so what do I propose okay use

01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:37,800
people who about stuff they like

01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,290
to complain a whole lot but they never

01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,940
do a thing about it yeah so

01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:45,000
let's fix it yeah you hit mongers

01:16:41,940 --> 01:16:46,440
 mongers right so I've come up

01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,020
with some words that start with M I

01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:50,850
thought about it the other day

01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:53,070
mercenaries meeting which is sort of

01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:54,900
weak masters mastery matters mavens

01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:56,670
messengers missionaries mission there's

01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:59,040
so many words that start with M

01:16:56,670 --> 01:17:00,900
we could definitely revolutionize this

01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:03,060
 am I the only person that thinks

01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:05,220
perl mongers is outdated and needs to be

01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:14,370
updated we need to rename the

01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:18,480
mongers yes yes yes okay we could do it

01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:20,370
yeah once we rename once we rename the

01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,480
perl mongers to whatever the you

01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:22,860
want to put behind those question marks

01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:25,260
because we've already got the PM

01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:26,820
namespace right so let's keep that then

01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:28,500
we're going to have ourselves some happy

01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:30,900
people that were like oh yeah i want to

01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:35,790
go to that new the pearl mood of the

01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:41,840
meeting so potty mouth well but it has

01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:41,840
to start with an m that's all I got

01:17:51,289 --> 01:18:00,949

01:17:56,730 --> 01:18:04,739

01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:17,460
Wednesday or the thursday of the third

01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:19,980

offer you only one tip for future

01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:51,960
participation would be it the long-term

01:18:50,219 --> 01:18:54,480
results of participation have been

01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:56,190
proved by scientists whereas the rest of

01:18:54,480 --> 01:19:00,119
my advice has no basis more reliable

01:18:56,190 --> 01:19:03,070
than my own meandering experience I will

01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:05,560
dispense this advice now

01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:08,290
enjoy the power and beauty of your

01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:10,240
community oh never mind you will not

01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:13,180
understand the power and beauty of your

01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:15,880
community until they have faded but

01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:17,890
trust me in six months you'll look back

01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:22,120
in your version control system and

01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:25,270
recall in a way you can't grasp now how

01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:28,900
much possibility labor for you and how

01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:32,830
fabulous your roadmap really was you're

01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:34,480
not as buggy as you imagined don't worry

01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:37,930
about the number of contributors you

01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:39,790
have for worry but no the worrying is as

01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:42,880
effective as trying to fix a bug by

01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:45,100
chewing bubblegum the real troubles in

01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:48,370
your project are up to be things that

01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:51,160
never crossed your worried mind the kind

01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:55,660
that blindside you at 4pm on some idle

01:19:51,160 --> 01:20:02,110
Tuesday do one thing everyday that you

01:19:55,660 --> 01:20:04,050
didn't think of work document don't be

01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:06,970
reckless with other people's patches

01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:12,160
don't put up with people grow a reckless

01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:14,580
with yours code don't waste your time on

01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:18,010
jealousy sometimes you're ahead

01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:20,620
sometimes you're behind the race is long

01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:24,520
and in the end you have all the features

01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:27,970
you can handle remember the compliments

01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:31,470
you receive forget the insults if you

01:20:27,970 --> 01:20:31,470
succeed in doing this tell me how

01:20:31,599 --> 01:20:40,639
keep your old design docs throw away

01:20:34,939 --> 01:20:42,289
your old flame wars test don't feel

01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:44,659
guilty if you don't know what you want

01:20:42,289 --> 01:20:47,030
to do with your code the most

01:20:44,659 --> 01:20:49,099
interesting projects I know didn't know

01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:51,169
in 99 what they wanted to do about the

01:20:49,099 --> 01:20:52,820
millennium bug some of the most

01:20:51,169 --> 01:20:59,030
interesting projects I know is still

01:20:52,820 --> 01:21:00,919
don't get plenty of peer review be kind

01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:05,389
to your wrists you'll miss them when

01:21:00,919 --> 01:21:08,360
they're gone maybe you'll release maybe

01:21:05,389 --> 01:21:11,800
you won't maybe you'll be four maybe you

01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:14,059
won't maybe you'll be obsolete by 2015

01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:18,050
maybe you'll be powering the White House

01:21:14,059 --> 01:21:20,659
in 2050 to whatever you do don't

01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:23,479
congratulate yourself too much or berate

01:21:20,659 --> 01:21:27,380
yourself either your choices are half

01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:30,399
chance so are everybody else's enjoy

01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:32,929
your community use it every way you can

01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:35,059
don't be afraid of it or what other

01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:39,800
people think of it it's the greatest

01:21:35,059 --> 01:21:41,479
assets you'll ever have communicate even

01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:45,050
if it's only with the two other people

01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:47,889
who care about your code keep the readme

01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:52,010
up to date even if no one ever reads it

01:21:47,889 --> 01:21:57,229
do not read IT magazines they will only

01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:59,510
make you feel angry get to know your

01:21:57,229 --> 01:22:01,689
fellow communities you never know what

01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:05,179
they'll be contributing to your project

01:22:01,689 --> 01:22:07,489
be nice to your fellow contributors they

01:22:05,179 --> 01:22:09,199
are the best link to your path and the

01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:10,790
people most likely to stick with you in

01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:13,260
the future

01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:15,420
understand that committers come and go

01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:19,050
but for the precious to you you should

01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:21,300
hold on work hard to bridge the gaps in

01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:23,580
geography and lifestyle because the

01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:25,620
older you get the more you need the

01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:30,270
people you knew when your code base was

01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:34,110
young where the web framework once but

01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:36,540
quick before it makes you hard write a

01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:42,510
parser once but quit before it makes you

01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:46,590
so travel except certain inalienable

01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:49,860
truth code with at tango managers will

01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:52,230
misunderstand you too will get old and

01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:55,050
when you do you'll fantasize that when

01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:57,660
you were young code was clean managers

01:22:55,050 --> 01:23:05,400
understood tech and your c64 was

01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:08,450
user-friendly respect your peers don't

01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:11,910
expect anyone else to maintain your code

01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:13,610
maybe you have a docs team maybe you

01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:16,980
have some great maintenance programmers

01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:19,650
but you never know when either one will

01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:22,110
get carpal tunnel

01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:24,540
don't mess too much with your website or

01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:29,909
by the time you're out of theta it will

01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:33,600
look like geocities be careful whose

01:23:29,909 --> 01:23:36,780
advice you buy a good patient with those

01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:39,960
who supply it advice as a form of

01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:42,050
nostalgia dispensing it is a way of

01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:46,140
fishing the past from the bucket

01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:48,989
wiping it off putting interfaces over

01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:52,560
the ugly parts and recycling it for more

01:23:48,989 --> 01:23:55,280
than it's worth but trust me on the

01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,280
