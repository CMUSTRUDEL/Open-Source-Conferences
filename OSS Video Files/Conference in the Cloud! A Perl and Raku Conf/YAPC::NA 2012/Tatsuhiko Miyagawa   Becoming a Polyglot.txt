00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,160
my talk this is this is a new topic that

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,710
we're going to give at the conferences

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,750
and I'm going to do the stock at

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,869
different conferences in Japan later

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:29,519
this year this is one of the first a

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:31,710
chance to do this so hello I just put a

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,410
lot a lot of London stuff to the stock

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,550
in it I think it's not as structures

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,920
that it should be but bill with me and I

00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,300
it we appreciate it if we give me a

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,510
discussion questions if he backs in and

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,480
after this talk on email Twitter IRC

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:52,579
whatever I just in face-to-face this is

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,800
my first you know try on this topic so

00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,469
well just a little bit about me um just

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,660
in case you know don't know about me I'm

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,979
miyagawa you can just call me I got

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,049
people just wonder why i use my last

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,720
name is my money and everything but this

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,930
is a japanese thing people do not call

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,640
each other be the first name except you

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,340
have a really common name like tanaka

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,840
suzuki and thanks but so anyway you can

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,369
if you're coming from Pearl I'm not

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,130
really offended if you call me by my

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:26,430
last name so that's okay I have a lot of

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:30,060
stuff when posed in Sipan live in San

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:33,140
Francisco summer I moved from Japan to

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,579
some san francisco six years ago i think

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,869
and i got green car last year so we

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:41,400
video for a while I think the area the

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,729
neighborhood I live in in itself South

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:50,009
of Market on its close to a lot of

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:52,020
startups like a github Twitter and the

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,210
Airbnb and those companies if we use

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,009
Ruby a lot and Python as well so that's

00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,299
that's one of the reason that I have

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:04,729
been doing exploring different languages

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:07,649
other than Pro to make make the

00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:11,310
searching for my job a little easier and

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,830
more you know more choices basically and

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,750
I late this year I changed my job

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,960
to and started working for this company

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:22,290
called cookpot cuckoo pad com it's one

00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,670
of the biggest railed shop in Japan and

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,610
I think it's one of the biggest in the

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:32,250
world to in terms of the user base they

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:36,420
got a millions of users and it's it's

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,880
surprising that almost like half of the

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,520
women in 30s in Japan uses this site

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,320
every day to decide what to cook and

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,060
share what they have cooked with the

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,950
pictures and then give the peapacks to

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,690
each other and it's really surprising

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:54,959
and I the cook pad is all built on rails

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,570
it started as a cold fusion site like 13

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,280
years ago but i think it's like six or

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,680
seven years agopages reload everything

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,959
from scratch and then run a top of Group

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
rails at that time with Rick one point

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,290
something in the version and then they

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,230
upgraded to latest two and rails three

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,970
it's it's a modern curd and and they

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,100
invest a lot in his open source

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,810
technologies and then they sponsored the

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:24,050
railsconf in hosting in israel and it

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,910
was really fun to attend these

00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:29,489
conferences then it cook pad actually

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,130
paid my flight and hotel for to attend

00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:35,970
easy ops ii as well and then you know it

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:38,519
will sponsor Upsy Asia in Tokyo this is

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:41,010
logo in there so it's a good company I

00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,530
like them so these were my co-workers in

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,180
Tokyo I because I'm the only employee in

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,430
the u.s. right now but I walked with

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,650
them remotely and actually last week I

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,880
just went to Tokyo with a last-minute

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,700
business trip to work with this

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,900
viewpoint it's great so today I'm going

00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:01,800
to talk about a polyglot think polyglot

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:05,010
is a ejecta volunteer I describe a

00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:08,459
person who speaks nose uses several

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,350
languages and obviously obviously in a

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:14,820
programming context it's a person to

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:18,690
describe who uses different languages

00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:21,109
like Perl Python Ruby JavaScript all

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,109
those things

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:28,159
and even before has changed my job

00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:30,710
average this year before that I was

00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:33,620
working at say six opossei and awkward

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,780
and all this company is actually not the

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,000
one hundred percent pro shop anymore and

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,289
they use Python a lot of st. media and

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,650
the dough cloud is almost one hundred

00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:46,759
percent Python shop and I joined a lot

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:49,849
too by doing these different languages

00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,979
and a lot a lot of things and by the way

00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:55,610
if you put like this is my LinkedIn

00:04:51,979 --> 00:05:01,340
summary profile like I do pearl Ruby

00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:03,259
Python and note if you put these kinds

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:08,419
of profile on linkedin you get a lot of

00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:11,810
recruiter emails and I usually I just

00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:13,870
ignore those liquid emails but one of

00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,819
them i got like last week was really

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,199
interesting it's like I wanted to ask

00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:20,659
what is the purple thing than your

00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,610
LinkedIn picture so it's like I almost

00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:24,380
attempted to leap fly this because it's

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,419
like something that I usually asked at

00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,240
the ops ii conference or Twitter people

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:32,029
just always ask me about this anyway

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,729
this is a personal touchy email well

00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:37,729
done well it just in case if we wonder

00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:42,919
what it is this is what it is it doesn't

00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:44,509
explain what it is but this is yeah it

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:47,840
has a question mark in it so it's

00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:51,009
mysterious thing but this is a chimp

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:55,099
chimp yo where is trust now you can use

00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:57,860
anyway today I'm going to talk about

00:05:55,099 --> 00:06:00,349
well things are laundry fun interesting

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,840
not interesting using Ruby Python it's

00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:05,330
kind of random things and how I stole

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,400
these great ideas into my pearl recent

00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:11,029
projects in a couple previous couple

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,729
years and lastly I can throw you some

00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:16,669
some some ideas that you can you can

00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:20,840
take to apply free apply to your

00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:22,699
projects so I start using Ruby almost

00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,979
like half an ear girl when I change my

00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:28,460
job and I my impression with that the

00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:32,120
language is really good it's a quite

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:34,810
enjoyable language and I like a lot did

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,880
some of the things that I can

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:42,020
obviously everything is object which is

00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,520
makes the things much easier than

00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,900
dealing with the differences with the

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,150
functions and built-ins and things and I

00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:52,340
you know by the look of it Ruby look

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,220
more like looks more like Python but I

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,960
actually when you do the actual

00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,870
programming with Ruby in a couple weeks

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,550
I found it i find it ruby is more

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:09,080
similar to prole than Python the reason

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:13,760
for that is the culture of Ruby embraces

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:16,130
diversity the encourages more than one

00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,500
way to do it kind of motor which is

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:22,430
diversity models that the mats talks

00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,720
about and a lot of conferences and get a

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,580
thing that I like about it's the meta

00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,270
programming is built in so if you're

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:31,310
into moose a mop kind of thing ruby has

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,490
everything is built-in and its really

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,410
pressured to deal with it python twice

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:39,800
to hide these metaprogramming things

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,720
from you too to not do crazy things

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,760
without that kind of frustrated

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,190
frustrating me when I was doing a Python

00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,380
job and there's only one way to do two

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,860
things and then it helps you always do

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:54,740
in then some things to to make make your

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,590
code you know friendly to to the sort of

00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,210
machine rather than the opposite so that

00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,820
was kind of frosting but in Ruby this is

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:06,139
the culture that encourages doing crazy

00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:08,030
things and I like it and also that the

00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:10,340
things I like with rupees the use of a

00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,320
band ? there's a tiny thing but it can

00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:16,449
you can use the bank and the question

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:19,159
mark in the has a method of prospects so

00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:23,060
usually you use the question mark is to

00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:26,659
indicate that's a boolean method and you

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:30,800
can usually just use in Perl you can say

00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:33,409
like you have a box class and then like

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,180
is underscore empty method but usually

00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,669
in Ruby you can omit that is on the

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:41,630
school a bit and you can just say empty

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:44,540
? and this makes me so that way you can

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,760
we use the same term to indicate the

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,360
normal method destructive method with

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,810
the bank

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:54,040
and they brilliant method with the ? so

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:57,230
that helps a lot I mean you right okay

00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:01,130
and well some small things that I like

00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:03,019
about as well you can omit self this

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,820
computer sometimes because everything is

00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:11,630
read I namak when you when you look at

00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:13,910
the look at the variable well I can take

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,649
a letter you can tell you cannot tell if

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,709
it's a method of our local bar I will

00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:21,440
Aunt Alice until until its run time so

00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:24,190
it's kind of it's kind of a big dynamic

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,500
stuff and it sometimes computers as well

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,940
often it's really useful to we need to

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,529
do refactoring and everything is

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:35,089
crashing you can if statement returns

00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:39,529
expression the last statement and switch

00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:41,630
statement to and you can omit return if

00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:43,399
its last sentence of the method all

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:47,149
those things which is not possible this

00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:50,890
Python again so it's a lot of things

00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:54,050
that I like about so this is the pythons

00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:56,089
zendo python is a pep 20 a pep is a

00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,779
python enhancement proposal is a

00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:03,050
repository of proposal to change Python

00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:05,959
it a lot of proposals somewhat which

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:08,570
accept that some will not not accept it

00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:12,110
and this is the one of the earlier

00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:14,990
earliest proposal this is the guideline

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:17,029
to write a good Python programs and then

00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,920
it's a good document but there's some of

00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:24,079
the some of those things that I don't

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:25,910
agree with like um you know in explicit

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,470
is better than any place it is this is

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,800
one of the blood thing that Python

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:34,070
infosys VT like you cannot you cannot

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,380
put you know variable assignment and if

00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,699
if state if condition in one place or

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,380
something that some other things

00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:41,540
restriction that I'm really frustrated

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,709
with and Ruby doesn't have that

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:49,310
restriction anyway this is what a simple

00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:51,410
pearl object-oriented code looks like

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,600
without using loose anything at all this

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,160
is really simple one you define a

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,250
package of the class with the package

00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:02,910
statement with the new method and

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,590
define access or to it and define Park

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,330
method with the dog class with the buck

00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:10,350
method it with the name attribute that's

00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:12,060
the three simple stuff and this is what

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,600
it looks like in pearl in it this is

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:18,000
what it looks like in Python um it's

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:23,070
it's arguably much shorter than the

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,930
integral and you see a lot of underscore

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:29,190
underscore stuff in Python code because

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:32,310
I found everything is object in Python

00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:35,420
tier but instead of having a bunch of

00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:38,580
methods in and a core object classes um

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,350
hi son encourages you to define special

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,910
methods like Anna squander school in it

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,090
underscore underscore count and a scone

00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,770
and score get to work with the built-ins

00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,370
I think it's kind of interesting but

00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:52,910
sometimes it's got little it all knowing

00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,990
and this is what it looks like in Ruby

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:59,220
one of the difference is that Ruby

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,680
basically uses the two space indent

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,300
rather than for Python doesn't actually

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,400
care about it but as long as you're

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,440
consistent if you mix in a full space in

00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,170
the two spaces it was just you are you

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,420
in a desert compile it is sometimes so

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:15,000
frustrating but can I understandable i

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:18,330
like i like the two spaces i am almost

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,310
tempted to convert all of my pro okay to

00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:23,190
use two spaces in then or false face who

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:26,730
uses to space in there okay in Perl

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:28,620
right okay well I always thought a mix

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,820
peering about it but these days I've

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:36,089
been a little interesting anyway Ruby

00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:39,030
uses the outside but not enough to to

00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:41,550
represent array it is to you present

00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:44,700
attribute the scopes this is an instance

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:47,370
variable if we use a double up Mac it's

00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:54,210
the class instance cross sorry cross

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:57,420
cross variable and you know this chop

00:12:54,210 --> 00:13:00,600
shop with the hash with the bracket it's

00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:03,930
a string interpolation inside the these

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,760
are quotes and this one uses a name but

00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:08,300
there is no name variable in the Deaf

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,070
bark block right but which this means

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,050
yourself is omitted so it calls the name

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,390
method which is defined as a thoroughly

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:18,240
so utterly is like a Moose's you know

00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:20,220
read-only access earthing so this one

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,110
this dog class is name attribute with

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,720
the out sign in it into initializer and

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,510
then after reader defines the read-only

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,120
access to it and then the buck mr.

00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,160
references into the name so it's

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,800
sometimes it confuses you a little bit

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,700
because what is this valley boy is not

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,930
defined in here you can just go into the

00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,640
inheritance tree to find the right

00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:45,269
military to the super classes and things

00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,220
so you know sometimes it can be

00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:49,589
confusing but most of the time I find it

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,990
really you know pleasure to use much

00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:53,490
shorter code easy to refactor because

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,529
you can you can use it as a variable

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,500
first and then extract it as a method

00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:01,740
you don't need to change anything at all

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:04,050
so I kind of like it and the one thing i

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,630
like about ruby is the module it's a

00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:09,329
kind of mix n is the bill it's a

00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:12,899
built-in feature to the language this

00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:15,750
one is a screaming mix n so it changes

00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:19,829
the bulk method to make it all uppercase

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:22,350
instead of a mixed case and it's one so

00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:25,230
the usual way to use module is to define

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,730
a new class that in here is the existing

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:30,029
class or just a new class or whatever

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:33,120
and then include the mix in to you know

00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:34,890
mixed that features into the class that

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,110
way we create a new class script

00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:40,020
screaming back which inherits from the

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:43,410
doc but as in the back method from the

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,810
screaming module and then so so this one

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:48,209
if you call the buck method on it you

00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:51,240
will get the get the ball watch on in

00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:54,779
all uppercase but it can also what you

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,940
can do is to just mix in into the object

00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,709
instead of a class so you don't need to

00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,230
define a new class at all you get a

00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:04,649
create new instance of a dark and then

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:08,160
call extent on it not include extend is

00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:11,310
to call an instance on it and so add in

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:15,930
those mixing into the object rather than

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:17,310
a specific class it all those these

00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,760
kinds of meta programming it's much

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:24,899
easier to do in ruby than Indian program

00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,720
Python in my opinion it's really

00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,230
pressured

00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,829
to do and is it some example to probably

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:35,259
bang methods and question method all the

00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:37,240
built-in methods for example this is a

00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:39,399
string manipulation methods like up case

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,430
this is a change turn it turn the

00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,500
strings into upper case if you did not

00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,720
use the bank returns returns the

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,649
uppercase value but doesn't change the

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:54,459
original by but if you call a bang on it

00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:59,529
it changes the original value inside

00:15:54,459 --> 00:16:01,209
object and rails people use this Bank

00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:03,879
method in a little different way than

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:06,490
the Rubies core language they have like

00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:09,339
they indicate the bank message to

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:13,689
provide a dangerous version of this

00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:15,459
method or a version of the missile

00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:17,970
Destro's exception instead of returning

00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:20,199
nail on the failure so for example

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,420
octave record is like a cross CBI

00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:25,420
Olivia's class kind of like a floral

00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:28,389
mapper and it has a safe method and by

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:31,600
default it returns nail on failure but

00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:34,809
if you call save bank it will throw an

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,740
exception on a failure it's a it's a

00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:41,290
interesting you know convention is

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,879
accepted adapted by community it's not

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:47,350
it's not embraced by the language itself

00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:49,540
but you know these kinds of conventions

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,509
has been been built around the community

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:56,139
and I think it's really interesting

00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:58,360
anyway so I think I thought what I found

00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:03,220
fascinating in Ruby ecosystem unit

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:05,530
community is that they are to me to my

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:08,230
eyes they try to embrace changes a lot

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,659
they break things a lot and like for

00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,760
example in ruby ruby on rails from two

00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:14,799
to three to three to four in other wow

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,679
there's a lot of changes to breaking

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,230
changes so it's really hard to keep keep

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,059
keep up with it that's why they come up

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,640
with my stuff like bundler witch which

00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:27,250
I'm inspired by church to write cotton

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,990
to freeze the Persians instead of

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,419
keeping up to 2 the latest version of

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:35,919
rubygems every week they can freeze the

00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:39,730
version and they can wait as long as

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:45,429
they as they support it before upgrading

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:47,980
2 2 the latest version and they so they

00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:50,040
embrace the changes they let someone try

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:53,980
something new and adapt it if it's good

00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:56,950
not to not enough to if it's not good I

00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,210
think that's the that's a culture little

00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,610
cultural difference that from the

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:04,330
community especially a few years ago

00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:06,490
it's like pro not criticizing this is

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,429
not a talk about you know dissing pearl

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,350
and so don't throw it exit me this is

00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:13,720
like introducing different you know

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,490
culture and then just think out of the

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,450
box what would it was the difference or

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:21,460
what can be a fly I I think pearl

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,230
community tend to think improving the

00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:27,610
existing thing except in ones and then

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:30,820
you know not notes doing something from

00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:33,580
scratch and do something over but I

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,350
think I think Ruby people try to do

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,559
something until it different and then

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:42,970
easily switch over if it turns out it to

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,740
be good for example rubygems is like

00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,950
kind of like see Pam but it's actually

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,900
living you it's it's it has become

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:52,510
standard probably like four or five

00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,549
years ago and until then it started a

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:57,580
ruby application archive it's like just

00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:59,919
a link to the towels it was not really

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:03,580
useful and they switched to Ruby Forge

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,500
it's like kind of exhausted repositories

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,660
of the modules that he can install it

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,150
from and then it just came up with the

00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,280
idea to you know single repository

00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:19,110
single you know place to install and

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:22,750
then that much the blow job to install

00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:24,490
the DiMaggio is called gems in Ruby but

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,010
he's kind of assistant it's kind of new

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,960
and they you know try different things

00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:34,960
and then switch to it when it times are

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:38,440
good in rails was originally tune using

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,570
the cgi RB and fastest yeah but they

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,880
merged with the new framework called

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,549
mervyn and they just merged everything

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,120
is squashing two together two rails 3

00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:51,159
and then and they came up with

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,270
interesting things like whammo it's like

00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,830
a llamo thing to represent HTML

00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:58,590
CoffeeScript some of some of you like

00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:01,980
and dislike copy script is a Ruby Python

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:05,820
like language that is compiled to

00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:10,740
JavaScript assassin is CSS it's a it's a

00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:14,220
superclass of CSS to to you know easy

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:16,680
right write CSS these kind of stuff is

00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:20,100
like some the products on Ruby community

00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:22,410
and I like I like that how they try

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,500
these new technologies and then adopt it

00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:29,520
too quick way to to them so the Ruby

00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,140
gems is a website that it looks like

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,670
this and it looks it's kind of good and

00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:40,080
I myself published a little a few gems

00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:45,270
in the past three month and I find it

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:47,940
really easy too easy to do and creating

00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,890
a new gem is just one command bundle jam

00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,410
to create templates it's kind of like H

00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,210
to excess and mojo stutter if you know

00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,280
what it is you just create a really

00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:59,550
simple template that looks like this is

00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:03,600
a tiny phone so we can probably not see

00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:05,820
but it's Ali just like 20 lines of gems

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,030
spec file it's just kind of like me crap

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:11,160
here but it's a it's a ruby file

00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:13,860
obviously and then it integrates well

00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,650
with the get by default so if you're not

00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,120
using it you have to provide change it

00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,850
to something else but if you just use

00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:23,940
get you don't need to do anything

00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:26,520
there's no need to edit manifest file it

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,010
it does this thing automatically for you

00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,590
and then you can dip that the thing that

00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:33,810
I like about it is this is a built-in

00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:37,260
way to specify development dependency

00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:39,180
without screwing the end users and of

00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,910
course power can do it do it with the

00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:45,800
you know the news if amerispec and all

00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:50,220
but it's built into the to the gym spec

00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:53,400
and I like it a lot and signing up the

00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:57,330
Ruby gems to publish my jam to it was

00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:00,060
really painless there's no process to

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,790
apply for it and someone needs to you

00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,170
know approve like like post used to be I

00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,410
don't know what was the what's the

00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:08,800
process it is just

00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:10,690
users but used to be you have to submit

00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,840
what what kind of modules that I want to

00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,730
publish in and someone impose how to

00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,110
click the Update button to to do and

00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:21,120
there's nothing like that and rubygems

00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:24,100
apparently which kinda interesting and

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,980
well bit in a bit of jam and push it is

00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:30,040
just one command as well um I know that

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:34,270
Pearl has a lot of tools like like this

00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:36,100
but I think I think personally I I feel

00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,530
there's a little confusing to new new

00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,210
authors there's a lot of different ways

00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:42,600
to do it you can do more to install you

00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:45,100
can the module bill make make a diesel

00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,190
I'm not saying that the choice is not

00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,990
about to it as a bad thing but I guess

00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:55,710
there should be always a simple way to

00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:59,020
do and especially for new users so

00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:00,910
that's that's my experience with droopy

00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,940
and there's a couple of things that I

00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:07,720
did to to steal from Ruby to my personal

00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:10,530
projects you know this is saying a good

00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,600
artists borrow the great artists tale

00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:15,930
not sure if this is actually what castle

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:20,770
said wikipedia says it's questionable

00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:23,760
well so I have a couple modules on

00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:27,610
Sibanda I completely stall from movie

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,890
one of this web scraper I saw a couple

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:32,230
talks in this conference to talk about

00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,300
web scraper and then some guy just came

00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,550
to me yesterday web scraper is one of

00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:39,150
the best thing in Perl and I appreciate

00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:47,880
it but it's completely inspired by lubys

00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:51,850
scrappy gem it's a it's a ruby dsl

00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:53,980
module / gem to you know define the

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:56,880
scraper when you when you look at the

00:23:53,980 --> 00:24:00,610
curl it's it's almost exactly the same

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,290
with sorry kind of messed up yeah this

00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,900
is this what it looks like in the pearl

00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:09,070
web scraper and then it's entirely the

00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:11,440
same that the reason why that is too I I

00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:13,780
was standing up see agent 2007 and then

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,140
Jesse gave a little interesting talk

00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,929
about you know defining dsl in Perl and

00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,629
I was kind of spa

00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:25,730
by that so what I did was to steal that

00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:27,019
interface API from scrappy so I don't

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,899
need to think about think about it and

00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:33,499
then just run how to do this in Perl

00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:35,149
because doing dsl is so easy in Ruby

00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:37,759
because everything is object and you can

00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:41,470
omit self which means everything every

00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:43,789
you know world in inner code is a method

00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:45,710
which is not a case in probably how to

00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:49,669
bind it a little earlier than that to

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:51,230
say hello hello doing it and because I I

00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:53,749
know how to do is scraping with pearl

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:57,289
with the HTML tree builder libya xml all

00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:59,299
the things so just took the idea learn

00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:02,059
how to do in pearl Marie bit existing

00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:04,490
tools and and in the cobweb scraper and

00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:07,549
it was it was a great hit there's a lot

00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:10,419
of people who like it and who uses it so

00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:12,619
I am I got I think it's a big success

00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:16,369
I've got a little issue with it though

00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:17,840
um one of the issues is a DSL so I

00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:21,440
thought I thought dsl is a great idea

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:24,610
but when you do when you provide only

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,919
the dsl it's difficult to mix with the

00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,720
existing object oriented code if you

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,480
have a scraper classes and you want to

00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,190
define bunch of different classes

00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:37,100
because the dsl is all the functions not

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:39,139
the methods it's a little difficult to

00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:43,519
mix in with the existing code like that

00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:46,549
and because dsl uses the build function

00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:49,009
and then text and hash keys it is really

00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:51,830
easy week two typos when you make typos

00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:53,899
it's a little difficult to handle errors

00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:57,049
in the runtime which another case with

00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:59,419
Ruby so there's some of the lessons

00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:02,450
online for it so it's it's great if you

00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:04,840
can still good API if Ruby Python have a

00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:09,259
library that has a great API just do it

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:12,889
and you have so you know what kind of

00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:15,379
existing tools can be wrapped with it so

00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:18,860
in my case of the HTML tree builder and

00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:20,809
xpath modules and live xml things and

00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,429
then you have to be aware of the

00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:25,639
limitations and differences with the

00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:28,869
languages and and you may have to change

00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:31,760
a little bit if in case is a limitation

00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:35,480
the other example is a PhD

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:40,510
I in a plaque some of you some of you

00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:45,020
might know that there's a existent

00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:47,380
experiment called htp engine it was done

00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:52,100
by a pole and over here on with 2008

00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:54,500
this was a experiment to portcullis

00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,270
engine and available to all the

00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,820
frameworks rather than the number one to

00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:01,220
just call us and it was a great idea but

00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,810
he also tried to borrow the idea with

00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:08,680
rock and diversity I from Ruby and

00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:11,840
Python but they didn't copy the original

00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:15,110
rock and debris she I idea which is I

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:19,550
just say includes remember my big hash

00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:22,580
and then returning just an array to to

00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:24,440
implant the response instead instead I

00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,390
provide a higher level API on top of

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:30,290
that which was a great idea because

00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:32,240
colors engine already does that but that

00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:35,450
was the reason the recipe engine was not

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,690
really adopted by existing frameworks as

00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,400
much was we were expecting so I think I

00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,990
think the dumb I didn't win Brahman hash

00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,740
and return interest an array that was

00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:48,980
the point of the rock and wc guy so I

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:52,070
just did that with the psei which is

00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,470
this is a tabu isha in Python in ruby

00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,750
and pearl it six it's almost exactly the

00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,030
same cut with a little different syntax

00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:03,020
difference but it's the idea is almost

00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:05,840
exactly the same and the documentation I

00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:08,900
took the pythons pip 333 which is the

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,900
wsgi documentation and rock interface

00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:18,530
documentation is just copied it over to

00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:21,140
to pearl so that's now a little

00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:24,170
different little changes to to work with

00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:26,570
pearl but almost entirely in a copy and

00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:30,260
paste so I think it's been a huge

00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:32,560
success of PSG I stuff used to be pearl

00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:35,720
web frameworks and servers you have n

00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:39,470
frameworks and M servers you have to

00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,780
write n times and you know adapters

00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:42,800
between them but right now it's it's

00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,990
just

00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,960
web frameworks just white PhD I and

00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:50,720
after sabras right PhD I after connect

00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,280
them any individual any arbitrary

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,310
combination of those two scan can work

00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:58,550
with each other very well so I think it

00:28:55,310 --> 00:29:00,850
was really a huge success so there's one

00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:05,080
one issue that i have with the with the

00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:08,420
copy stuff um this is a rock

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:11,720
specification it was like that the lines

00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:14,500
must not contain characters veto 037 I

00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,750
just red LED like five seconds when I

00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:22,940
037 or what it is and I thought it was a

00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:25,370
HR of 37 so it was a dismal 37 but it

00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:28,940
was obviously wrong it was he was an

00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:31,940
octet so you have to it's actually 0 37

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:35,750
in Perl tear I was just to you know

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:38,420
thinking not thinking twice to to put it

00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,250
into a parole so it was kind of an

00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:43,160
embarrassing mistake that has been there

00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:44,990
for a year in specification he goes with

00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:49,010
a copy paste failure from from know from

00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:51,230
rock anyway so and the clock clock is

00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:53,420
implementation of the paci with the

00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:56,270
pearl and obviously inspired by the

00:29:53,420 --> 00:30:00,230
rubies rock and a little bit from

00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:01,700
pythons velg silk I don't know it's

00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,940
pronounced it is it I think it's a

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:07,070
German full tulle you know simple things

00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:12,980
like tool can be difficult to pronounce

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:15,260
in German anyway this is what it looks

00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:20,630
like it in rack has the rod rye berries

00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:24,710
um like file cascade common lager I just

00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:29,680
put it over to pluck you know how look

00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:29,680
look like each other pretty well um

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,420
lobster I don't know what it is it's

00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:36,830
like it's a sample app that displays the

00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,779
lobster logo or something like that it's

00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:46,289
it's a it's a stupid app

00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:48,779
yeah I even copied over so yeah it was

00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:51,739
really easy to do and some of them some

00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:55,649
of them is actually lined by a line copy

00:30:51,739 --> 00:30:58,139
some was not because you know one of the

00:30:55,649 --> 00:31:01,649
things that I found difficult was rock

00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:05,009
as you are you're a map you are a map

00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:06,799
that RB it's to mount multiple rock

00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:10,919
application in different different

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:14,789
endpoint path the problem is it uses the

00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:17,899
method called map it's not available to

00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:20,519
toe in in pro so I change it to mount

00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:23,549
but other than that it was three

00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:26,999
straight forward to do and pro and this

00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:32,009
is the bills okay the python has a

00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:33,690
wonderful browser-based debugger so when

00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:36,989
you when you application throws an error

00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:39,149
you get this you know beautiful winter

00:31:36,989 --> 00:31:40,859
page and then I think about it you can

00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:43,619
actually click one of those lines and

00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:45,359
put the interactive Dibakar and you can

00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:47,999
type in the code and to see what the

00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,580
variable look like it was crazy idea and

00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:53,479
I thought I thought this is really great

00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:59,539
so I copied a robot to walk in the clock

00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:59,539
its exact same HTML templates in the CSS

00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:05,399
and JavaScript and but I actually walked

00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:07,859
with the parole you know what it on a

00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:10,229
house did copy the templates and look at

00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:13,200
the code and how to do it it basically

00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:15,570
copy the old electrical environment in a

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,519
global variable and the threats let's

00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:20,339
storage or something like that and then

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,869
using Ajax to send that whatever you

00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:23,820
type in the browser to send it to the

00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:26,129
Ajax and in return the code in the JSON

00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:29,369
I'll return the output in the JSON so I

00:32:26,129 --> 00:32:31,859
put it it and because you know Python

00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:34,109
and Perl don't share the way to to catch

00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:37,919
exceptions and evolved you know Mexico

00:32:34,109 --> 00:32:39,479
code so i did some research and then you

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,969
know you can do it with pearl with a

00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:46,789
ball with a ball with mexicans in duvall

00:32:41,969 --> 00:32:50,279
start start race so the same thing I

00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:53,570
think what I learned from PSG I and vcp

00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:56,900
engine was too don't just worthy

00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:59,840
you probably better copy it instead of

00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:02,900
just you know mix things together on top

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,660
of the thing you can borrow and if you

00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,820
do it if you do copy the interface you

00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,260
can do copy the ecosystem too there's a

00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,980
lot of rock stuff that you can pull

00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:15,080
Roberta Flack and then you know you have

00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,030
to be aware of the difference you know

00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,310
when you've been copying it like like

00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:21,850
embracing mistake that I did but

00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:26,980
otherwise it's it's really easy to do

00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:30,010
and you know in a future I think PhD I

00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:32,780
right now it's a version 1.1 I think

00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:34,640
it's a great specification but as these

00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,490
days i often find some of the problems

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,180
like especially like streaming stuff

00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:43,180
which is kind of gets really complicated

00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:46,370
rock people is walking on a two point O

00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:49,640
rock for the future and then that was

00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:52,340
yeah people do WI to point out I think I

00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,960
think I can wait a little bit and what

00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:59,090
they're gonna do with it and then I can

00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,990
steal it you know it's just kind of

00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,820
interesting because you know

00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,910
cross-language pollination this is the

00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:07,910
whole top about this topic this is

00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:12,230
single clock it's a funny name common

00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:15,410
lisp you know rock double she I and I

00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:18,790
saw i saw the presentation in some most

00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:18,790
of the code reported from pros be

00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:27,629
this is really interesting and I was

00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:33,929
applied to rock this is a ruby mailing

00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:36,480
list and they cite my my blog volcano

00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:38,279
typepad com Hey look at the wood look at

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,319
the what pro people do when can we do

00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:45,000
this in Ruby and they say this is what

00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:47,010
what's going to happen even when you do

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,929
something like the publish stuff on the

00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:51,210
github and then this is really

00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:54,029
interesting so you can see more examples

00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:56,700
like that really has a ruby version

00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:58,589
manager Ruby I can install a bunch of

00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:01,170
different Ruby's you may notice that

00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:03,750
it's it was pulling over to probe with

00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:07,619
the probe root which inspired a PHP brio

00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:10,440
there's also Python brio it's a great

00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:13,170
idea that's you know inspired the

00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,450
language to each other we very

00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,460
interestingly and python has a bathroom

00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,950
amp it's kind of like a local lip that

00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,410
you can create a local virtual

00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:24,690
environment for the Python dependencies

00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:27,299
and run times and went to buy

00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:31,109
ex-coworker markup ask create a local am

00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:33,390
its its its uses local lip internally

00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:35,579
but uses a budget and like you know face

00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:39,390
so taking taking the great interface

00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:42,720
Murray but you know integrate it with

00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:44,849
the existing pro tool to to get that get

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,769
the new stuff out I like I like this

00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:52,170
kind of stuff well you can see a lot of

00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:55,259
pearl inspired stuff and other languages

00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:59,069
too especially in Ruby you know

00:35:55,259 --> 00:36:00,869
mechanize it's a ruby ruby gem it is

00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:04,200
mechanized it is acknowledgement that is

00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:07,829
heavily inspired by by pearl mechanized

00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:11,970
and a Lester and if we go to Ruby gems

00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:14,549
and you find a most downloaded gem on

00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,680
the site I wanted once it on to any way

00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:18,630
but that's a what's locked in a second

00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,880
and mime types you might know what it is

00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:24,480
it's a copy of the power of mime types

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:28,049
to Ruby you know what is why is popular

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,509
is that rails depend on this internally

00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:32,339
so it's not this this module is

00:36:30,509 --> 00:36:33,509
particularly popular but because just

00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:37,439
ala factor with rails

00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:40,169
depending on it anyway so I have some

00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:42,749
ideas to do accelerate some poor nations

00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:44,939
like this I think you have to you have

00:36:42,749 --> 00:36:47,299
to publish your code on github um yes

00:36:44,939 --> 00:36:50,880
whoo it doesn't need to be get out but

00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:53,339
right now the de facto place to put it

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,459
put anyone to find your use of the code

00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:59,729
is a get up I mean obviously see panic

00:36:56,459 --> 00:37:03,779
pearl but github is a closed language

00:36:59,729 --> 00:37:06,959
committee repository and write a killer

00:37:03,779 --> 00:37:09,299
app so for example I wrote this thing

00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:11,429
called github growler it glows the

00:37:09,299 --> 00:37:13,469
github updates with a Mac os10

00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:15,779
application it's written in perl but i

00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:18,199
packaged into a DA top file so that he

00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:21,509
can just double-click and install it was

00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:25,409
a feature in a github blog post and so

00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:27,179
it has like 200 Watchers on my you know

00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:29,369
project and some some of the people who

00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:31,529
don't know actually in Perl contributed

00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:34,639
you know documentation pictures and some

00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:39,869
some pics simplechess it's kind of great

00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:44,569
Gator example is relax I Mike orcas or

00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:47,219
Ruby programmers but they use a clot so

00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:51,719
write a killer app with pearl and two

00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:54,149
more exposure thanks okay i'm almost

00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:57,019
running out of time but lastly i'm gonna

00:37:54,149 --> 00:38:00,719
talk a little bit about the naming stuff

00:37:57,019 --> 00:38:03,869
it's kind of a controversial I know so

00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:07,139
pro tent to name stuff is a really

00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:09,199
descriptive htp several simple so yeah

00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:13,049
basically simple HTTP server interface

00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:17,699
JSON access jason module return excess I

00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:19,259
guess net worth like maybe that's

00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:21,679
because they didn't also taken and it's

00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:25,619
not light so they come up with the light

00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:29,880
and this is how you name it with pro

00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:32,880
modules and python is not creative

00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,400
either they basically take some nouns

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,820
and other pie to it

00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:44,040
like I lost two pies your IP PMO numpy

00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:48,370
and this is what it looks like in Ruby

00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:52,440
yeah Joel psych unicorn thin rainbows to

00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:55,630
a keeper paperclip factory girl capybara

00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,490
you might know what it is so it's it's

00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:00,780
chaotic and it's confusing at first but

00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:05,620
i can tell i can i can tell all of these

00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:07,720
six sorry twelves gems i can tell what

00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:11,050
it is and many Ruby engineers

00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:13,900
programmers to as well so I think pearl

00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:19,570
is descriptive a little boring I'm sorry

00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:21,220
and often comes up with a chaotic stuff

00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:24,570
because Jason access Jason like Jason

00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:29,140
simple cheat on fast see you soon doing

00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:31,890
JSON any blah blah blah and the python

00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:34,930
has the same problem to think and Ruby

00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:36,670
people seem like come up with the fancy

00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:40,870
and creative names but it's kind of

00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:42,880
confusing at first but all the time it's

00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:46,660
easy to figure out whatever it is it's

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:49,450
more personal it's more you know little

00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:51,610
traffic I think so well but that's

00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:54,520
except remux anyway because pearl people

00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:57,370
and pie some people use fancy names for

00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:00,610
web frameworks anyway khalistan sir

00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:04,030
Majora's you know python to the jungle

00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:07,870
bottle as well so i don't know why it's

00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:10,540
it's only in the web frameworks someone

00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:14,610
can tell me but people i think people

00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:16,720
tend to love software with names I think

00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:19,630
well the wayside is you need it but

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,120
these are the things that I and you know

00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:26,170
some of you have come up with latest

00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:29,410
lately sign on starlight Twiggy Pinto

00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:31,660
cartoon next slide I think these names

00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:36,100
kind of stand out and people tend to

00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:39,240
like a soft wet with names this is

00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:42,610
actually what MST told me in my private

00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,650
Narcy now I got people trying to deploy

00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,180
symanova procedure because time and

00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,810
having a name makes it seem more real

00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:52,190
than plug Kandra if she

00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:53,660
if it make it makes him sigh so I know I

00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:56,900
know what it feels what it feels like

00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,790
and then I'm not not least jesting every

00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,370
module should take it stop by my name is

00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:03,230
face instead of like this 51 very simple

00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:05,750
like business logic modules data

00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:08,180
conversion modules take take a whatever

00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:11,180
this is descriptive that that's okay but

00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:13,880
um if you read application or little you

00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:18,710
know unique stuff let's just give your

00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:22,640
name um I think it's a good thing so

00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:25,160
lastly right all the time so this some

00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,410
some of the ideas like and SWAT you you

00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:31,940
can steal these ideas do whatever with

00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:35,570
it what I think I'm waiting for word to

00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:39,590
happen the pro is a asset packaging you

00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:42,400
know there's like 100 web application

00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:45,980
frameworks on Sipan and if you want to

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,560
have javascript file CSS files mini

00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:51,970
files in one file to deploy every

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,530
frameworks as one of these plugins and

00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:58,270
also the bender assets like if you want

00:41:54,530 --> 00:42:00,710
to use jQuery Twitter bootstrap you know

00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:04,670
lots of lots of good javascript CSS

00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:06,770
frameworks on and install it in on to

00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:08,890
your project on your parole project you

00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:11,300
have to copy you have to persian it

00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:14,320
whatever you pizza better was a simple

00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:18,950
Marshall so these stuff asset pipeline

00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:20,690
and sprockets is a web server the sub 0

00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,220
/ 2 over the Batman and the production

00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,200
you can just minify it's a won't file

00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:27,380
and put it on a production to survey

00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:33,110
from static web server I hope that's

00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:36,230
going to happen a pro and tilt tilt is a

00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:38,690
ruby template engine but it's not an

00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:42,350
engineer oh it's an interface so ruby

00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:44,600
has i don't know 10 12 template engines

00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:46,910
like like for all it's the same template

00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,950
toolkit x-lite HTML template you have

00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:50,780
bunch of template engines it's the same

00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:53,750
with ruby but they have a common

00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:56,060
interface so you can you can use and i

00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:58,730
use file extensions to work with it so

00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,730
you have you can have food aerobie to

00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:03,130
use the EOB template food

00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:06,100
hamel to use the helmet in play this is

00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:08,380
a convention so I think it's going to be

00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:12,370
awesome to have this kind of thing in

00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:16,870
Perl frameworks to took a hero means

00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:19,450
working on Tiffany it's a product tilt

00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:22,330
two purl one end it's not it's not we

00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:24,250
accept Larry well yet but I think this

00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:26,470
just because it's not well known yet as

00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,060
well so I think I think there's going to

00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:32,250
be taking over a little bit little bit

00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:35,860
further and you see that when you go to

00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:38,530
github and see a discreet read me up

00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:41,440
these modules you see like build status

00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:43,690
failing dependency up to date this is an

00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:48,220
image in hot link image in the readme

00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:50,440
file to this thing called Travis CI it's

00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:53,410
a continuous integration for github

00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,240
projects it's kind of like sea pen

00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:56,980
testers you know but see pen testers you

00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,170
have to publish the code to see Pam and

00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,120
then you will receive the you know

00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:03,880
failure in a success which is good which

00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,590
is great but probably see I you can do

00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,170
it with on the github you push the code

00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:10,840
you instantly receive the notification

00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:13,300
so before making the lease you will

00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:15,810
notice like lack of dependencies the

00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:20,950
typos you know all those things and

00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:22,390
actually actually Duke Leto contributed

00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:25,630
the prole start to throb you see I who

00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:30,070
is available but I don't think it's well

00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:33,010
known yet so you should try this I'm

00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:36,580
going to see more things like this used

00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:38,740
in Pro projects the other thing is

00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:42,490
called Jim nacim I don't know what it is

00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:45,220
how to call it but so this is an

00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:47,680
interesting project your projects has a

00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:50,050
gem file is a list of the gems and then

00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,900
you pass publish to give up and this

00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:56,470
site you know collects these gem file

00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:58,870
and analyzes it and show you which

00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:00,810
module each gems you use in which team

00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:03,160
is a doubt update it and notify

00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:05,650
notifications you notification if it if

00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,720
it's outdated it's kind of it's kind of

00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:10,599
like sipping taps

00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:15,480
service but it's it's more like a animal

00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:19,660
social and walks will get up and bundler

00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:21,580
it's a Freed's and managed application

00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,599
dependencies I'm trying to copy a robot

00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:32,130
to Pearl with the sipping fire on cotton

00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:34,599
and capybara it's a it's a web scripting

00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:36,510
testing framework now you can use a

00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:39,250
mechanized back and rock back and

00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:44,410
selenium back-end you use the just a

00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:48,760
simple dsl to test your rock application

00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:50,950
rails applications now application one

00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,040
of my friends Misaki created a brownie

00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:55,300
it support of capybara to pearl it

00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:58,390
obviously uses a double-double me

00:45:55,300 --> 00:46:00,280
recognize in a PhD I interface so take

00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:02,530
the take the idea from Ruby and Murray

00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,630
with the pro technologies and it's I

00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:07,119
don't think it's on Sipan yet but it's

00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:09,550
it's doing a good progress on it so I

00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:13,570
hope it's going to be hit c-band soon

00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:15,580
and you can try with it um well I'm

00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:19,000
setting it run out of time so there's a

00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:22,630
lot of stuff that a mac applications to

00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,119
make it easy to develop on a mac ruby

00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:28,780
has a different virtual machines

00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:32,380
runtimes JRuby JVM and Rubinius it's a

00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:35,770
ruby in Ruby and iOS development with

00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:40,180
Ruby motion those things Pearl has only

00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:44,619
one run time right now what profile yes

00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:47,770
I was six I multiple which is good at

00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:52,930
aquarium is once again working on a new

00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:55,359
/ 05 ish ish language keturah it's not a

00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:57,820
profile exactly that you can embed

00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,800
profile at runtime in it so you can use

00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:02,320
Sipan modules on this language which is

00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:05,560
kind of cool well I mean that same as

00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:11,470
pro 6 does but a different different you

00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:14,650
know angle so you can go out explore us

00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:17,589
to do be in Python steal great ideas and

00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:20,740
AP is not just borrow you can copy as

00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:23,430
much educate and

00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:30,850
take it and marry with the Polish stuff

00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:32,860
and so deal with it um I think I think

00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:34,830
this Ruby people Python people is it not

00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:38,020
enemies I think their neighbors um

00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:40,930
there's a lot of committee stuff like

00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:43,780
Yadav has a lot of drink up since major

00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:47,380
cities in in US and also in the world as

00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:51,550
well go to these meetings the conference

00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:54,670
is like OS bridge Oh STC get friends

00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:56,910
with these people you know what I would

00:47:54,670 --> 00:48:02,200
I did with the oxy agent six years ago

00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:04,900
in Tokyo the keynote speakers were very

00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:07,600

at the ops ii Asia the first UFC Asia

00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:18,250
and he was given a talk about Ruby and

00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:20,800
prose it was it was really interesting

00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:23,800

embedded takahashi style you know this

00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:54,340
is a his reader of Tokyo Ruby users

00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,710
group and he came to the conference and

00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:58,690
gave a talk as well so this is you know

00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:03,640
Matt's is nice to be nice this Ruby's

00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:06,000
moto Andy Andy came up with the least

00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,410
