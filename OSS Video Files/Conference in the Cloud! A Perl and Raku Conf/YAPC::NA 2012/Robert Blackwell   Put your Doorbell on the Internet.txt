you

00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:00,949
all right Wow so all of you who signed

00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,830
up to let me hear you're coming thanks a

00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:06,930
lot of you signed up I missed it just

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:13,020
two minutes ago a lot more views than I

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:14,700
expected but that's awesome no no we're

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,799
gonna go sign up there's just thing you

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,429
know after uh oh I think I'm going this

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,899
talk and electrical stuff done visit our

00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:25,380
this talk is definitely the thing that

00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:28,500
you should not do it was a life which is

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,630
a life in any more than that i'm going

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,110
to probably the kind of migrated here to

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:38,909
actually see some of what's going on you

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:40,799
might have to do a kind of stuff but i

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,350
started to put this talk together and

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,880
show you slides and be all like oh look

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,470
if you get this call this day what

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,709
happened and here's the screenshot and

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:54,239
it was just all getting really stupid so

00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:56,550
half of you are already my friends the

00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,810
other half probably should be and you

00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,800
know hopefully we can all make this work

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,569
and everybody can you have a nice

00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:05,729
experience so i am robert blackwell I

00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:07,619
lied to you a little bit this talk is it

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,160
just about you're putting your doorbell

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:14,459
on the Internet I'm a big fan of small

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,890
things loosely coupled as I'm sure most

00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,209
of you are so I'm hoping that you will

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,379
see all the little building blocks of

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,239
how you produce some really cool stuff

00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:25,050
and you can really over you near the

00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,940
doorbell like a real big should um so

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,650
how many people are already playing

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,810
around in this space and doing something

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,569
with Arduino or other embedded stuff

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,930
yeah Paul yeah all right well that's

00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:39,450
fantastic good like only Paul raised our

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,890
hands pretty much because there's a lot

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,629
of really cool stuff that we can be

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:47,340
doing with this I was really excited

00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:49,019
Sawyer okay and early to yapchi and sat

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,269
down for several hours in the hard rock

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,409
a thong and started from I can't do this

00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:55,409
I've never done that's what are you

00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:58,000
doing this is crazy to doing stuff and

00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:00,820
it's pretty easy

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,290
could I use the library people watching

00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,610
them well the people at home are going

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,740
to really have a tough time because I'm

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,270
going to be over there in a minute and

00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,140
so can you come to Yap see I'm sorry

00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,680
yeah but I'm not going to hold the

00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:19,920
microphone type in Sorry Sorry from bos

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,920
at home come be absent come to a seat

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,200
sorry you can't hear you from home you

00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,660
should have come to yapti I'll do the

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:41,620
best I'll get slides up and try to do

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:43,959
something please I feel bad really bad

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:52,959
for the people watching at home but you

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:54,310
should be here sorry a lot of people

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,050
have been wondering what this wrong guy

00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,670
doing crazy stuff with this Arduino

00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,400
foremost up and run like we know and

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,019
well I never intended to do although

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,600
some interesting conversations with

00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:06,610
Patrick Micheaux and honors don't hold

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,700
your breath but we don't might happen

00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:12,000
but anyway um what I'm really interested

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,170
in is pearl obviously in scripting

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,690
systems for years where the glute eleni

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,820
which we all know that but I want to put

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,430
us in a position to be the glue language

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,750
for things and what that's going to mean

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,990
is we're not to do some interesting

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,880
things and moan about interesting things

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,760
to our Guido's and other embedded

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,200
platforms I take on Arduino which are

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,300
unfamiliar with this face not because

00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,390
it's the only game in town but it is an

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,970
open source game it uses its part of the

00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:43,210
open source hardware consortium which is

00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,340
awesome so if you don't know about that

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,419
that's going on they have a whole

00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,820
conference our open source hardware

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,890
which is expected to be a billion dollar

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,979
market here and not too long it's

00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:56,050
enjoyed awesome but these techniques can

00:04:53,979 --> 00:05:00,010
certainly apply to other areas and I

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:02,120
hope you can apply them even so I want

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,520
perl scripting things I want

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,949
who knows what you know to be on the

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,660
internet so you can get to this is still

00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:10,070
very much an incubation period I don't

00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,360
have all the interns I know you guys

00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,100
don't have all the entries but hopefully

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,630
the collective over time will come up

00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,820
with some cool ideas that people can use

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,620
and they'll be like oh we do this with

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,389
it being something I'll just go to see

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,160
Panem oh look that much already does

00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:24,080
happen what I want and I'll go together

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,440
like we do for everything else and we

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,760
can apply those ideas to our internet

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:34,220
opinions all right so that's it um you

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,440
have a few code things and so forth to

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,000
show you before we get rolling the basic

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,470
setup i have here is I have the basic

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,960
electronics kit that you had when you

00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,639
were a teenager or younger from radio

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,770
shack is kind of a building block to get

00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,870
it started I've got to argentina's both

00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,240
up to up to the little local network

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,460
with a linux server running dancer and

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,930
just my mac being a front end of that

00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:58,490
stuff it's it might be kind of

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,520
intimidating for some I hope not for

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,680
most and believe me with a little help

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,479
and guidance it really is not the art I

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,770
mean it worked five minutes and you were

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,349
blinking stuff in about another 10

00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:13,580
minutes removing servomotors i mean it's

00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:21,560
it's good stuff all right so our do we

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:24,710
know is program in c++ so we can

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,280
insulate ourselves from some of that

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,280
luckily

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,900
so rest we know while not the most

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:46,150
amazing schedule i receive your life

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:49,360
lets us do some really nice stuff like

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,360
rusty stuff

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,430
so hopefully most you guys are we

00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,970
playing with some rest interfaces and

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:06,720
knowing what's going on but for instance

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:13,690
this little service here is holding my

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:16,360
security plans so I i'm using resti

00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:19,870
which basically lets me register the

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:23,229
root of my web service so that it can do

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:25,030
interesting things like get /a 0 which a

00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:28,510
Sierra relates to a physical dress on

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:30,130
the Arduino so I just say this is all

00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:32,830
stuff you pretty much know while true

00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:36,130
due date yet that's kind of weird to

00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,720
slash v08 and then just sleep but it

00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:41,350
will read the value and i will move this

00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,760
to the extreme one direction and you'll

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,919
see that it's a thousand 23 and I'll

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:48,460
move it can be extremely other way and

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:52,900
up and go to the link is lucky oh thank

00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:55,449
you alright so thick they saving um so

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,520
and it's 250 back case on which is

00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:01,800
pretty handy and we have tools it turns

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,780
out to read JSON so that's that's a

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,510
that's a good thing so the sketch that's

00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,039
running online the Arduino the recipe

00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,690
note is untouched by me i just checked

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,169
it out a good hub and put it right on

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,490
there it is if i'm using it and i'm

00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:21,810
getting utility out of it and that's

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,810
awesome alright so

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,530
and I don't know if people want to come

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:33,580
on come around yet or not but i can say

00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:36,919
get pin 9 and i can say that it's hot

00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:40,789
well that's all fine and dandy but i

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:43,430
want to turn it on so i say and what you

00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:46,220
can't see is hard to see but a little

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:48,260
light came on on this day which

00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,690
definitely the proxy for your doorbell

00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,840
or it could be the proxy for something

00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,550
to unlock a door or who knows what and

00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,430
they can also then you come up and go

00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,280
hey you know what no I need number 8 to

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,350
be on tues and bam I've got two LEDs on

00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,910
and if I want to get their statuses

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:09,430
because this is kind of a restful

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,430
interface why did that one go

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:48,630
because it's a live demo you should

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:48,630
never be but certainly watching now okay

00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:58,840
so now that there's one on the second

00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:06,090
went on and I get nervous in front of

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:06,090
all my friends Oh second well it's going

00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:27,910
anyway they're coming they're coming on

00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:34,300
alright so but that's talking directly

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:35,680
to the Arduino great so that's all fine

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:42,910
and dandy but I really certainly would

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:49,060
not want to expose on Arduino to the

00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:52,230
outside world alone I would want to

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,230
again put something

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:12,250
alright so in the doorbell example so i

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,250
have this setup where

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:31,330
I was good so he's verified check it out

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,800
work yeah you press the button the light

00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,170
comes on for a moment and it goes off

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,330
and the simplest thing that possible

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:43,410
that works for this is this is a little

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:43,410
dancer up thanks all your others is this

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,940
so those for you those of you not

00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:51,430
familiar with dancer I hope we're still

00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,680
able to follow along rather well but I

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,240
have a doorbell route that has a framer

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,130
of occasion because I have a front door

00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:02,709
and a back door and each have a doorbell

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:06,430
so the simplest thing that will possibly

00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:09,160
work not production joke but so I set

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:12,550
ten nine because that's the one that we

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,930
have our doorbell on and we raise it on

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,910
we sleep for a second because you don't

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,430
want to keep it raining and we bring it

00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,350
low again and just um both the status

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:25,390
from right and we just use gub-gub have

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:28,300
met to call over an Ambu to get to and

00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,890
as you can see that was working yeah and

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,440
the interesting thing so this is an

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:35,620
Arduino acting as a client and another

00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,329
one I think is a server so you know it

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:42,940
is certainly over engineers and have to

00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:44,260
Arduino but yeah once you have lots of

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,459
little pieces glued together the

00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,029
doorbell just becomes a part of the

00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:50,430
system as well so that's kind of fun

00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:54,060
anyway

00:12:50,430 --> 00:13:06,870
and can even press the buttons you like

00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:10,620
and it comes on I so it can garlic on

00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:15,620
come on be on TV press the button what

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,620
is right on the art Lena thank you yes

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:29,260
well now with Arduino land you get to

00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:30,910
set your mac addresses how a lot of

00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,399
changes happened with the 10 release

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:36,300
which I think it does gns better now and

00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:39,100
some other stuff conjecture do DHCP and

00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,510
if the other things I haven't they just

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:45,760
released it not long ago and haven't had

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:47,230
a chance to rock all the detainees then

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,450
you the Ethernet shield do better with

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,800
the mac address i believe but before you

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,329
always have to set your own mac address

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,970
which is really racking up to and you

00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:57,790
forget to change and bloody heck is

00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,019
going on you know change the IP number

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,230
that's in your brain but changing the

00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:03,339
mac you ever changing their back so you

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:09,000
want to make sure that you have to make

00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:14,910
max mac addresses not mac computers for

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:18,430
failing there are enormously great

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:21,399
examples on the Arduino website and in

00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:26,320
their sketch examples and this is just

00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:29,320
kind of stolen from that to do some

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,700
setup for these two functions on arduino

00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,370
that you worry about their setup and

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,839
this loop so the setup is going to say

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,450
things like the pin we're going to work

00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:40,420
with is going to be an input in contrast

00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:42,550
with an output in we're going to do some

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,950
cereal volume so we're going to set the

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:49,120
serial speeds we can above what's going

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:52,779
on in the console we're going to get

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,410
hurt using the connection will delay

00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:59,260
give it some text connect and then

00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:01,510
code and then we're going to loop

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,800
forever reading the button stink and if

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,620
the buttons hit goes high we're just

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:10,240
going to call for Bell and they record

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:13,300
everything the big big big exciting bit

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,529
of code is down here in dorval which

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:21,010
just says to connect to the server and

00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:23,680
blast for 3,000 and laugh doorbell front

00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,690
door because I just made a hard-coated

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,730
but in theory you have each one test

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,500
which can oh this is the front door if

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,269
this is the back door call board met

00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,579
with front call doorbell was back and

00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:35,829
you can have different actions doing

00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:39,370
whatever you want I mean whatever you

00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:42,880
want text me do you know do all kinds of

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:45,850
crazy stuff which is is to me it's

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,500
really it's not that much here let me

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,480
despite some weird stuff that makes me I

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,120
wasn't trying to show it but it's really

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:55,720
not that crazy and it's pretty

00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,610
accessible for us off hoping i get some

00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,600
other people right

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:07,149
fun stuff so you can press it in other

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:09,850
people compresses so basically what

00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:11,709
that's doing is it's going through this

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:16,750
one going out and coming back to this

00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:18,700
word in front of neckline I just find it

00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,829
be incredibly cool and we can do more

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,690
stuff if you want to turn the knob you

00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:25,050
can actually see that it will change the

00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,050
bottom

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,720
anybody any kind of questions will

00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,050
actually come up and see some of this

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,540
more was kind of expecting to have a

00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:48,390
little more interaction now anyone but

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:53,430
Mike there's actually two so our Drita's

00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:55,650
are a minor controlling platform where

00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,990
we stack on top our Ethernet shields

00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,700
shields our expansion boards there's a

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:03,540
really cool website called shield list

00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,740
that will it tries to bring all the

00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,810
shield's together but you know it's

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,230
there and the kind of painful part is

00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:13,080
once you start to stack shields you have

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,589
to be careful because felton some shield

00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:18,839
eat pens as they move up the stack

00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:21,510
depending on what they're doing so you

00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:23,730
know maybe one needs to iop so it steals

00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:26,430
digital one in digital too and then oh

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,110
but so does this guy's swirl well it's

00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,850
not Jimmy a problem because they're

00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,200
constants and you can go in and change

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,210
them but we just need to know that

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:38,640
you're starting a bunch of shields up

00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:40,380
we'll take some well go for a long way

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,890
for separate room there's always finals

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,890
um you know but it's

00:17:49,090 --> 00:18:10,210
the community is doing a nice job right

00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:18,010
on the bottom here then on top of that

00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:19,840
are the key to help college the source

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:24,580
is the extension work a fancy name for

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,110
expansion top and if you got to look

00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,779
forward that you want to do to stack

00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:30,279
that on top but obviously is you you

00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:32,230
need to have communication going between

00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,520
the Ethernet shield in the Arduino

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,820
before so it's going to be simply

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,529
fantasy sci lecture so and that's what a

00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,950
website called shield list does a really

00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:45,520
nice job illustrating how what pins are

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:47,640
going to use this thing so anything that

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,970
show there's an example

00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,220
y su there's wireless shields there's

00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,440
all kinds of you there's even a drink

00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:58,140
shield which you know we in the pearl

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,170
communications absolutely use because we

00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,390
should tie it to your blood alcohol

00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:06,060
level and find out what everyone

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:10,650
appropriate optimal ballmer peak is and

00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:13,230
not let you commit this until all of our

00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,750
biggest purposes since we have secant

00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,160
esters you know we can kind of work

00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:22,410
through and figure out what that is p

00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:24,960
little boots care yeah please talk okay

00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,850
so if you could for the two or three

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,750
people who don't know who Paul is he was

00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:38,940
also really geeky into this stuff to

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:40,530
wait yeah okay just a very quick chantal

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,410
for those people who haven't seen it

00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:46,020
very very small large windows this is a

00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:50,280
Leo stick and it's pretty much the size

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:52,320
of a USB thumb stick and it pretty much

00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,840
works the same way plug it directly into

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,080
your USB port and if you're running

00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,610
Linux it will then crash the tunnel so

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,990
there's actually work around for that

00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,940
but I very very first got one of these

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,320
it's an experimental wall these are an

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,360
experimental board that work em down at

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,500
the news conference in Australia this

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:13,450
year at LCL one commercial give them

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,830
three drives which is a

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,110
in tape on commercial since then but

00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,150
simply the prototypes working around and

00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:22,010
they're fantastic is a ralphs USB power

00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,810
you can program things in you can stick

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:26,120
it right in the compatible with the

00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,350
books eyes are green oaks and for those

00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,670
of you who have seen pictures of your

00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,910
mind I've actually got this sort of

00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:34,160
steampunk outfit and the fixative glove

00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,500
with electronics and control options of

00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,750
everything there's one of these inside

00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,730
that control box and so all the Maya

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,590
dials and switches everything going to

00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:45,230
hear which then control the lights under

00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:47,630
going on and all I'm doing there is I'm

00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:49,400
again with fireballs power each board

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,140
rather than having it being powered by

00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,120
do is be so they're very very cool down

00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,580
to come a bunch of light on them there's

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,530
Google piezoelectric speaker on the back

00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:01,070
so you can have them for tunes and sound

00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:03,290
and everything and I've even spell these

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,670
manacles box enter so you can figure out

00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,830
whether you bought something right

00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:08,900
really the piezoelectric drugs and right

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:11,480
into them and you've got all or I can

00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,730
talk about them and see how they seem

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,360
whack it against the table or something

00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:20,150
that was something doesn't break so

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:22,970
quite small and very very cool supports

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:25,490
an evident this is called a Leo stick um

00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:28,070
I believe there is a natural there's a

00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:30,590
design for the Arduino hold the quickly

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:33,560
an island we have a similar yet this is

00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:37,970
effectively the backstory visit we

00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:39,680
recording this I don't know my

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:42,530
understanding of the recording of

00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:44,720
understanding of the Baxter entities is

00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:48,290
it's very quick people saw pictures of

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,480
the Leonardo boards and said oh I think

00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:53,530
that we can reverse

00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,650
those and we came up with this and and

00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,750
it does actually work with the world so

00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:05,470
these are rather small as you get and

00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:07,090
they've washable cleanups they cover the

00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:11,049
whole accessory get so you can actually

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:13,240
get both company called sparkfun 284

00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:15,490
sell these types of things maker shed

00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,880
from o'reilly is another through several

00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:23,980
others those big three they do a great

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:26,020
job of sourcing stuff forth there's you

00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,490
know serving the move in the current

00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,590
electronics is to move everything to

00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:32,169
surface mount and put them in black

00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,970
boxes of hard work to use and what

00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:36,640
companies like sparkling and Adafruit

00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:39,070
are doing they are going through and

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,080
meant to be accessible to everyone with

00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,660
breakout boards and tutorials and

00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,070
examples and it's really exciting stuff

00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:48,990
lady eight is the one who put the kinect

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:53,220
down to app to open source a driver for

00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:55,090
connector that came out of here but

00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,429
would you thumb with the lily pad

00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:02,169
there's no self conducted theoretical

00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:05,020
still LEDs go sell little buzzers that

00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:07,240
are all what you know washable like some

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,830
level I mean you know we are talking

00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,809
about electronics here but it is really

00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,040
cool I mean I've seen people one of the

00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:15,340
kind of cooler projects I thought that

00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,140
was wearable but sighs calls um but it

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:22,840
was when technical thing was an inbox

00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:26,740
zero pin so so um that had basically how

00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,480
many messages are in their inbox listed

00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,070
and when they were not have been back 0

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,740
and i think that the prohibition simple

00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,929
going somehow and then we not come on

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,320
which was really kind of cool pretty

00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:37,320
seen that one

00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:06,220
colors yeah not really our unit project

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,710
other ones I also are the soft circuits

00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:12,010
where people use conductive yarn and

00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:14,470
conductive thread you make cars and play

00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:17,310
bass board several buttons that iPods or

00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:17,310
whatever they're into

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Oh

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:32,660
the other is doing and to the right

00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:35,990
hahaha so for the pro world in English

00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:38,480
we're shipping about domestically us are

00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:43,250
expecting about a billion a billion

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,480
serial ports to ship rs-232 not USD in

00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,800
the next three years so that's an

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,230
enormous amount of things that we could

00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:51,620
talk to I wouldn't suspect and blue

00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:53,210
together some of you might have heard my

00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,490
example of when I was doing some

00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:58,040
hardware testing I you scripted a power

00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,590
supply sidewalk it was so markedly easy

00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,530
project wrists and hit a button have it

00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,900
open a relay which powered down the

00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:09,920
device i was testing waited five seconds

00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:14,150
and it brought it back up that was kind

00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:16,410
of handy nicole coming in this nike

00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:20,920
welcome the crisis utopia

00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:22,300
so are you doing so Capri tronics the

00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,650
palace on about yourselves a lot to

00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,930
knock off stuff I can't do the exact

00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,610
pricing so if it's a little cheaper but

00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:31,870
our drina's which these are the main

00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:34,210
brain guard wieners and i'm using i can

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:36,340
dip from source from sparkfun which is

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:41,520
usually where are those from for about

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:44,230
30 bucks apiece the real crappy part is

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,490
the Ethernet shield right now is about

00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:50,200
40 bucks and let's face it if it doesn't

00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:54,930
get on the internet and doesn't speak

00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:57,010
JSON then it doesn't exist so that I

00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,990
mean seventy bucks still have a lot of

00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:03,280
money but it is a little fortune there

00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:05,830
are seals out there that are integrating

00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,410
the tube shields together into one board

00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:11,460
hop time one of the hackathon he's using

00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:16,030
four bits time of ebay on ntp server

00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:23,860
with an arduino and a gps receiver for

00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:27,370
his video so but Ross we prolly about

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:29,230
fifty dollars i guess yes something that

00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,930
work yeah but that's a full invited

00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:35,260
really cooking which is cool man has a

00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:36,580
lot more capabilities at some level but

00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,720
doesn't quite have the accessibility

00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:43,420
item so in that case i could see some

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,160
really cool and i hope to have enough

00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,670
identify i was in a second round before

00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,350
we didn't get here it's going to be a

00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,760
steeple some oh yeah you could

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:55,420
definitely have a raspberry potty

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,160
talking to on arduino so you can get 40

00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,680
bucks of these in its true you could get

00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,240
a raspberry pi instead and keep talking

00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,250
that way absolutely the other thing

00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,500
people are doing

00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,690
they're using old linksys routers st

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,910
history comment or any other kind of

00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,410
like a 10 to 11 b router which it turns

00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:13,050
out many of them if you crack them open

00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:16,710
had cereal inside they just never pull

00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:18,450
it out and so you just go in sorry wash

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,690
together and now you have stereo and you

00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:24,210
run it out to your arduino and now that

00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:28,770
access and you're running a little linux

00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:33,690
to share their on on the router so quite

00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:35,730
like the record high but but although

00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:38,970
welcoming fairly low voltage duck so

00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:40,860
that's cool and pretty jaco the hindi

00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,270
aruna sir they're pretty resistant to

00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,990
you doing bad things to them as well

00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:52,380
which is nice because i'd certainly my

00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:54,450
old eyes like talking right then so um

00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,600
whose ethical products they will talk

00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,600
about

00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:09,990
oh this is a great servant so there's

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:15,210
Google um I oh and was it back to iOS

00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:17,670
ago well they did it about but I know

00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:22,110
some things have happened but a google

00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:28,820
i/o I think it was two years ago they

00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:31,650
released the Android Arduino defconn so

00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:34,500
i'll put to that point argument old I'm

00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:38,190
followed about 350,000 minutes in the

00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:41,790
years before in the months after they

00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,380
sold hundreds about the penis so civil

00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:46,130
power of google there but now that in

00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:52,980
all three thousand us radio shacks

00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:54,510
stocks they talk internet shield they

00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,620
generally have are doing or who knows

00:29:54,510 --> 00:30:01,410
they have megan's and they have a few

00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:05,400
other fields right back here which is

00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:07,230
all wrinkly to enjoy something which is

00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,730
you know kind of wine evangelizing

00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,890
yourself immunity because it's becoming

00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,530
popular in the way I kind of see it is

00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:15,410
if we go where are you loaded up CJ we

00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:18,180
love the community up with ideas and

00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:20,970
stuff that's gonna be a good thing if

00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:23,070
people have two great ways same thing I

00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:29,690
want to do and it's like a few secane

00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:29,690
modules away in a dream to reality stuff

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:44,780
but for one example I was just talking

00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:47,360
to Mike Shelia's you need words yeah

00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,340
like he it was mentioning that whichever

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,549
multimeter you made a module for that is

00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,660
up on cpanel but you know we were kind

00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:55,309
of spit balling her i was at least

00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,860
spitting ball in his way is you know if

00:30:55,309 --> 00:31:01,820
we had you know I don't know device

00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:03,710
multimeter that would then you know have

00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,450
a higher abstraction of what you do with

00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:07,880
a multimeter and of course you know if

00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:09,500
we class it correctly then some

00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,419
multimeters have more functions another

00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,280
but there's a base amount of teachers

00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:15,500
that a multimeter has hey what's the

00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:19,309
voltage that's on my meter pretty basic

00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:22,040
and they all speak cereal so you know it

00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:24,799
would be rather easy for us to have a

00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,809
catalog of you know a bunch of

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,429
multimeters which is something a very

00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:30,440
common thing in a lab to read

00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:33,260
multimeters and logged them and find out

00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,760
what's going on it you know from there

00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,650
it's not too far from building a really

00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,179
cool dancer app that could aggregate a

00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,919
whole bunch of multimeters for you in a

00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:41,630
lab and see what they're all doing and

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,120
then bill I want to know in any event

00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:45,380
system that fires off certain events if

00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,000
there's certain amount to drift between

00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,429
the different multimeters and all

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:57,710
anglers like it becomes really cool I me

00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:59,090
of where week ago I saw a hand yes well

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,830
unfortunately I took it apart to bring

00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:05,830
part of the parts here but generally

00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:05,830
speaking it is yeah

00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:20,940
yes there's a little more here oh no

00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:24,129
that good good and this is why I'm here

00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,860
so okay so the Arduino board itself is

00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:29,200
just this board under here that little

00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:34,960
thing and I have a case that fits over

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:37,360
this and it sits in my basement and what

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,919
the current system does before I you

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,649
about rest we know and stuff like that

00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:44,739
but what the current system does is you

00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:48,309
hit the button technologies the doorbell

00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:54,129
this there it calls to my sponsor like

00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:57,009
owed account which just as a very simple

00:32:54,129 --> 00:32:59,710
stupid you know Cindy an email using the

00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:02,739
SMS to email gateway so i'm not i'm not

00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:04,269
sending directly to mail from my arduino

00:33:02,739 --> 00:33:06,850
which are libraries you can actually do

00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:08,619
that but you know what i'm really

00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,149
marched it is bringing all this kind of

00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:12,460
stuff together and almost treating is

00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:15,820
all these devices and all these machines

00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:18,190
is one thing you know not oh this is

00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:20,649
this bunch of stuff it's the computer

00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:22,330
and it's got a you know monitor keyboard

00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:24,129
connected to it that's one thing you

00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:28,600
know over here this is another thing no

00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:30,340
they're all we are doing is to my code

00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:38,769
is microcontroller which is basically

00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:40,299
computer just regular network out no did

00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:43,480
you miss the part where I said come off

00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:45,369
of it this is this is much a kind of get

00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,169
you know actually a good question too

00:33:45,369 --> 00:33:50,259
immature never do about do you have

00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:52,920
cables it run down to your basement so I

00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:55,030
do have big people that one

00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,340
because i already had a previously

00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:59,530
existing doorbell so I just so I just

00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,570
went down to the basement into a

00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:04,270
reasonable spot and spliced into the

00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:06,190
doorbell cable and then I hope there's a

00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:08,500
relay also actually connect to do this

00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:13,210
so the existing Bell still continues to

00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:15,040
work oh yes or not it needs some

00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:17,080
features though it need some features

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,060
like I'm taking a nap to leave me alone

00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,670
don't let the bells ring in this time

00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:28,720
you can do that you said you can easily

00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:35,140
do that I mean maybe we just can

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:37,390
configure the sleep schedule no thanks

00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:41,500
and using jus saw a ton of class in ohio

00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:44,230
linux fast that was I thought people but

00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,790
we use the rest we know to control a

00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:49,390
servo motor and if you're not going to

00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:53,560
put a servomotor it's one of these but

00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:57,190
they come in many shapes and sizes and I

00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:59,500
have a witness it takes about 15 minutes

00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:01,270
to use the sketch and wire it up on an

00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,870
Arduino to use their sample application

00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:07,360
to start moving this and so you could

00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:09,790
take and what the example sketches to

00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,920
give you is using a potentiometer so the

00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:14,380
thing I've had thrown by that you were

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,820
nice enough to change the value of so as

00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:20,320
you would change the value here which

00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:25,660
this is scaled from zero to a thousand

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:27,850
23 these new in degrees from zero to 179

00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:31,960
well there's a really cool function top

00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:33,460
map but it's not a map um it's a map

00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,200
that takes a range of numbers over

00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:37,540
another range of numbers and basically

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,920
makes the experience equal and figures

00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:43,870
out how close they need to be in the

00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:46,870
middle so it becomes really easy so

00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:50,680
anyway I removed the potentiometer from

00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:53,750
that and invest we know and use jQuery

00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:56,000
Mobile with slider if you haven't used

00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:58,280
a date for mobile it's 10 query on

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,160
steroids for mobile devices but I was

00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,490
then able to go and just run the slider

00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,380
like this and tell the motor where to go

00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:09,080
from anywhere that has Wi-Fi on the

00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:13,400
internet and etc and I'm sorry that just

00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:15,260
really cool and it took from the time

00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,270
that conceptualized it to actually make

00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:22,450
you can happen at least in the church

00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:24,560
state was about it i work at you know i

00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,940
just find out to be pretty darn

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,280
incredible and you can do that kind of

00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,670
stuff so quickly and i'm not an EV I did

00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,890
not mean McGee yeah but I mean this

00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,980
stuff is pretty accessible you know um

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:39,920
I'm excited in on an excited evangelist

00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:41,000
that's the kind of de I guess I am they

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,830
don't know that's what I are gonna drink

00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,010
badly but not everything a little house

00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:50,510
I was right so one of the cool project I

00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:53,570
saw is a God set up open CD and he

00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:56,450
looked for the train coming and when the

00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:58,220
train came he had a linear actuator

00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:01,850
close to winter will do his house

00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:06,190
because the train is so bad anyone who

00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:06,190
trained gives away it opens the window I

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:13,120
mean it's very accessible stuff yes

00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:24,029
yes I would love to replace someone say

00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:28,079
yeah so I need some way of generating my

00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:31,910
arm so yep okay so um thank you because

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,910
I did not mean to fly in to talk

00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:55,310
why write what others have done better

00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:58,600
than I could do so especially since you

00:37:55,310 --> 00:38:04,670
know lady ages like you know MIT dr. Lou

00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:06,620
woman this is this is what has been put

00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:11,090
together and it unfortunate kind of fell

00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:14,000
through but you can use the Arduino her

00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:18,340
example that she goes into his green for

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,450
a camera to take pictures using it but

00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:23,030
it's a few dollars for bottling the

00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:24,980
components the trick is you have to you

00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:28,070
know read she goes through this on how

00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,960
you read the signals to know what your

00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:32,330
remotes are currently doing so you

00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,660
capture that and then we have the

00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:42,080
translators send them back out in my

00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:44,420
home you know I have an ir repeater so i

00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,680
put all of my junk in the closet with

00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:48,110
the little receiver out if you've seen

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:52,250
photos right under my TV cuz my wife

00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:55,000
hates to see all the wires it sucks so

00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,990
she gets to see different wire um but

00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,300
it's actually cool too because then you

00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:02,710
can hide everything and if you're using

00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:07,190
a phone you get I'm probably even more

00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:11,210
so anyway her sketch is it's not trivial

00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:17,350
I mean but it's still it's doable and it

00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:17,350
swelled up thanks Chuck

00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:23,920
then you can google to find out what the

00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:26,010
existing remote ascending so you don't

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,010
necessarily

00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:36,350
yeah yeah some of the standard stuff is

00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:36,350
already pre well done and there's

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,280
there's a company called right I

00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,490
actually heard of having tried from the

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,730
ppw one year but they didn't understand

00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:50,640
why that would make sense for them but

00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:54,690
they make a device that is a little bit

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,580
o'clock and it can rebroadcast infrared

00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:59,370
and then they have a remote control that

00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,750
works over Wi-Fi or through some apps

00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:03,420
they're like how awesome would that be

00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:06,930
to have a pearl interface to the red eye

00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:08,130
thing that hey you already know all this

00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,720
stuff and you've already got the nice

00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,280
gooey and you already understand all the

00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,880
codes you have to code database already

00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,440
I don't have to teach me anything it

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,230
took you in your box it's not completely

00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:26,310
cheap but it's you know reasonable it's

00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:29,880
reasonable so yeah you gotta are you

00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:31,830
gonna ding so you won't show it go

00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,060
introduce yourself and show it off so

00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,160
we've been having the hardware hackathon

00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:37,890
maybe soldering Owen a party hat earlier

00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,940
today I got together three Mary to make

00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,940
shields a choice

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:51,670
so hard over the better and you got it

00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:55,900
work you today basically probably

00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:59,680
excited Apache okay yeah ping is an

00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:02,430
ultrasonic distance sensor so two

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,430
centimeters

00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:17,230
1.2 inch people stick with basically

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,230
anyone how closer

00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,779
there

00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:46,109
but very simple basics i'm using this is

00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:48,769
the basis for making something that

00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:48,769
stop

00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:37,420
right to the wall oh so what other

00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:40,290
questions that I want all you guys to be

00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,760
able to proudly wear the hardware hacker

00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:44,380
either you're going to be one or you

00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:52,930
feel like you're already are one we have

00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:55,530
a badge come on it's exciting except

00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:55,530
it's so accessible

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:45,460
especially with this kind of said the

00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:47,799
wireless there are the rather expensive

00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:50,079
I wish I could do the exact price but

00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:53,020
they're definitely there but it might be

00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,490
more cost-effective not too easy well it

00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:57,490
depends appears the minute of your use

00:43:54,490 --> 00:44:00,099
case what's really funny is you get into

00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:01,869
discussions with hardcore electrical

00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:03,730
engineer people what you go but you can

00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:05,319
do all that with a four dollar chip that

00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:08,559
does the thing with the stuff and you're

00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:13,089
like yeah but we got it going in three

00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:15,160
minutes and you're talking a delta of

00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:16,839
twenty-five dollars I mean I just don't

00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,809
I mean if I was making a production run

00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:21,880
of something we can start to entertain

00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:23,319
that okay that's not quite right but if

00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,510
it's this little projects around the

00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:27,510
house the bougie

00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:37,360
and whose I have to pick you up actually

00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:40,420
with me mark where they have pigtails

00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:47,890
that let you do the car over here yes

00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:50,680
I'm actually I'm vice so yeah so you're

00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:55,690
running them both home that may be unit

00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:58,120
yeah so let's check out there now you

00:44:55,690 --> 00:45:00,490
know it sound like if you kind of dream

00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,110
it there's probably a CPD module that

00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:04,840
goes close what you want a bunch of this

00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:06,760
dude walking there but it's the kind of

00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:10,000
thing straight in our dreams that you

00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,280
can dream it she's probably a hack for

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,920
all of you or special she goes I'm going

00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:20,500
to sitting pretty good pretty skilled

00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:22,030
kind of quiet I mean it still not hit

00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:30,610
the critical mass I mean obviously balls

00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:33,390
loose a little bit so what's the big

00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:33,390
deal yeah

00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:49,160
I I do have a talk and then so I have a

00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:51,680
repo I fell pearl hardware but y'all

00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:53,120
show some notes about this discussion

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,620
and I've got some previous talks on

00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,760
Paula Cole will let you put notes up and

00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:58,490
make them in a blog post or something

00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,820
but I was giving an example of how do

00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:04,720
you take the LED blink sketch the very

00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:08,120
basic sketch from the Arduino library of

00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:10,340
documentation we make it blink I gave

00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:13,910
three examples I chose one using your

00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:16,520
standard serial using one over HTTP and

00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:22,700
one using what's called fermanagh which

00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:24,500
is a standard way of making

00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,180
microcontrollers talk basically for the

00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,360
protocol on your microcontroller and

00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,950
then you can run apps that are any free

00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,870
built but know how to speak / modern you

00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,280
just said oh that came to go high in

00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:36,230
just go time and what that thing to go

00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,420
low which I think would be a great way a

00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:40,180
nice danger app we not that we have to

00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,770
modify dancing but I think I'm good nice

00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:45,530
the guy that wrote device for mana visit

00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:48,350
have don't see cameo last look it's just

00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:52,430
out there running wild with these what's

00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:53,960
that but you know hopefully we can get

00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:55,520
you at on see Karen and something to

00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,050
have a nice little thing with we could

00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,130
just want to dance rap and you've got to

00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:00,770
provide an interface into your

00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:03,410
microcontroller with identity knows you

00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:07,910
have to download the fermata sketch on

00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:09,080
to your dream and for my links capture

00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:13,190
me I'm just hack together some pretty

00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:15,950
quick stop but I think some thought to

00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:17,670
be given into what is the restroom okay

00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:20,859
maybe Rex we'd all be me answer

00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:22,980
in fact Richard generic name and then

00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:25,990
the same thing can be done for serial

00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:28,119
serial port of call that notice how you

00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:29,920
do most in the stock so they need kind

00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:32,260
of insulated you just found don't that

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,160
they going to your arduino and go off

00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:37,599
back to Berlin and start playing it so

00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,220
that's pretty cool and certainly some

00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,780
things are getting better optimizing as

00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:45,579
we know them in grover high 48 but you

00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:48,760
could begin to play a little sampling

00:47:45,579 --> 00:47:50,410
thing for instance when i'm a

00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,300
modification i think this should be

00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:55,900
doing because what this is doing is

00:47:52,300 --> 00:48:00,160
going and pulling over a speedo asking

00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:02,140
what analog zeros set to what really

00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,510
that probably should be doing is the

00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:07,000
arduino should be blogging what's going

00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:09,069
on and then into time that i haven't

00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,770
asked and i would get an array of values

00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:13,210
back and it would just don't the results

00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:17,470
to me when I asked and then you start

00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:18,250
over but you know but you know you need

00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:20,500
to figure out what's going to be

00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,579
familiar what's expected so you don't

00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,030
have to think so hard when you're in

00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:26,800
your space but it's really excited I've

00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,060
got to wander nice people that are kind

00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,390
of excited about MacGraw comedian

00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:32,530
already you know so whether you're got

00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:35,410
something to contribute or you're

00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:36,880
anxious for us to get CP and full of fun

00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:40,740
stuff that you can start using either

00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,880
way that's great you know hopefully you

00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:48,010
hopefully I'll put some stuff see

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:49,600
painful or if not you'll be using anyone

00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:52,630
else

00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,890
come on none of you raise your hands

00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,900
it's already playing with arduino so I

00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:58,330
know you have questions you can come by

00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,580
the hackathon i'll be there tomorrow as

00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:02,140
well so if you just want to come on and

00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:05,760
see how easy it is to get some sketches

00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:10,360
loaded the ide does a great job

00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:12,460
eventually you will cuss it and i do but

00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,920
i haven't gone and dealt with the mini

00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:16,540
pops up yet but you can actually strip

00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,280
coat all this stuff in your favorite

00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,830
editor and there's make files for it and

00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:23,110
it can push it over and it's all good so

00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:24,490
don't don't be afraid UD you don't have

00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:33,650
to stay here forever but i would

00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:37,940
definitely a body stocking oh my god

00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:40,099
ok smart-arse awesome sparkfun on lady

00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,579
aileas Oh have neat post that come out

00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:45,470
all the time so a couple other things

00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:47,900
you know the wii nunchuk so you gamers

00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:50,809
out there those have great components I

00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:54,410
have breakout board sugars so I have

00:49:50,809 --> 00:49:58,150
those here Polly yeah I know six ago I'd

00:49:54,410 --> 00:50:02,690
like 10 of them here with breakout board

00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:12,170
don't miss a symbol of my pop just

00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:16,010
radiant so it's a breakup yeah i squared

00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:19,099
ski box you just ugly and libraries for

00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:22,910
and off you go view reference that would

00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:26,869
say kind of reference example of this so

00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:30,880
you up you have a nice l bracket you can

00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:33,880
buy out spark by and just let your

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,880
motors

00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:48,930
so the exact same position which is a

00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:54,030
really cool little project and i have

00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:56,010
this breakup absolutely good have you

00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:59,630
stop by the hardware hackers on the rule

00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:59,630
to seize them out with things i brought

00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:16,680
they have like a two hundred volt power

00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:18,599
supply runs the Elwha so lucky in outer

00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:23,030
space needed workers because your

00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:23,030
called laning lame Matthew vector

00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:34,980
marketing smarter way then you make a

00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:37,980
video game cheat so you can take two

00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:40,290
weeks jocks and they've got the board

00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:42,390
set up where it does the locking so walk

00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:44,809
in for your way into watching and

00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:48,210
they're referencing these pictures and

00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:50,460
so you get to go back and play Tetris

00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:54,200
because you've actually video out to a

00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:56,579
display so you can go out to ser people

00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,380
and you can play this thing which is

00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:07,349
really cool it doesn't get all the pins

00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:11,549
oh yes yes one of the projects i have

00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:13,230
that i want to do with the kids is i was

00:52:11,549 --> 00:52:15,450
lucky to go to radioshack

00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:17,820
when it's in your silence it says that

00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:20,510
always have like are you signing games

00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:23,520
now and I want to face it really

00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:26,310
implement timing but break it out and

00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,570
keep the interface clean as possible and

00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:31,380
you should come out with like one wire

00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:33,210
or whatever well but then you could play

00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:35,369
over you play signing over a rest

00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:38,880
interface with someone else and you do

00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:41,880
all kinds of things you sound it's solid

00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,940
sensible and fun though Patrick thing I

00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,650
want to do is that the ZB step is kind

00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:49,890
of kicking my butt crack frankly but

00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:53,760
i'll figure Oh put it on bowling ball

00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:56,930
with old Bruce it's tucking it with an

00:52:53,760 --> 00:53:02,690
accelerometer only hit with azizi shield

00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:07,020
it's not a talk but I'm in trouble but I

00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:09,359
look hey this is perfect this

00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,859
application because I won't stick to be

00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,080
able to kind of free-floating on hand

00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:14,880
and then I put a button on top so what I

00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,830
want to move the works I'd move it this

00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,100
way the accelerometer knows where it

00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:22,140
will and he knows how fast and I want to

00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:24,300
talk to the media being shield to say oh

00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:26,460
it went there with this pack so it's

00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:30,770
moot libre crafted and go this way can

00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:36,720
use a button on top so drop the book so

00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:39,330
nope it's fine so it's only a still

00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:42,470
exceptionally dumb trouble but color

00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:42,470
that's insane

00:53:58,339 --> 00:54:04,710
so I run a Halloween house to her with a

00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:06,960
few my neighbors and my name one of my

00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:08,489
favors used to be on the radio so he

00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,069
goes all of our radio talent Pittsburgh

00:54:08,489 --> 00:54:14,579
so they went through and recorded our

00:54:11,069 --> 00:54:16,349
Halloween house tour stories it turns

00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:18,809
out when you're doing neighborhood tours

00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:20,249
it's a lot easier to find people to lead

00:54:18,809 --> 00:54:22,829
people from out the house and press a

00:54:20,249 --> 00:54:24,599
button it is to find people to leave

00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:26,249
them house to house press abundant cars

00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:28,950
you do not press a button and tell a

00:54:26,249 --> 00:54:31,440
spooky story so we replaced on the

00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:34,980
spooky story but press the button so

00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:38,160
there's a wave shield it's also an mp3

00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:39,420
shield but they were out of stock when I

00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,869
started this projects not to go into

00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:45,450
waves but you just have a wave one

00:54:42,869 --> 00:54:48,539
little wave files but my application is

00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:50,609
just one have a way to file on an SD

00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:52,920
card that's nice sweetie story with the

00:54:50,609 --> 00:54:54,210
mixed in sound effects and your person

00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,089
walks the place with the walmart and

00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:58,619
bought a bunch of wireless doorbells

00:54:56,089 --> 00:55:00,660
ripped off the pi 0 Ragnar in the guard

00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:03,869
we know when the signal goes high amount

00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:07,410
i go oh okay play and it plays the wave

00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:08,849
5 maybe so we're in amps for the day and

00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:14,609
we got him out to the neighborhood and

00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:17,579
jor God's them open now the level i

00:55:14,609 --> 00:55:20,869
haven't gotten to you because it turns

00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:24,210
out there's a little bit i do right

00:55:20,869 --> 00:55:26,700
around then to golf PGW which sucks all

00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:28,529
my time and now i'm doing maker faire

00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:31,859
pitch for i organize that so it sucks

00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:32,359
all that time but i haven't got to the

00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:33,710
point

00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:36,769
what I really want to have happen is

00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:39,440
when you get to specific parts and the

00:55:36,769 --> 00:55:40,759
stories that events could happen I mean

00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,589
for instance one of us where he swaps

00:55:40,759 --> 00:55:45,049
out the light coming on in the balcony

00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:48,099
well the lights you come on without any

00:55:45,049 --> 00:55:51,470
when that happens we cheat now

00:55:48,099 --> 00:55:53,569
neighborhood kids but it but we could

00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:56,089
totally strip that in a way that when

00:55:53,569 --> 00:56:01,279
you get to this going part in the way

00:55:56,089 --> 00:56:07,220
file then turn the light on it's cool

00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:09,079
could you absolutely but i want this

00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:10,819
specific amount of the car set it off

00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:14,749
and i don't want the trouble dry mattoon

00:56:10,819 --> 00:56:16,640
what motion exactly what's in spot I

00:56:14,749 --> 00:56:18,829
don't want the cat setting it off and

00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,640
neighbors are the dangers that are in

00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:38,569
the club they get a little ooh it after

00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:42,650
two days so we can try to limit what's

00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:49,009
that you can leave any time the doors

00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:50,329
enough ah well that's fun too anyway

00:56:49,009 --> 00:56:52,160
thank you guys so much i know this was

00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:54,140
very informal I hope you gained

00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,400
something when you're excited I hope you

00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:58,460
go to stick something really cool to see

00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,380
Dan if you go put it there send it to

00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:01,519
somebody hopefully we'll figure out some

00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:04,160
kind of pearl mailing list or something

00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:05,930
if only they're handing out you know

00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:10,430
only we get a mailing list for this kind

00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:13,299
of stuff or something so maybe they will

00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:13,299
