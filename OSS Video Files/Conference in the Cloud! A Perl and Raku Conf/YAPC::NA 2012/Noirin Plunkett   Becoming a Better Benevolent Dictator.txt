yep so hopefully you're all here for the

00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,969
QA we're going to talk about how to be a

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,580
better benevolent dictator more

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,049
benevolent hopefully unless dictator

00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,029
Paul is going to have a microphone if

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,100
you have questions that you'd like to

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,900
ask in person please speak into the

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,900
microphone so that way they get recorded

00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:53,010
testing are we on that's wrong that's

00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:57,030
when it changes we can find it or

00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:02,039
volunteer you prefer let's let join do

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:04,049
it then okay that's fine we can go

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,670
through the questions we have here we

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,060
can also take questions from this this

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,060
is big dot lee / nation-building if you

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,619
have questions that you don't want to be

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,570
on on the record for and i'm just going

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,700
to mirror my screen so I can see it too

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,700
I can remember how to do that

00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:25,380
efficiently oh well I look behind me and

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,290
what does a bike shed I think we

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,240
answered yesterday a bike shed is a

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,710
project where people feel like they know

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,350
what's going on and therefore want to

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,900
offer an opinion they hope it makes them

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:42,750
sound intelligent and engaged usually it

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:46,920
just ends up in bickering haha that's

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,590
what I wanted presentation view any

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,500
hints for an organization of mostly

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,630
non-geeks our consensus goes smoothly in

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,219
person but terribly on email at least

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,500
one more than about 10 people are

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:02,939
involved I think reminding people that

00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,880
it's still a human being you're dealing

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,200
with on the email is worth doing we have

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,259
this perception that when we're talking

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,930
to a screen it's not really a person

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,260
also most of the people in this room I

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,230
would

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,269
venture guests are not writers we tend

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,849
to talk with our fingers rather than to

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:23,099
write and to compose emails and so

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:25,379
reminding people that they should reread

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,959
what they've written reread it with a

00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,790
critical eye and say how is this going

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,190
to be taken by somebody who doesn't

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,470
necessarily assume that I mean the very

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,690
best when it when we're in person it's

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,220
much easier to pick up on facial

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,650
expressions to pick up on body language

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,879
cues and say of course this person is

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,879
trying to work with me to collaborate

00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,190
we're all going for the same goal when

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,409
you're dealing with people over email

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,389
you lose all of those cues and so it's

00:02:49,409 --> 00:03:00,200
much easier to read a negative tone into

00:02:51,389 --> 00:03:00,200
those emails we've done that one anymore

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:12,900
you have a microphone how do you guys

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,810
deal with social problems like you have

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,099
rules you have moderators all of our

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,560
lists so all of our lists have

00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:22,739
moderators all of our IRC channels have

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,829
ops although anything anyone who turns

00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:28,739
into very controversial an IRC tends to

00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:31,410
go back to email simply because in at

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,730
the Apache foundation we believe that if

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:37,139
it didn't happen on email it didn't

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:39,109
happen largely how we deal with social

00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:42,299
problems is by having a set of norms

00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:45,120
already encoded some of that is written

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:49,410
down although it's very hard to write

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,750
something that is that that covers all

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,660
of the nuances and corners of human

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:58,199
behavior and the Linux chicks rule used

00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:01,220
to be be polite be helpful and that's

00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:04,699
about as specific as you can get without

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,780
ending up in knots and arguments

00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:09,720
occasionally we do have problems at

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,209
Apache where an entire community has

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,280
gotten to the point or a majority of a

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,409
community has gotten to the point where

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,750
they're not enforcing those same social

00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:21,150
norms and in that case it's a matter of

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,210
stepping in typically the board steps in

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,300
at that point and replaces the chair the

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,879
chair doesn't actually have any

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,340
authority but as as social animals we

00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,099
tend to look for authority and create

00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,530
these hierarchies and so shaking that up

00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:40,669
and saying nope hang on stop what we're

00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:44,509
doing let's move forward in a more calm

00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:52,280
more collected more sociable way tends

00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:53,419
to do the job well I've here can I hope

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,550
for a member without dealing with

00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,229
problem people people will continue to

00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,610
cause strife and disruption especially

00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:00,680
if they're strong code contributors

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,409
especially if the drive or others away

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,830
from the project I mentioned in my talk

00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:09,650
yesterday geniuses commodity strong code

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,690
contributors there are so many of them

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,550
you don't need them if they're driving

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,110
people away from your project you're

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:20,270
losing more than you're gaining by

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:22,879
having their code hopefully you can deal

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,319
with the person whether that is helping

00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,419
them to modify their behavior or

00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,520
removing them from the community without

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:31,009
losing their code sometimes you will

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,020
lose their code at Apache we have a rule

00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:35,750
that we only accept voluntary

00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,300
contributions and so if you have donated

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,219
some code to us even if we legally have

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,740
the right to continue using that code if

00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:44,090
you are such a problem person that we

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,250
can't have you in our community anymore

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,830
and you insist on us taking that out

00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,889
we'll take it out we'll tear out

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,990
features and modules or rewrite them

00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:55,940
because we just don't want to have that

00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,370
one person who's driving away tens or

00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,629
hundreds of others it's not worth it how

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,270
do you do that how do you remove that

00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:05,779
person ideally you work with them first

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,520
to modify their behavior and for us that

00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:09,710
typically means a senior member of the

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,340
community working with them one-on-one

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:16,009
mentoring them talking to them it has

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,560
occasionally gone to working with

00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:20,240
people's employers where that person is

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,460
causing a problem both within their

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,750
company and within our communities we

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:28,879
try to deal with people as individuals

00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:30,409
not as employees but work with whoever

00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,289
you can work with whoever that person

00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:36,550
listens to to try and modify their

00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:39,649
behavior parenting books are great

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,550
seriously seriously parenting books you

00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,670
know reward

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:46,100
not punishments you tell them they're

00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:49,130
doing a great job remind them that you

00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,110
know this email was really good here but

00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,820
maybe you should turn it down or take

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,200
out the personal insults or whatever it

00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,790
is and if all else fails remove them

00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,160
take away their commit bit moderate

00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:08,030
their emails to the lists life's too

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:09,680
short how does the Apache foundation

00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,540
structure apply to smaller communities

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,070
seems like it would be difficult to

00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:18,320
implement for projects with fewer than

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:20,030
10 regular contributors and most of our

00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,720
incubator projects i would say come in

00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:25,880
with fewer than 10 contributors i think

00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,920
as long as you have three our rule is

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,020
always the rule of three as long as you

00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,540
have three people you can get out of

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,430
these stalemates of you know two people

00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:39,080
two people can very easily end up in a

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:40,850
me you me you me you tug of war whereas

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,520
when you have three people that triangle

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:47,990
just breaks down that that direct

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:51,110
conflict a little bit um any social

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,760
group has norms three or four people you

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,560
you watch a conversation at this

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,180
conference a lot of them end up being

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,380
three or four people just because of the

00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,570
structure you know the way the chairs

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,760
are laid out and stuff like that those

00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:06,020
groups develop norms immediately we are

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,520
social monkeys and and it's simply a

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,220
matter of saying what do I want these

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,530
norms to be how do i how do i want my

00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,860
community to operate am i willing to

00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:18,410
accept great code from somebody who's

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,790
jerking us all around if you accept that

00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,230
when you're three or four people that's

00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,850
what you'll have when you're 30 or 40

00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,980
people accept that you probably won't

00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:28,630
get to 30 or 40 people because people

00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,630
will be so fed up of dealing with this

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:40,270
just on just on that are with the three

00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:42,120
people a lot of the time at least the

00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:45,970
dynamics i have seen as you often get a

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,640
pair of people who tend to agree

00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:51,550
strongly and work together and then a

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,920
third person it often feels left out or

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:57,130
always in contention how do you handle

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,920
that one of the two has to want to

00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:02,650
handle that one one of the two who have

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,260
power and with all of these things the

00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:08,440
key to the key to implementing change is

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,380
that somebody who has power has to want

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,360
to implement that change unfortunately

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:16,510
these things are much more difficult if

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,380
you're the person who is the underdog if

00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:25,060
you're the newbie whatever it is in that

00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:27,190
case if it's really you know a situation

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,010
where there are a group of people in

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,420
power and they just don't want to change

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,100
sometimes forming your own community is

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,540
the better way to go not necessarily

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,280
when it's 3 people but when it's a

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,770
larger group stepping back and saying

00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:43,240
you know we're actually going to be the

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:44,620
nice pearl people and and forming your

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,830
own group and saying no we're not

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:49,000
playing by those rules anymore

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,250
unfortunately when it's 3 people it has

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,230
to be one of the two one of the player

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,790
has to want to change it and then if one

00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,460
of the pair does want to change it it's

00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,710
a matter of being more inclusive if two

00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,600
people strongly agree you only need to

00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,070
hear one of their opinions if you were

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,420
one of those two people and you

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,820
absolutely agree with what your other

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,100
contributor is saying make it a point to

00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,500
pull in the third person say what do you

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,630
think about this try and pull out the

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,520
relevant bits of their argument because

00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,320
there are for sure relevant bits it's

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:23,670
just that you may not be seeing them

00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:28,360
because of the personality conflicts yep

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:31,900
didn't does the incubator process helped

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,100
break that a problem if you have three

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,010
people who are all thinking together or

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,170
two people in deadlock by and large you

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,120
won't you won't graduate from incubation

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:43,690
at Apache unless you have more than

00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,730
three people but yes social problems of

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,780
all kinds are absolutely a barrier for

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,380
graduation

00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:52,950
and the apache openoffice paddling is

00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:55,630
currently going through incubation and

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,640
although most of the legal side of stuff

00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,830
is wrapped up and there they've made

00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,300
their first puddling release and all of

00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,090
that so the technical side is really

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:05,440
going forward very well that project is

00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,000
not going to graduate to your full

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,900
project until they've sorted out their

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,640
social issues and and again it's dealing

00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,840
with people on an individual basis

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,900
dealing with the community and saying

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,610
you all need to shape up you need to

00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,530
start behaving nicely you need to be

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,600
encouraging new people obviously

00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:25,570
openoffice started with a list as long

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,280
as my arm of initial contributors but

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:31,110
you need to be attracting new people to

00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,110
your community before you can graduate

00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,750
have you lost people because you had to

00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:42,700
discipline problem people or we've lost

00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:45,040
problem people no we haven't lost other

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,980
contributors because of disciplining

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,870
problem people we have very occasionally

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,720
had people who say well if you get rid

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,630
of him I'm going to sometimes those

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,950
people go to and we're very glad of it

00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:00,490
sometimes those people go to and they're

00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,940
back in six weeks we certainly haven't

00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:06,460
lost more than two or three people

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:09,370
because of of getting rid of a problem

00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:12,760
people and like I say usually it's

00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,850
either oh my god or they're back pretty

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,850
soon

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:34,300
so about getting buy-in from the

00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:37,389
existing community first of all if you

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:40,630
have a benevolent dictatorship it's it's

00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:44,110
go to the dictator figure it out with

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:46,300
that person one-on-one and and get their

00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,279
buy-in first before you ever present it

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,980
to the community and how you do that

00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:53,279
well watch horns keynote point out why

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:57,790
you need these things diversity is good

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,649
friendliness is good for diversity to

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,510
get buy-in from a broader community

00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:05,079
where you either don't have a dictator

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,910
or the dictator is with you but doesn't

00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:09,730
want to make a fuss is in that

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:13,690
ninety-five percent of of good but quiet

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:15,910
and same thing really point out point

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,470
out why this is good for us most people

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,970
if you present them with an environment

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,220
where people are being nice and friendly

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,480
to each other will like that better than

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,550
an environment where everybody is

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,709
constantly knocking off each other they

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,690
might not like change and they might

00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:31,959
often we're afraid of change that's a

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,449
natural human reaction but when when you

00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,610
get to the point of having a community

00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:38,110
where more than three or four people are

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,269
saying you know let's let's do this

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,470
nicely let's work together you know

00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:47,050
let's not blame each other all the time

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:49,000
then show them show show them how it

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,649
works and let them see that this does

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,319
not make things fall apart that's part

00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,839
of why i'm here to show you guys hey we

00:13:53,319 --> 00:14:01,230
can do this we have we have 150 projects

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,230
and 4,000 contributors you know it works

00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:10,869
I have enough yeah 1b terminology

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,129
question when you say contributors what

00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:14,739
exactly give me by that you mean

00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:18,249
committers or do you mean an Apache we

00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:22,660
have three I had these numbers written

00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:24,279
down but I think we have 3,200

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,049
committers people who have an actual

00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:30,160
commitment and 4,200 people who have a

00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:33,369
contributor license agreement on file

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,749
with us so it's a subset of all the

00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:36,819
people who contribute but it's the

00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:39,279
people who contribute significantly

00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:41,019
enough that we've decided that this is

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,600
this is a non-trivial patch and

00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:51,069
therefore we've asked for a license

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:54,639
agreement for their work did you have a

00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:55,899
question nope no the gentleman behind

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,319
you I wasn't sure if he was stretching

00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:04,600
her how to question that's okay oh we

00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:05,769
have some work yep to it once I'm just

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,679
going to take one of these while we're

00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:10,209
running around with the mic so ever had

00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,369
have you had project Forks due to poor

00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:15,549
dictators or community rifts has it been

00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:19,839
threatened and managed to my knowledge

00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:24,040
we've had one fork and one situation

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,110
where the entire community left with the

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,360
with the I bodice community the entire

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,889
community decided this is not working

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,779
for us this is not how we want to

00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:33,749
operate part of that was due to our

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:36,329
release policies part of that was just

00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:39,249
miscommunication and misunderstanding

00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:42,160
and so they left and are now a happy

00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:43,540
thriving community on google code on the

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,049
other community that we've had that

00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:51,129
forked due to a problem person was the

00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:53,499
CouchDB project and as far as i know

00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:57,939
that community has not forked the

00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:59,259
original creator of the project without

00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:05,079
wanting to use to emotive language

00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:07,779
stormed off and and is maintaining his

00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:09,699
own Fork independently the project

00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:12,279
community very very quickly said this is

00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:14,289
not us this is not how we want to be we

00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:16,360
are continuing as an Apache community

00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:18,279
you know we're continuing to be a

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,779
friendly and happy community and that's

00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:22,660
how we want to go we want to stay

00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:24,879
here and so there was no problem for us

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:28,800
it was essentially somebody left very

00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:30,579
publicly and and emotive Lee but an

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,339
individual left we have individuals

00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:34,660
leave all the time you know families get

00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:37,779
in the way people have new jobs new

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,629
hobbies whatever happens that's okay our

00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:41,620
communities are designed to survive

00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:46,029
somebody leaving even if they're the

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:49,089
person who originally wrote it I'm

00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:51,009
interested how you guys possibly remove

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:52,149
someone from a community in fear they

00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:54,009
event you know if you've worked with

00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:55,660
them and their problem doesn't yeah if

00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:57,309
it's gotten to the point where we have

00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,050
no choice but to remove this person and

00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:01,480
the first thing you do is you remove

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:03,339
their commitment occasionally we also

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,689
remove their shell account on our

00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:08,709
servers we certainly remove any

00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:10,839
privileges that account has we typically

00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:13,600
will moderate their males so their males

00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:15,880
do not go directly through to our

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,780
mailing lists sometimes what will happen

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:22,209
in that case is males won't be allowed

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:25,360
through to our public lists but will be

00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:27,100
sent on instead to the PMC the project

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,630
management committees private list on me

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:33,429
and so that the PMC can reply to that

00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,320
male and deal with the content of it

00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:38,919
without it turning into a flame war on

00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:41,740
the public lists and I'm by and large

00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:51,549
once they can't shout at us anymore they

00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:52,780
kind of fade out and go away so my

00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:57,130
question actually is unrelated to

00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:59,470
discipline but so my question would be

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,669
if you've got a list of saying you know

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,049
in your project got a list of bugs that

00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:03,370
need to be dealt with a lot of people

00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:05,770
like to deal with the fun stuff and easy

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,179
stuff how do you motivate people to deal

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,299
with the things nobody really wants to

00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:11,799
do one of the things that Apache is that

00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,179
we expect that the core contributors

00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,950
will deal with the things that people

00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:16,960
don't really want to do that's a

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,970
double-edged thing it means that if

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,710
you're dealing with those things you've

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,210
become it's much more easy to become

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,549
seen as one of the core contributors

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:28,539
which comes with with good feeling and

00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:29,890
kudos and kana and and the other things

00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:32,440
that we remind each other that nobody

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,670
wants to be cleaning up after after the

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,200
messy that's nobody wants

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:36,640
do the sewer work very occasionally

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,230
somebody wants to do the sewer work but

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,870
mostly we all want to do the cool stuff

00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,700
but the sewer work has to get done and

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,050
when you have a community that that

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,690
wants to work together and wants to work

00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:47,800
as a community you know we recognize

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:54,430
that we have to pick up each of these

00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:56,230
trash does that answer the question are

00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,970
only good basic social rules guidelines

00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,470
you recommend to a community that's just

00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,300
start starting up that they could use as

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,480
a sort of template I really like the

00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,700
Linux chicks be polite be helpful like

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,020
if you can't get that down there's

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,590
there's no point going on to anything

00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:13,320
more complex the other thing I would add

00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:18,420
is something from my talk yesterday if

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:20,710
you go to a vote consensus has failed I

00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,540
would suggest that if you're just

00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,400
starting up don't start up as a

00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,700
democracy don't start up as we vote on

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,960
everything startup consensus-based try

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,400
and achieve consensus because if you

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,140
can't achieve consensus with three or

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:38,470
four people you're never going to make

00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:41,110
it with a dozen how are you doing on

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:48,670
time we're five minutes over that's okay

00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:51,340
I just like to add to that for the Linux

00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:54,790
chicks one there one of the rules was

00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,200
most specifically not be nice and a lot

00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,650
of people kept thinking that that rule

00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:02,800
should be in there but it inhibits

00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:06,070
people who feel that being nice means

00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:09,610
don't argue or don't oppose or don't

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:12,100
criticize or more accurately don't give

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:14,530
any kind of feedback whether it's

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,570
constructive criticism or anything that

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,610
might be perceived as negative so the

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:22,300
bean be polite and be helpful was all

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:25,150
about it's okay to disagree just not

00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:27,010
necessarily so to make sure that you do

00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,200
so in a constructive and helpful and

00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:32,260
polite away yeah I think that's a very

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,900
good point striving for consensus does

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:37,990
not mean we don't agree sorry does not

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,490
mean we can't have disagreement if you

00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,500
can strive for consensus and still

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:44,410
disagree with each other consensus is

00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,090
not I agree with you consensuses I will

00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,270
allow you to continue doing this it's

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:51,140
about kind

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:52,250
sent not agreement if you're if I'm

00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,980
going to do something that's going to

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,540
fundamentally break our project you

00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,160
should step in and object if I'm going

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,800
to do something that you don't think is

00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,040
a great idea consensus still lets you

00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,660
say I think that's a really poor idea

00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:08,450
but allow me to go ahead with it and try

00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:14,870
it we have version control we can roll

00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:17,170
this stuff back do we have time for one

00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:20,180
more question one more question okay uh

00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:22,280
given your experience with what you see

00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,590
in your incubators and so on is there

00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,980
something specific that you see over and

00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:29,660
over in the perl communities mini

00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:33,380
communities around specific projects

00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:35,840
that you would recommend to be for

00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,760
dictators who try to rectify i think the

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,710
fact that they are dictators I think the

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,650
pattern I see over and over is that

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:47,180
Sipan modules and and the smaller pearl

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:49,370
communities and our and even the larger

00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:52,520
communities I by and large benevolent

00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:54,920
dictator ships and I think that goes

00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,710
very poorly for many types of people and

00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,780
goes most poorly for those types of

00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:02,030
people who are underrepresented it's

00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,040
very easy for a benevolent dictatorship

00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:06,530
to turn into a group of people who look

00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,880
like the dictator and again joins

00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:10,820
keynote talks a little bit more about

00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,770
this I would say try and work on this

00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:15,530
stuff try and move towards a consensus

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,690
driven model try and lay out the

00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,520
policies and the roadmap and put all of

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:21,260
these things in public so that people

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,100
can see what your project is about and

00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:27,410
what it takes to get involved but that

00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,030
would be what I would suggest and I

00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,480
think we are now way out of time but

00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,480
