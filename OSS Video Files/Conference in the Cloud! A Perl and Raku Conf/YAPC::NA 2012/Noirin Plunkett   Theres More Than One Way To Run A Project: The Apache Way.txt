give you the right one and me the right

00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:08,880
one excellent hopefully yes okay hi my

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:10,349
name is Noreen Plunkett and I am as

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,990
Shawon mentioned earlier the executive

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,639
vp of the apache software foundation

00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,839
what that means is I do the work and I

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,410
don't have to go to quite so many of the

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,990
meetings and the apache software

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,090
foundation is as some of you may or may

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,230
not know a lot bigger than just the web

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,539
server we're a 501 C 3 with the mission

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,840
of providing open source software for

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,670
the public good at no cost and what

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,239
we're trying to do by setting up the

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,460
foundation is to provide a shelter to

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,040
provide the infrastructure the project's

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,920
need so that open source contributors

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,750
can get on with what they like doing we

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,489
try to protect individuals from legal

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,739
threats that may come as a result of

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,320
their releasing code this was a much

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:58,170
bigger issue when the Apache group was

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,600
initially formed and coming out of the

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,010
ncsa community people were much more

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,739
afraid of that kind of thing nowadays

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:09,119
it's less of an issue we also hold

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,340
things like trademarks money domains all

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,470
of that kind of stuff keep those things

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,840
safe for our communities and we do that

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,210
as a community so that it's not just one

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,799
person who could disappear who could get

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:25,380
fed up who knows our license is

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,170
permissive business-friendly pragmatic

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,689
we try to make sure that you can do

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,439
whatever you want with our software and

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,509
we don't try to restrict that too only

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,369
people who want to look at the code but

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,290
people who want to sell it people who

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,450
want to wrap it up in a different rapper

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,299
put a new label on it all that kind of

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,979
stuff is fine with us we accept a

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,170
license a copyright license from our

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,619
contributors we don't accept copyright

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:56,189
grants so our contributors are free to

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,960
relicense their stuff elsewhere and it

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,360
just means that it's easier for people

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,979
who have various forms of work to hire

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,500
agreements and all of that kind of stuff

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:09,539
to work with us we're a membership-based

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,459
corporation were based in Delaware

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,260
because their laws are nice and easy and

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,849
the filing fee for your annual report is

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,250
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:21,010
we have six paid contractors we never

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,400
pay for development but we do pay for

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:27,549
full-time sis admin's one part-time

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,489
marketing and publicity lady and we have

00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:32,530
a part-time exec assistant who helps us

00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:34,299
organize our meetings keep our calendar

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,739
up-to-date remind us when we need to

00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:38,890
renew domains and all of that kind of

00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:41,950
stuff our budget is about three quarters

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,480
of a million dollars a year we spend on

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,510
the order of half a million dollars a

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,660
year on our technical infrastructure

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,090
about 150,000 on events which includes

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,590
both producing events and also getting

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,140
people to those events so we have a

00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,329
travel fund and we spend about a hundred

00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,560
thousand dollars a year on publicity

00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:02,109
most of which is used to make sure that

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,400
we continue to have that 750 thousand a

00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:09,370
year coming in the projects we have 10

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,200
cross foundation projects so those are

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,420
projects that exist to keep things up

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,709
and running the Events Committee the

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,829
infrastructure community the travel

00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:19,690
committee and so on we have 20 retired

00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:21,280
projects and I'll talk a little bit more

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,889
about retirement towards the end of the

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,299
talk we have 50 incubating projects and

00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:27,310
those are projects that are coming in

00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:28,810
learning how we work figuring out

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,120
whether Apache is where they want to be

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,120
and hopefully eventually becoming Apache

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,430
projects and at last count we have 102

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,650
top level although I realized we'd had a

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:43,569
board meeting since I last looked so we

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:45,669
may now have 105 we average about 400

00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:49,780
commits a day so about one every four

00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:52,239
minutes the legal structure is very much

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,010
top down the board exists to keep the

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,290
rest of us out of trouble it's a

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,590
nine-member board elected by the members

00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:02,650
of the foundation on an annual basis and

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:06,010
it's a very blunt instrument the board

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,590
very rarely gets involved in the work of

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:12,760
the projects when it does it tends to be

00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:15,099
an all-or-nothing thing the officers

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,239
report to the board on a monthly basis

00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,430
obviously with 100 and something

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,169
projects and only nine members on the

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,360
board they can't keep on top of

00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:25,810
absolutely everything so each project

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,580
has a VP responsible for reporting back

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,009
to the board once a quarter

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,379
and typically those reports are so and

00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:35,590
so many new committers such and such

00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:37,419
activity this many releases and that's

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,419
about all the board needs to know unless

00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:41,949
there's a problem and the VP's had those

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:43,330
project management committees which

00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:46,330
again I'll talk about a little bit more

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,129
in a moment on the technical side we go

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:52,719
absolutely the other direction we start

00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:55,719
with our contributors we have about 4200

00:04:52,719 --> 00:05:00,370
contributors who have a copyright

00:04:55,719 --> 00:05:02,650
license on file with us about 3200 of

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:06,610
those are committers so they actually

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,840
have a commit and then the project

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,620
management committees I should actually

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,270
run the numbers on this but each each

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,419
project has a project management

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:21,370
committee typically at least 10 people

00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:25,599
and I think the httpd is on the order of

00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:28,000
50 to 60 people so that's probably the

00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:30,009
biggest one that we have and those

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,830
project management committees have two

00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:36,009
responsibilities they vote on releases

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:38,319
and that gives us the the legal backing

00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:40,180
to say yes this is a release of the

00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,520
foundation and you needn't worry about

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,740
liability they also vote in New

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,240
committers no other business is

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,580
conducted by the project management

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,740
committees everything else is conducted

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:55,210
on our public lists to which anybody is

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:58,770
welcome to contribute and the principles

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:02,889
on which those public lists operate

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:06,120
collaboration consensus oversight non

00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:08,460
affiliation diversity and a duoc recy

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,509
sometimes we'll use the word meritocracy

00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:14,139
but I'll cover a bit more about the

00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:15,789
difference when we get there we believe

00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:17,589
if it didn't happen on a mailing list it

00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:20,110
didn't happen there are a couple of

00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:22,389
reasons for this first of all it gives

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:25,810
people an opportunity to chime in not

00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:27,909
everybody's at their computer 24-7 we

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,460
have a huge diversity of contributors

00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:33,729
across the world different time zones

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,680
different lifestyles and so we ask

00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:37,750
people to put everything on the mailing

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,209
list we also have a diversity of

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,390
contributors over the 15 years of the

00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:43,400
Foundation's life

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,590
and by putting things on mailing lists

00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,200
it's much easier to search those

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,910
archives to see what happened you can

00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,620
google it we have obviously our own

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:56,480
search project so we also use that and

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,730
so when an argument needs to be rehashed

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,980
you can see what the decision was last

00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,780
time what the arguments were and you can

00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,480
say has anything changed or has it not

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,460
do we need to bring this up again no we

00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,450
covered that two years ago it's still

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,860
state is still the same so nothing

00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:16,430
obviously we have discussions on IRC we

00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:19,930
have a lot of user help on IRC we have

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,880
we meet in person we have a lot of beer

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,890
things things get done in person but if

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,120
it doesn't go back to a mailing list get

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,500
reported to the mailing list get

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,330
discussed on the mailing list and get

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:34,010
agreed on the mailing list it's not a

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:37,040
decision how do we agree things we

00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:39,550
operate on a consensus basis consensus

00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,930
does not mean I like what you're doing

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:46,010
consensus means I'm willing to let you

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:48,050
do what you're doing we have version

00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:52,790
control we actually have our own version

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:54,890
control project subversion we can roll

00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:59,000
things back you commit something that we

00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:01,070
don't like that's okay it's it's bitten

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,700
in a source control tree it's really

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:07,490
easy that said we very rarely do roll

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,840
things back it's really not that

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,910
difficult when you're working on a

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,770
project with people to have a sense for

00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,540
where things are going to have a sense

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,900
for what's going to be controversial and

00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,550
to be able to speak up and say hey you

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,160
know I want to change the way that we

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,540
load our modules everybody has a

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,680
different opinion on how we should do

00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:30,770
this let's talk it through any decision

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,510
needs to allow 72 hours again to allow

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,790
all of those people in different time

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:38,510
zones different holidays and so on to

00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:40,790
have a chance to chime in and and it's

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,350
just social controls nobody is going to

00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:46,820
actually prevent you from committing

00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:50,420
something after 48 hours but be nice to

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,720
each other get in the habit of it and it

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,720
sticks

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,560
the oversight is very important from a

00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:03,480
legal perspective but also from a social

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:09,149
perspective the rule of three goes three

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:12,029
days three people lazy consensus is fine

00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:13,740
we don't actually have to agree on

00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:15,930
everything and have everybody give their

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:21,660
voice if you don't say anything we

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:23,959
assume you're ok with it um pardon may

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:27,209
have there was one other thing oh yes

00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:31,140
consensus if you get to a vote you

00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:34,529
failed the whole point of consensus is

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,450
we don't need to have a vote okay we can

00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:38,610
have a sort of a sense of hey what do

00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,140
you guys think put your hands up don't

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,899
actually need to count every one of them

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,250
I can get a sense of the room without

00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:46,350
knowing you know there's 17 people who

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:51,630
say yes and 16 you say no well that's

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:54,149
not consensus back to the rule of three

00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,910
we require non affiliation everybody

00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:58,410
participates as an individual companies

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,870
cannot join the apache software

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,660
foundation they can gladly give us money

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,700
will be very happy to accept that but

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,100
they cannot join they do not have a

00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:11,040
voice they do not have a vote we never

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,329
pay for development and the one of the

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,430
reasons that we never pay for

00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:17,370
development is that we refuse to allow a

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,600
situation where you only have two or

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,089
three people who understand how the

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,670
codebase works from the Apache

00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:27,209
perspective that is where we started we

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:29,430
started with the ncsa httpd and there

00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:31,380
were literally half a dozen people who

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,089
knew how that worked and they were

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,950
trying to maintain it and trying to keep

00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:39,329
it going because their jobs depended on

00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:42,839
it and they said never again and so now

00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:45,630
there are 60 people who work on the HTTP

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,300
server probably 20 of whom are actively

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,790
working on it like in the last week or

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,440
two not all of whom understand the whole

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,720
thing we probably only have three guys

00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:58,800
who really understand the windows side

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,230
of things but if we were to get down to

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,820
two guys we would start actively looking

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,050
for more people to get involved and

00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,050
pushing that side of things

00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:13,199
and back to diversity my talk got ahead

00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:16,079
of my slides the duoc recy the

00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:19,230
difference between marys and doing Marik

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:22,499
never expires 10 years ago you were the

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:24,029
guy who you know wrote the testing suite

00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:26,399
longer than that you were the guy who

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:28,439
wrote the HTTP RFC you know we have

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,410
those people around but if you're not

00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:34,410
actively working on stuff that's great

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,629
we respect what you did but now we're

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:40,730
going forward we're moving on or

00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:43,559
changing how we do things that's okay

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,850
it's not going to it's not going to go

00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,860
all down the tubes and if it does start

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:50,670
going down the tubes come back and start

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,489
working on it fix it change it it's it's

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:56,189
software copying this stuff it's not

00:11:53,489 --> 00:12:01,129
expensive making another one not

00:11:56,189 --> 00:12:03,239
difficult um merit is not transferable

00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:05,519
doesn't matter if you're a guy who wrote

00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:07,470
the HTTP RFC you want to go over and

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,600
work on a different project you start

00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,519
from the beginning you start in the same

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,410
place where everybody else starts and

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,449
one of the huge advantages of this is

00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:18,899
because we have a lot of projects that

00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:20,549
interrelate that work together you've

00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,860
got that guy you really like and respect

00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:25,290
who's just coming in as a newbie to your

00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,999
project you're going to make sure that

00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:29,489
the processes you have for newbies are

00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:31,619
welcoming and friendly and easy to

00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:34,079
understand because you don't want it

00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:38,610
look like a jackass in front of people

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,350
you really respect I mentioned earlier

00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:43,410
the projects that we have an incubation

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:47,369
an incubation is where we learn about

00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:50,129
the Apache way we try and help projects

00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:51,899
get over first of all the legal hurdles

00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:54,179
making sure that all of their licensing

00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:57,509
and so on is in order but really truly

00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:59,569
to understand the community values most

00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,799
of the projects that enter incubation

00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:04,949
graduate from incubation and become top

00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,589
level projects the fastest one I think

00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:10,019
was the subversion project which ferry

00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:12,299
call took three months from entering

00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:15,029
incubation to graduating and most of

00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:18,029
that was spent on sorting at all of the

00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:19,920
legal side of things because they

00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,389
already had a structure the

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,440
was very much based on the Apache

00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:27,060
principles the longest one I think we've

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,980
had was two years after which the

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,570
community decided this wasn't for them

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,700
and that's just fine there's no hard

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:37,560
feelings we are happy to accept projects

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,540
that are working on in the same space

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,579
we're happy to accept projects that are

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,880
different implementations of the same

00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:46,410
standard competition is fine but we

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,440
prefer it if you'll work together and

00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:52,139
try and find a way that suits everybody

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,500
we don't like to have this is my turf

00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:58,920
and this is your turf and if you need

00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,690
another piece of software we like to eat

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:05,070
our own dog food where we can that's why

00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:07,199
we don't Google our mail archives on the

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:11,100
other side we have the attic where

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:14,370
communities that are ready to wrap up go

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,860
to sometimes that's an active community

00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:20,790
that just says nope Apache not working

00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:24,529
out for us we've had two of those in the

00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:29,130
time that I've been around most recently

00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:31,170
was the I baddest community who forked

00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,940
over to google code we're still

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,070
discussing what exactly will happen with

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,040
the trademark there because they had the

00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,589
trademark for I baddest and we really

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,930
only accept voluntary donations and if

00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:44,430
you want to go and take your stuff we're

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,740
willing to let that happen but we have

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,660
to make sure as a 501 C 3 there are

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:55,050
certain legal requirements in who we

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:56,820
give our assets to and the previous one

00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:00,410
I'm actually less familiar with so I'm

00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:02,819
not even going to go into we also have

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,160
projects that are no longer relevant so

00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:10,069
for example Apache harmony was a

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:12,420
reimplement ation of the Java spec

00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:14,220
unfortunately son were never willing to

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,459
give us a test compatibility kit that

00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:21,329
would allow us to release open source

00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:23,970
software and so we decided to wrap up

00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:25,350
that project they they were one of the

00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,269
few Apache projects I think over the

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:30,630
course of ten years they never actually

00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:33,570
made a release releases are one of the

00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:36,150
things that can never be vetoed Apache

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,370
so it was all social controls it was all

00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:43,290
a matter of what's the right thing for

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:46,710
our community community / code is our

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,210
other motto we don't like to have you

00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,160
build the whole power plant and then

00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,860
check it in all in one go it's just

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,010
really rude it's just really hard to be

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:59,400
on the receiving end of that bike sheds

00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:02,540
are worse let's let's get going let's

00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:06,330
keep moving keep the momentum up and

00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:08,160
geniuses commodity doesn't matter we

00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,650
don't want rock stars we really don't

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,740
accepted the lightning talks that's fine

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:16,200
that's great but when we're writing code

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,510
let's all work together you are not more

00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:24,590
amazing than any of the rest of us and

00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:33,180
if you are that's fine go elsewhere um

00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:34,650
bike shed oh it should be green that's a

00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,570
bike shed where we've built the whole

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,100
power plant and now we're arguing over

00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,630
the color of the bike shed because it's

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:44,850
something simple that everybody feels

00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:46,980
they can have an opinion on um I am I

00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,530
think just about out of time I will

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,800
mention the rule of three this talk is

00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:54,210
typically not given by an individual

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,910
typically we give this talk in groups of

00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:59,340
three because three different people

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,960
have three different you know ideas of

00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,630
exactly what we're doing how we're doing

00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,180
it what's most important the second link

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:09,420
bear the community dad Apache org has

00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:13,650
the written version of all of these

00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,570
principles and policies but we also tend

00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,060
not to point people at that because it's

00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:19,709
much better to get it from somebody who

00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,900
says well you know this is what's

00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:23,760
written down but here are the ways that

00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:27,089
it can differ sometimes there's their

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,040
edge cases there are complications the

00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,930
poisonous people is a much longer

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,660
version of this talk given by two people

00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,940
who are much funnier than I am and the

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,740
final link is if you have any questions

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,450
I'd be more than happy to take them I'll

00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,620
be back in this room on no pardon me

00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:48,200
I'll be in the lower dining room

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,200
