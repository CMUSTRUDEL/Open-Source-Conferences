well yeah if you want to grab the slides

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,200
yourself or at least look at them they

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,320
are at that URL that's of course as you

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,199
see the HTML not the pod um this is

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:26,939
actually all written in pod somewhere

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:29,160
here right so if you change it you just

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:37,410
type if you're in the right directory

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:38,940
make so this talk is on natural language

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,510
processing in Perl

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,250
for the last two years until the end of

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:50,840
January I worked at the University of

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:56,039
Colorado doing computational

00:00:50,840 --> 00:01:01,410
pharmacology which means analyzing the

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:03,960
text of biomedical journal articles and

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:14,460
trying to do things you can't do with

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:19,470
Google so NLP is natural language

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:21,780
processing it's not necessarily the same

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,930
thing as computational linguistics and

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:32,520
it just depends on who you're talking to

00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:36,000
and the thing that I think everybody

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:40,100
probably knows is that using a computer

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:48,060
to pretend it's a as smart as a human in

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:51,810
understanding text is not easy when your

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:56,549
compiler finds a syntax error it blows

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:59,490
up and you're expected to fix it when a

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,350
human finds a syntax error he's supposed

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,759
to figure out what you mean and keep

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:08,360
going and these are these are very

00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,360
distinct kinds of things

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,110
doing things right is hard I mean the

00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,870
same word can be a completely different

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,400
part of speech even though you know it's

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,829
the second word in that sentence and the

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:30,680
second word in that sentence but it's a

00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:32,900
completely different thing human

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,980
language is tricky to make a computer

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:39,620
figure out what it's doing

00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:42,349
I once analyzed the OED x' list of

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:48,530
exceptional plural nouns and there are

00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:52,310
about 2,500 irregular x' of four hundred

00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:57,319
different categories so you can't just

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:59,299
write i like ends in us make it a ended

00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:05,120
i kind of rule because you need four

00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:07,609
hundred of those and then without word

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,340
sense disambiguation you will without

00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:13,489
understanding it you will never be able

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:18,680
to figure out whether the word basis is

00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:20,599
the plural of base or the plural of

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:27,199
basis or the singular of the verb base

00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:29,959
right lucky basis it's hard stuff this

00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,480
is a my font is way too small for you

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:36,049
guys back there that's okay most of the

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,370
slides aren't that bad i've i'm focusing

00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:41,419
this talk on something called

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:48,709
morphological analysis there are many

00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:53,120
other NLP topics myra don't i can't

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:55,669
click focus like that the original when

00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,109
we say parsing we actually mean

00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:02,599
analyzing the syntax i chose just

00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:05,030
stemming and limitation for this talk

00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:07,099
because it's small enough and focused

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:13,069
enough that i might be able to say

00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:14,750
something in 17 minutes but these other

00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:17,630
there's a lot to it there's a lot of

00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:21,200
these things so on Sipan there are

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,190
actually a bunch of NLP modules there

00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,670
are

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,970
quite a few people working in NLP in

00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,970
Perl

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,710
there's a fellow in Portugal Alberto

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:39,620
Savoia who's got his whole like a whole

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:41,660
department working on it so so if you've

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,200
worked in the field before you might

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,020
recognize a few of the words on here

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:53,750
like the jenni attire tagger or the

00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:57,350
Stanford core and sometimes there are

00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:00,740
purl interfaces to these things and that

00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:02,630
means you have to get their c or java

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:06,080
library and somehow in their face to it

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:09,170
sometimes it's simple enough that you

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,600
can just write it from scratch and purl

00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:15,830
that doesn't happen very often although

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:20,230
people try it very often so the problem

00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:22,880
is that a lot of the Sipan modules are

00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:25,780
the nicest thing i can say about them is

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,880
that they're not ready for primetime

00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:30,860
they're they're really just toys you

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,890
can't use them for real work so you got

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,860
to look really hard at these things to

00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:39,080
see if they're like lingua dum :

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,680
sentence you know what does that do well

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:46,580
you might figure it out that it tries to

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:49,550
split a paragraph or a body of text into

00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,470
sentences but does it do it right you

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,850
know there are there are many mountains

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,850
out there that think they can just use

00:05:52,850 --> 00:06:01,370
regular expressions to do that and you

00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:03,140
can't don't get don't think you have to

00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,900
stick in the lingua hierarchy you can go

00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:10,600
outside for example for working on this

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:14,150
last edition of the camel we used - -

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:18,080
because they're silly word processing

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:22,610
software had didn't understand English -

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:25,750
Asian rules so I had to up and there's

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:28,810
stuff in text too that might be useful

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,810
okay so

00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:38,590
the kind of morphological analysis we're

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:42,360
going to talk about here is the big long

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,360
word for it where is the big long word

00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:52,300
effects removal conflation techniques so

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,490
let's say you just want to say how many

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,610
times does the word cannon appear in

00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,950
this text or how many times does the

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:05,800
word you know canonize parent this text

00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:08,320
now it's a lot easier in English because

00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,310
English doesn't have much in the way of

00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,710
inflectional morphology conjugation

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,590
stuff imagine if you were in Spanish or

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,090
Latin or something you you've got all

00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,350
these words that don't look like the

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:28,180
word you're looking for but they are

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:29,770
that work is Canyon and canyons is

00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,340
probably referring to the same thing

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:36,100
although that's a but they might might

00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:40,330
be a mountain own it might be verbal

00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,920
and yes Canyon with until there is a in

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:46,240
English word and it's not the same as

00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:48,310
Canon then you get spelling variants so

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,130
when you're reading journal articles

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,340
from The Lancet out of the UK they use

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:59,590
the SC forms and so the ze forms and

00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:02,320
other silly things like that canonicity

00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:05,610
z' and Canon City are the same Canyon

00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,610
City is in Colorado nevermind

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:14,770
so all this stuff we'll talk about today

00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:19,020
its goal is to chop off the ends of

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,020
these strings to get to a common form

00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:27,700
you can kind of do that with nouns you

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:32,680
can only go so far with it for verbs

00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:37,240
like speak spoke spoken right none of

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:42,190
them in fact deal with prefixes it's

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:47,260
only suffixes but when you are doing

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:52,510
event detection and relation extraction

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:55,210
you actually care about prefixes

00:08:52,510 --> 00:09:02,590
sometimes as well because to on whatever

00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:05,700
is a negated event or to D something so

00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:09,400
the whole goal is trying to find a

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:14,470
citation form or a bit the base version

00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:17,860
of it just chopping off the suffixes

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,540
we'll call stemming whereas actually so

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,140
when you stem something you just go chop

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:25,600
chop chop until you get a short word it

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,190
doesn't actually mean a word so the

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:33,330
results of stemming something is just

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:35,740
the start of a word it's context-free

00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:39,030
the lemma today ssin on the other hand

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:44,460
uses grammar and is context-sensitive

00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:44,460
and it does reduce to a dictionary word

00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:51,490
dictionary words are funny things some

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,530
people would say that these there should

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,930
just be one word for these first five

00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,470
entries that begin with the canyon or

00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,620
conn-young

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:02,290
and that's from the OED so you can't

00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,630
just throw away the Tobi's and there are

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:07,900
two kinds of cannons they're totally

00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:10,240
different novels and when it's not

00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:13,930
enough when you're doing sophisticated

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,450
work or even have sophisticated work to

00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:19,320
conflate those two but we'll be doing

00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,320
that this tomorrow

00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,370
so churches to church examining to exam

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:32,560
in just chopping things off again the

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:34,270
real it's kind of like converting

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:40,300
everything to lowercase to make them all

00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:41,980
look the same and no one says ethics

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,510
removal conflation technique although if

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,040
you can figure out what those words mean

00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:50,280
it does describe it better than stemming

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:55,630
their context free there's no grammar

00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:59,890
the kind of textbook work that everybody

00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:02,340
uses is the porter stemmer which was

00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:08,890
invented by dr. martin porter and about

00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:12,130
80 or 86 was a long time ago since then

00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:14,130
he has improved his work and re-released

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:18,250
it and it's now called the snowball

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:20,290
stemmer it's still dr. Porter's work but

00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,600
you use the two different sometimes

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:28,090
people say porter stemmer when they mean

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:30,130
the snowball stemmer by dr. Porter they

00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,960
just do this kind of thing they look at

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,460
a suffix at the end and jump it off oh

00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,100
it's a little bit better than that but

00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,440
not much

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,360
so the original porter stemmer is

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,600
available as a pure perl module called

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:52,230
linguae double colon stem it runs on

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:56,530
anti millennial versions of Perl and it

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:57,820
it has an oo API and you have to look

00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:02,410
these up to see what they actually

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:06,760
return to get at them there if you do it

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:09,490
this way it's really slow so what you

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,200
want to do is feed a bunch of words at

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,440
once to your stemmer and have it work

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,870
out all of them at once um and hopefully

00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:21,760
not even give them back to you well what

00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:25,060
good does that do because Perl does you

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,720
pass things by implicit reference so

00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:31,060
it's got pointers to the original data

00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,280
obviously just changing the length on

00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,350
those strings will be much faster than

00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,500
allocating more memory and sin

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,090
were chomping from the end you just bump

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,990
up thee you change the end of string

00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,700
pointer it's fine

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:46,600
and that's how you'll get your best

00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:48,930
performance the snowball stemmer which

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:53,080
is the newer of the two by dr. quarter

00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:55,600
does require a C compiler and it

00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:05,770
requires this completely modern version

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:09,760
of Perl 5.8 and the eight it does it's

00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:11,140
generally an improved algorithm it has a

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,390
little bit better support for

00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:18,490
non-english notice here I special

00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:21,910
specify a locale and here a language and

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,470
an encoding I have no idea what happens

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,430
if you lie about the encoding I assume

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,430
it just is horrible

00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,380
another stemmer and one that's actually

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,560
moving towards being a lemma tiser is

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:46,850
the lancaster stemmer this is a recent

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:54,110
one the reason it's better I'll show you

00:13:46,850 --> 00:14:00,230
examples is that it has more rules about

00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:02,960
spelling exceptions almost grammar rules

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:05,330
so you're moving into what limit izing

00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,430
does there are other algorithms that are

00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:09,830
older that are not much used people

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:12,050
generally use the the current porter

00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:19,130
stemmer which is snow ball or this

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:22,160
Lancaster one it's the I'm on slide 11 I

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:24,760
mean just for you guys taking notes

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,980
remember that the you can pull these

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:32,990
slides from that URL training.com

00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:38,210
Yahtzee 2012 / little NLP dot HTML and

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:41,080
I'll put that up at the end too so

00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:43,070
here's a good demonstration of the

00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:46,780
different kinds of things those three

00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,780
algorithms are going to pull out for you

00:14:46,960 --> 00:15:03,710
notice it doesn't take it down to a

00:14:50,830 --> 00:15:06,980
necessarily to a dictionary Hepler for

00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:11,930
the most part especially the the porter

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:24,980
stuff really works mostly on now it's

00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:26,660
not verbs although here but it does lots

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,640
of stupid things I guess I'll show you

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,030
those later

00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:34,400
now what matrices into metric probably

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:37,850
not a good idea

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,940
I mean for some purposes any of these

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:45,680
are fine the important thing to do is to

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:47,600
always use this same algorithm for when

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,780
you store your words in a you know a

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,540
hash of these stems as when you're

00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:56,840
processing it it doesn't matter so much

00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:01,160
um which one you do you just have to be

00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:05,630
completely consistent and of course you

00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,890
will and five minutes to go I'm not

00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:11,780
going to talk about the trade-off

00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:14,240
between precision and recall but the

00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,500
more things turn into the same thing the

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,970
more when you look them up you don't

00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:21,230
know which the original it was so you

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,810
have a good chance of finding it but you

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:26,180
don't know what you found levitt izing

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:33,920
is a smarter approach requires much more

00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:35,480
work it's not just nouns it's also verbs

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:41,390
you know finding the base form the

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:44,440
infinitive it does it is a context the

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:47,510
best limit ization is context-sensitive

00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,600
because you you pass in the part of

00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:52,370
speech for that word because you'll get

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:57,460
totally different results on a different

00:16:52,370 --> 00:17:02,110
part of speech so Leben eyes errs use

00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:05,060
both dictionary lookups and because

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:07,040
human human beings have this really

00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,620
annoying tendency to make up words that

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,300
don't exist and expect you to know what

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,240
they mean

00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:17,209
which means you constantly encounter

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,610
words that are not in the dictionary so

00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,860
especially when you're doing biomedical

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:27,470
text you've got all these fancy long

00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:29,180
words that now when I first came to this

00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,310
I thought limit izing would have been

00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,960
useful for that I thought it's reducing

00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,220
it to the bound morphemes and splitting

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,680
it all up into separate pieces but

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,810
that's not what they mean by this that

00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,310
actually would be useful since even the

00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:43,160
scientists usually when they create new

00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:46,040
words these guys use Greek and Greek and

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,090
Roman Greek in Latin words to put them

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,580
together

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:56,720
so instead of just dictionary lookups

00:17:49,580 --> 00:18:00,580
you also need inflection roles now they

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,289
aren't very smart if I had a stickum

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:06,830
that ends in um and I wanted a couple of

00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:07,640
those STI CK um you guys would know it

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,799
would be stickum z'

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,799
no one would say stick ax because

00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:15,260
there's no I guess Greek can have a

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,330
liquid st but there's no CK in the

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,130
middle of a Greek or Latin word so it

00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,320
must be an English type word so you just

00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:25,700
add s these things don't quite that

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:28,429
smart they're much better when you have

00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,649
the tag taggers a tagger is something

00:18:28,429 --> 00:19:03,860
that assigns a part of speech to each

00:18:30,649 --> 00:19:08,210
word it turns out you can't do good

00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:15,649
tagging without any syntax you have to

00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:17,929
have contest so the best taggers so some

00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:20,929
of the parsers by which I mean syntactic

00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:22,760
analyzers can also act as taggers and

00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:26,480
will give you both the pars and part of

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:29,720
speech tags so you use that stuff that

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,740
comes back to you and you pass in the

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:37,070
word and the part of speech and it'll

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:40,370
uninflected so all these lemma ties errs

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:43,429
deal with inflectional morphology noun

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:47,330
and pronoun cases singulars plurals

00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:50,950
conjugations tenses and inflecting

00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,950
adjectives good better best

00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:58,760
they don't do derivational morphology

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,840
they don't do adding Asian on the end or

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,950
adding isay

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:08,870
on the end the one that I've worked with

00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:14,210
does the it does know about ly for

00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:17,630
adverbs and there's this tool that we

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:20,179
worked on at Colorado it's called the

00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:24,070
bio lemma tiser there is a big long

00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:29,690
paper on it I'll tell you in a second

00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:32,690
and it uses it's been trained on the

00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:39,159
specialist vocabulary from the National

00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:42,620
Library of medicines big expensive

00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:44,779
corpus a bunch of words so it does very

00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,090
does it's the best thing out there on

00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:50,470
biomedical texts

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:55,370
it's actually an ugly bit of Java code

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:57,230
pile of Java code and other things so I

00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:01,190
didn't want to work in Java I don't know

00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:03,409
why so I wrote a Perl module called

00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:07,520
Linkwood double en Bielema Tizer

00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:13,640
it just starts up this slave Java thing

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:15,710
it talks to it on an open to when you

00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,110
get the slides you can get the reference

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:22,779
to the original journal paper it is 29

00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:29,149
pages long if you can read it then

00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:31,659
you're smarter than a computer so you

00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:34,820
can call it a CLI thing you can call it

00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:37,100
procedurally where you can pass a word

00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:41,270
without any context or you can pass

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:43,490
that's a penn treebank tag it's a part

00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:47,799
of speech that's a discrete set of

00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:52,779
abbreviations and it gives you back an

00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:58,909
answer it's usually the right answer so

00:21:52,779 --> 00:22:04,149
you'll never see that any chance of

00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:10,770
seeing that me so these are things that

00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:14,880
stammers are crap at there's regulars

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:27,270
mouths so we we weren't able to use the

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:30,110
existing stuff because I have to make it

00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,110
small or don't I

00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:37,890
I'm just trying to see which we're by

00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:39,020
stuff is here what's the citation form

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:42,150
for ours

00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,010
well for some purposes you just want we

00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,650
because it's a second person plural

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:49,380
pronoun and you don't care that it's in

00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:57,300
a genitive case you just want the

00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:58,800
simplest form so you can get Bielema

00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,500
tiser if you want to do this kind of

00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,670
work and it does much better it's a lot

00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,670
it's a lot slower

00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:24,839
so I think that's like almost all the

00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,719
time I have

00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:31,729
and then someone three minutes late any

00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:35,579
questions about this I'll put the oh

00:23:31,729 --> 00:23:37,379
wait sorry one more slide so the bio

00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:38,969
lemma tiser doesn't just return a word

00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:49,379
it returns a whole bunch of interesting

00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:54,779
information so for example text it might

00:23:49,379 --> 00:24:06,659
be now there are two different taxes

00:23:54,779 --> 00:24:08,519
that tax yeah you can also return so

00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:10,789
that this will help us word sense

00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:10,789
disambiguation

00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:25,780
like you art what kind of word is heart

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:30,360
well it's either a simple noun or it's a

00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:32,530
verb in the second person no really so

00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,960
what you do with the results is up to

00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:57,910
you

00:24:33,960 --> 00:25:06,210
and there's the URL again questions we

00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:06,210
ran it I did pretty well on

00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:43,240
yes the question is is there a list of

00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:45,640
modules worth bothering with this is one

00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,740
list of them I didn't put anything on

00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:55,540
here that I thought you should never

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:58,510
ever look at who does NOP work here

00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:01,600
who's ever done an LLP work there's a

00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:04,420
fair number of you cool yes I know I

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,430
have to make them all go away other

00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,320
questions

00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:14,770
there's no Unicode in this talk was

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:18,000
there sometimes it turns out that all

00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:18,000
the standard dictionaries are

00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:45,800
yeah the stammers do the stammers do

00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:48,250
support other languages can t remember

00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,250
mine

00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:56,890
no the bio limit Iser runs off the

00:26:53,860 --> 00:27:01,220
National Library of medicines specialist

00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:06,070
vocabulary so that one is specifically

00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:06,070
English the stem errs are much simpler

00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:12,680
that was dumb I should have tried them

00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:15,860
on other languages because you can't

00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,560
just think of stem changing verbs in

00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,570
Italian or Spanish or French

00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,930
you can't just stem down to you know

00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:26,270
Jake in play if you go down to tiene

00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:30,380
instead of 10-year you'll it doesn't

00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:32,840
work right so the thing is snowball has

00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:35,120
very good international support so if

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,780
all you need is stemming yes you can do

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:42,080
it I don't know how well it does on

00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,760
Latin I mean I I do I do know and it's

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:49,180
not very good I think it's that part is

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,180
toy hey questions I guess

00:28:05,870 --> 00:29:14,900
oh I don't like mics okay so yes I fit

00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:17,890
the entire OAD into it not as training

00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:20,240
where is training data there's test data

00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:22,070
well that's not quite what it is but

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,920
it's not all the only DS exceptions so

00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:27,020
it should do assuming it's words you can

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:30,350
look up in the OED it should do well and

00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:34,309
if it's not it falls back to detachment

00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:36,020
rules inflection rules it might probably

00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:39,460
would think the FIR love stick on the

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,460
stick up unfortunately but

00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:57,029
NLP work not in English general I will

00:29:53,009 --> 00:30:04,979
run dry and pay and when Allegra get no

00:29:57,029 --> 00:30:05,969
saying less okay oh did you oh that's

00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:08,999
very interesting

00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:13,200
so just what figure out where the words

00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:15,059
are is told is hard in Chinese yes word

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:20,039
segmentation when you don't have white

00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:21,809
space hmm I told you this stuff is hard

00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:25,200
and it's fun too

00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:29,839
there's um there's a bunch being done in

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,839
Portuguese and even some in Brazilian I

00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,609
don't know about I don't know how many

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:38,789
people are using it for the high

00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:44,789
throughput large memory stuff that they

00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:46,829
use Java for but it's easier to hire

00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:53,820
Java programmers than Perl programmers

00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:58,169
these days well I have another talk in

00:30:53,820 --> 00:31:01,320
like an hour or something and and that

00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:06,149
one is two hours long so I won't have to

00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:08,729
rush quite so much again the you can

00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:12,299
pull the slides from there like at least

00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:17,369
the HTML I died all arranged to put the

00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:21,059
pot up later okay
