yes that's going to be everyone guys so

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,469
I'm going to start a bit earlier today

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:15,480
um most of my top is actually not about

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:19,050
it more about what so it is a while to

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,029
talk so what are we talking today mostly

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,859
about is what the problem is with

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,010
medical reasons right now in Canada

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,310
that's why I hence the maple syrup and

00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:31,790
what we are trying to do and why we

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,370
decided to go and start using cool so

00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:37,140
before I start and and forgive the state

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,899
of the slide I can't get internet

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,300
working right now so my original talk is

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,680
somewhere else but I don't really need

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,989
the slide that much I just wanted to get

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,789
my point across a little bit more

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,940
comfortable in a little bit more of a

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,640
comfortable talk than usual so I i

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,559
started pulled this out of mine i

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,960
started working on a module called sdl

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,660
poll which many people don't know about

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,840
it's about co gaming currently I'm doing

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,030
my masters in biomedical engineering so

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,380
that means i do do some research I'm a

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:13,080
researcher and the area that I look at

00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,750
specifically is a the area between the

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,820
disconnect between medical front line

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,390
and what's happening in pharmaceutical

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,820
companies in terms of clinical trial so

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:29,070
that's a bit of a boring part but using

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:32,340
this kind of problem area I started a

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,100
startup that we're working on right now

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,299
and what I want to talk to you about is

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,490
connected style connect us then is north

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,700
of here some people like to call it

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,890
Canada but really it in terms of medical

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,220
research a today tater ship so that's

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,070
what i call it connected then um medical

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,750
research in canada is very linear you

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,490
start a process you finish the process

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,070
you start the next process you finish

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,259
the next process and each single process

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,950
has startup costs which have the exact

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,459
same for each component of the process

00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:10,140
the reason why we have some insane stuff

00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:11,430
like that stuff like this it because we

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,480
have a very conservative software

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,569
ecosystem

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,060
people in Canada who have the ability to

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,440
buy and bring a new software don't have

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,670
the balls to buy and bring a new

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,400
software so what happens is when people

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,470
want clinical trials in Canada and this

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,140
briefly a clinical trial is the gold

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,810
standard for getting any new medical

00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,930
device pharmaceutical or anything

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,160
related with doing anything to human

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,400
through the system so you can actually

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,040
start selling it so clinical trials is

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,980
how things are done and for the most

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,930
part in hotels were run well except when

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,379
you need to look at up-to-date

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,599
information very little of the front-end

00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,220
medical real-time information is ever

00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,900
used in a clinical trial because

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,780
clinical trial as I mentioned are linear

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,400
but take maybe eight months just to get

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,470
started then they take another year or

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,079
two years where you spend all this time

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,900
looking at retrospective data but by

00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:11,790
that time you've all read the data set

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,440
has already started changing so you have

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,940
a latency period so for about two years

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,739
new stuff has been going on new drugs

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,930
are out on the market your demographic

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,450
attained the biochemistry of your

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,370
patients obtained and this stuff is not

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:31,019
available no one's looking at it because

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:32,700
it just takes so bloody long so why so

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,930
we started looking into me and my

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,000
partner we started looking into why is

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:40,230
it hard to get real-time information

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,750
coming out of art of the front end first

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,220
of all it's hard to access and has

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,410
something to do with phones and Frank's

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,440
friend and what I mean by transference

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,780
is getting data from one person to

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,930
another person in Hannah right now even

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,489
the US in some state everything's pen

00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,900
and paper even look at an electronic

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:02,790
system on the side when they have an

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,290
electronic systems they're still based

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,840
on some of the designs that we're done

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,280
way back in the 80s way back in the 90s

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,349
and what's happening with that is the

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,660
technology is getting away so people are

00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:14,790
actually going back and using kind of

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,070
paper as you're done redundant system to

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,229
what they're currently doing so it is

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,479
somewhat of a comfort feeling with

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:23,669
physicians if they have the paper copy

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:24,130
while they have their technology and

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:26,380
we're going

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,450
the back end somos tmr's right now don't

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,500
even bother having a good UI because in

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,570
the end they're just going to print it

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,180
out and then shuffle the forms across

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:38,260
the floor so that means real-time

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,850
information just to get any sort of data

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,240
set out of that you have to sift through

00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,830
about millions and millions of pieces of

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,650
paper and as a research that I've done

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:50,890
this not willingly I've done this myself

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,870
where for eight months we sit there and

00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,670
go back through every single paper copy

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,920
of a patient and the problem with the

00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,870
paper copy is they're not accurate at

00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,900
all because when the citizen writes

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,680
anything down on an operative note or a

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,020
physician write anything down on an

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,850
operative know it scribbles and if it's

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,950
not scribble it's inaccurate and if it's

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,800
inaccurate that's an F it's not

00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,600
inaccurate then maybe you somehow found

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,670
the last unicorn of narni has some

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,500
somewhere so that data set just sucks so

00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:23,580
that's one of the big reasons why

00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:27,130
real-time data is not being brought into

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:30,070
clinical trials so what happens when a

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:32,080
clinical trial witnesses off is they

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,090
realize oh we have another data set to

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,210
go through so they have a huge money

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:41,020
drain it's a huge effort grain and just

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,430
a huge drain and the solution well it's

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,380
not as simple as making something better

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:49,000
so you hit a little story time today and

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,180
what I'll be talking about is Oscar it's

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,160
open source Canadian whatever it is but

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,340
basically this was one of the better

00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,340
systems for a Mars that was done in

00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:04,210
Brazil it was done in Argentina it was

00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,250
done somewhere in Europe and one of one

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,800
of my colleagues or some someone who's

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,270
helping us out with this said well we

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,150
tried to bring this over it's completely

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:16,990
free the only costs are the setup costs

00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,700
and integration costs and they had good

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,860
talks going on with the juvenile

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,770
Research Foundation which is one of the

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:27,820
big foundation that does clinical trials

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:29,500
in Canada and it went nowhere people sat

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:33,250
on it for about two years two to three

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,440
years four years nothing happened so if

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,050
not if the solution is not necessarily

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,120
better technology

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:42,150
could the problem over here is at the

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,150
about adoption and how do you how do you

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,039
necessarily solve adoption and one of

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,629
the ways you can solve adoption is with

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,210
critical mass and what I mean by

00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:54,060
critical mass is the press hold of new

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,580
software used by the users in the

00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,370
environment that are using it but a lot

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:02,940
faster not and for a very little cost

00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:04,500
and so what we're trying to do is you

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,780
get critical massive clinician starting

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,909
to use it to get a critical mass of

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,620
strategic partnership because as a small

00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:12,240
company in Canada you don't necessarily

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:17,060
have the credibility to push the product

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,139
through into the medical ecosystem and

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,449
there's a lot of other problems there

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,740
but basically critical masses build

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:24,810
something cheaper build something ugly

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,840
or build something stars but get it out

00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:29,729
there so now we have a goal for the

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,000
technology and the technology is speed

00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:37,949
and integration and that duct tape so

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,169
that's where poll comes in so what we've

00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,729
done so far are a bunch of pull pilots

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,310
where we just glued stuff together

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:46,919
really quickly so we have a modulus is

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:49,080
here could you be and react pilot that's

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,819
running at the cardiac pilot we have a

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,000
catalyst innovation for sqlite that's

00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,919
running as a radiology pilot then we

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,380
have a way in sainte jalle plus mode

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,770
delicious plus WebSocket thing that's a

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,479
data analysis pilot that's running then

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,759
we have something called 807 and 80

00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,919
someone with the standard for or

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,930
supposed to be the standard for how the

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,090
health care system and that is plugged

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,389
up with some very simple template x.x

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:17,580
late and that's another pilot and etc

00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:19,110
etc so the turnaround for each one of

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,300
these pilots is about two to four weeks

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,669
so what we do is when we first start out

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,409
and I had more slides on this but I'll

00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,479
just talk about it now what we do is

00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:30,300
when you first start out is we get

00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:32,579
basically simply the number of users

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,380
what the users what forms the users are

00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:36,390
filling out and at the end of the time

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,820
what type of data base have to need to

00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:43,620
plug into three things and we just go

00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:47,370
because in most of these cases the user

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:50,220
has never seen a good design for the

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,660
front end i sorry for any of my system

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,000
or

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,410
for any requisition software this is

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,510
never seen a good one so they don't know

00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,790
what they want and since they don't know

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,710
what we what we what they want we don't

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,360
know what we are going to build until we

00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,280
get into the third week and they say

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,700
well I'm trying it out and this doesn't

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,070
work for us so when we started most of

00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,800
the pilots we just started like a hard

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,800
part of whole bunch of random modules

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:20,030
that we are using and now we see the

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,860
result after 10 months of doing this

00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:27,450
yeah and after a lot of coffee we're

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:29,640
seeing that we have a sort of framework

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,890
that we can build around and that's

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,260
really what I wanted to get in today get

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,500
into today was about what I would

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,750
envision the framework would look like

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,220
so most of the most of the pilots that

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,690
start this have to start with a certain

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,340
amount of flexibility so that's why I'm

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,290
using stuff like reality many people

00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:51,750
don't know react until could do because

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:53,880
the DVR no escuro kind of story so you

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,160
can store like JSON objects using store

00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,080
simple text objects which can store data

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,720
and you can do an elastic search on it

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,030
and elastic circus goes really quickly

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,990
through the station object and its

00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:08,700
indexes it as you put it in so that's

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,870
where we're getting a lot of flexibility

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,160
in terms of the data because as I said

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,330
we don't know what the hell they want

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,640
they don't know what the hell they want

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,950
so what we do is we start out with very

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,570
simple rest api is connected up to

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,670
something that's very flexible data

00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,670
database why then we can change the json

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,980
objects as we go along and then the

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,690
javascript is only bottleneck at that

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,600
point where the javascript at the front

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:33,570
end and we change it as we go for how it

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,950
should react to the data so once we once

00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:42,720
we doing this and i can show an example

00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:50,660
of this um I should have had that

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:50,660
started up um so this is sorry

00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:58,160
so this is one of the catalyst

00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:25,600
applications based on sorry catalyst

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:40,670
with the reactor i start my reacting oh

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:47,120
ok ah hold on mix up here Oh a video in

00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:53,420
English working ok um should this

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:56,810
is a very quick mock-up this we've done

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,100
it about four to five weeks we'll do a

00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:05,320
little bit longer than most over turn

00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:05,320
around are you kidding me what

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:31,360
maybe I can just get internet try that

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:33,190
out oh great well imagine that there's a

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,200
very awesome looking stuff to going on

00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:46,600
there in the meantime I just run another

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:49,060
application this work so this is a

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:54,160
data analysis software with the java jar

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:58,170
file running in the background and it

00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,640
has a job runner that cause the java

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:10,330
back in a basically the air this

00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:11,530
application was made yeah so this

00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,510
application the way works it has a

00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,130
WebSocket front-end so teaching html5

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,960
it's very simple we've made really

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:20,290
quickly because the different the trial

00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,510
starting in about a couple weeks now and

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:25,120
we jumped on as basically looking at

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,880
convergence of correlations in the data

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,580
set so what happens is someone puts up a

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:35,260
CSV file and this year to file is

00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:38,230
basically basically a bunch of numbers

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:42,580
with the x and y data set so they upload

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:45,340
the CSV file and a golden ones along and

00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:50,140
when it starts and it should be going up

00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:51,940
what yeah so the job runner picks it up

00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,380
and it starts running actuator I start

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,720
running a java software for an hour

00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,750
statistics algorithm by running it

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,290
finished it finishes it off and it

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:05,470
builds it randomly pick status data out

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,810
of the out of the data so that was given

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,960
and it does the correlation strength of

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,490
it so this the the alternatives for

00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,220
doing this would be sitting there with

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,769
pen and paper and running linear

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,870
question running a whole bunch of other

00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:21,040
statistical measure across randomly

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:24,699
sampled data set but they're done

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,540
manually on real-time data the value of

00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:31,779
this is the CSV format is very simple

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:34,029
and most of the real time stuff can be

00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:35,199
captured in CSV format and we build

00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:36,610
another application application are

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:41,319
going to show you earlier what it does

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:45,670
it looks at what is critical medical

00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:46,930
information in in any given report so if

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,449
you have a if you have a if you're

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,339
coming in for knee surgery the doctor

00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:52,300
writes down your name which is not

00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:54,519
really important we don't hear about

00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,740
your age and hold on to other

00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:59,500
demographics then he writes down in free

00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,699
form what is wrong with you what were

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,889
the complications what were the

00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:05,199
treatment done to you and all that but

00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:07,120
in that free forum they have a mental

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,589
template that they go through saying

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,879
well I need to talk about this

00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:12,120
complication I in talk about that

00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:14,860
complication and that mental template

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,310
can be digitized at just a very HTML

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,750
form where they only enter the critical

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,309
medical information and then the next

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:25,300
thing that they do nothing that the

00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:27,850
software does it puts it into a free

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:31,059
format looking template so now things

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,500
are more standardized and already from

00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:35,170
the get-go things are separated out and

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,160
from that information we can do stuff

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,529
like this where we're looking at

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,110
correlation strength across a random

00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:42,779
sample so that five seconds of whatever

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:46,209
I did although it looks very simple

00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:49,569
that's about 12 to two years of work if

00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:51,100
you were doing it manually which sounds

00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:54,279
really because that's not

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:57,040
really mind bogglingly mind breaking

00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:59,730
stuff it's not really hard to make but

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,730
again going back to the adoption problem

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:05,139
it's not about better technology this if

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:09,309
you look at the code for they said crap

00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:12,220
it just looks good the adoption is the

00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:13,689
problem because the people who say it's

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,459
a good software are not necessarily

00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:16,720
people buying it so the clinicians are

00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:18,069
gonna end up going to use something like

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,079
this they can say yeah this is great

00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:22,209
blah blah blah but it's not up to us to

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,429
buy anything so now you're stuck in a

00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:26,380
kind of conundrum of how you can get

00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:28,410
stuff into the hospital even which opens

00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,490
yours even if an it's free

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:34,350
how do you get stuff into the hospital

00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:41,129
and that's that we're poor was one of

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:43,319
the reasons why we using it and and with

00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:45,629
that with over 10 months of work we

00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:47,250
started as i mentioned to the car yet

00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:52,589
pilots with finished we finished our

00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:57,000
reality requisition for Matt and I guess

00:16:52,589 --> 00:17:04,670
that's that flirting with it and i'll

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,670
take some question your maple shirt yeah

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:12,240
yeah that's kind of become with the idea

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:15,270
that they all do we have some of their

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,909
own do they say well we always gonna

00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,589
take my uncle people these ones which is

00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:23,459
fine for Ozzy just you don't we go order

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:26,669
when you certify the application but the

00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:29,850
waist dream I think that people want to

00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:32,070
do in which they well we're not

00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:34,559
necessarily your houses software with

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:36,090
but it opened stores and other people

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,760
know how to work and we're not come from

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,909
with that I like I don't know why is the

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,760
uncomfortable just because the source is

00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:46,260
open just to do know how to meet it and

00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,880
put someone else does they have a

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,710
certain amount of uncomfortable feeling

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,299
with that and it's something that we

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,049
were working around me is going to do it

00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:56,789
we're saying we have a dual life don't

00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:59,700
it's a basically saying that part of

00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:02,610
this code it slow until you accept to

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:06,450
open it so it works with so we work in

00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:08,760
conjunction with VIP partners from 0 to

00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,760
the hospital and saying okay if you do

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,110
want this application

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,470
what we were saying about Gemma dat

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:16,870
chant of 378 extent of your pseudo

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,460
engineering calc Berkeley what we did

00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,200
when we put it up on a releasable at

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,490
this point the server and then they can

00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,790
either on the iPad as you're walking

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:27,460
around in their own Department so we get

00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:29,410
a boat 70 80 some of them using it the

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,930
audience i forgot to do that we're

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,450
trying to do now different eating at

00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:38,050
evangelizing stuff and say well we have

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:41,110
all using it so it is you usually know

00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:44,170
this is not was money to say i'm at that

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:47,860
point in this system of nike stuff over

00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:51,130
to the administration and the people who

00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,780
sit on the boards at me and at that

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,940
point most of people on the board of

00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,680
people are immunity for free so it's

00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,500
become be easier to those but it's in a

00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,630
very complicated problems because stuff

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,310
what in a hospital go to run smoothly

00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,170
and people don't want to start that

00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:08,350
process that's awesome it's a pain in

00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:10,600
the ass when i simplify things as much

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,880
as possible but instead of going to be a

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,280
way out of that and that's what reasons

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,930
i won't start what you're hoping to

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,380
restrain was willing to build up the

00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:22,110
value for it even though technology is

00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,460
not the greatest in our dachshund

00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:29,720
criteria it couldn't be

00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:31,250
a hundred you thought I kind of went off

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,080
on you talk like you know but I hope

00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,080
that I was

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,660
critical now is trying to

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,670
everybody wants a nerd by using

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,670
and you

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:56,330
you don't have to test it up before and

00:19:54,169 --> 00:20:00,429
hair and when I mean what you said they

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,429
will come to me he loaded one something

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:08,840
they got all over to dr. unity and the

00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:13,309
document went up into that little well

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:17,840
yeah would you put viable collective and

00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:20,090
do that that has been successful but

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,450
that was the first time they ever tried

00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,890
it I don't clean up at it yet so we're

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,530
going to where you open book so we

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:32,600
thought well as you want in the hospital

00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:34,700
with that so we talked to so rather than

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:39,830
to talk to you pretty much any more okay

00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:43,070
and okay you know what saturday but then

00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:46,080
in the project of luna

00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:48,510
we started we can be started after the

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:53,870
fact of what we wanted to do but we

00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:56,550
start out simple just get this thing but

00:20:53,870 --> 00:21:00,630
again I domestically the law student was

00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:05,180
talking to me wrong go to survival suit

00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:05,180
me someone where the path of development

00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:18,040
pick a pretty ugly feet but if I can

00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:20,890
wake up in crack and only

00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,020
we're so what's your business with what

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,870
how do you get paid we get paper is

00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,640
connected and putting in a collateral

00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:36,800
Bernard

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:40,580
the Ferrari the next one in the hospital

00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,350
for pretty much the same stuff generous

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:49,059
that we selling it wouldn't you add

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:49,059
heart and that's that prima physically

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,090
right

00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,760
PFE

00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,650
I think

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,630
really

00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:49,280
but the other thing I know it did that

00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,280
although

00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,750
when we start out

00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,950
definitively well if you want the

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,900
software you 15 with the building and

00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,140
that's enough come from why other

00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,200
zombies

00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,200
I

00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:14,429
and to what would you have how to do it

00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:17,779
and we'll be looking them now and then

00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:17,779
you certify it once you get

00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,260
but a dimension

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:37,100
they did not make me and off of what we

00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:37,100
acted in just about building

00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:14,780
Oh

00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:19,580
10 20 10 to 11 months right now we've

00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:23,110
got it we just started like last August

00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:31,220
right after Yap see 2009 pretty much

00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:33,020
we're coming the adoption the adoption

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,580
gonna be the biggest cookie the adoption

00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,820
that I talked about adoption of the

00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:39,020
software he probably the biggest Calvin

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,030
could it not necessarily a software

00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:45,169
problem the software is a key component

00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:46,700
what it the political there is you know

00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:49,940
economical there's a whole bunch of

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:53,840
different things going on there got a

00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:57,440
really hard to get around and I don't

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,669
know if you can I'm I'm confident that

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,220
we're trying to do the best thing that

00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:03,260
we can do now but only in hindsight I

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,909
can I tell you like you know I p 110

00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:09,549
pounds and that always was over good

00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:09,549
while doing what we did over yeah

00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
