a seep an app for browsing the this

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:09,500
Sipan the comprehensive parole archive

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,639
network and I didn't find anything and

00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,490
so I thought well I want to learn

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,770
android and this would be fun sort of

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,949
thing to do and medicine pan exists now

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,990
so maybe I'll give it a try so I put

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:28,680
this together and I have published it

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:32,840
it's on the Google not market not

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,840
android market the google play store

00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:48,570
that it costs 299 you can buy it in

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:50,399
almost every rabbit taiwan google does

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,930
not sell in taiwan because taiwan has a

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,610
legislated require legislative

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,610
requirement of a seven day return policy

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,480
that google refuses to adhere to the

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,219
itunes store happily goes sure whatever

00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:11,760
and they don't have a return policy at

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:14,220
all anywhere else i was going to have a

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,400
check here to give to somebody from the

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:21,240
pearl foundation and since I give all

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,810
the money that is earned to them but I

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,369
don't have my checkbook with me so I owe

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,700
them forty eight dollars and thirty four

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:32,280
cents and I'm hoping a few more people

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,210
will buy after seeing this talk so next

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,979
month I'll have a little more on the

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:42,329
payout the other is it's also open

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:48,360
source so if you'd like to give Android

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:50,909
a try it's there it's a built as an

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,380
eclipse project you might have to set up

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,670
some things about your environment a

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,380
little weird because some of its

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,610
tailored to kind of my development

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:02,070
environment right now because I'm the

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,869
only developer but you could download it

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,570
and build it and install it without

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:10,009
having to pay 299 if you wanted to do

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,110
that and you should go give your 299 or

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,670
more to the pro foundation while you're

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,970
at it

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,920
and that's what it looks like it's very

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:26,849
exciting that's pretty much the whole

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,849
app this is a picture of it on a tablet

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:39,519
I didn't take a new screenshot so this

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,290
shows the tablet version it works just

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,720
fine on a phone on a phone you would

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:47,170
only see the sidebar and then you do a

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,420
search and then it would if you clicked

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,180
on an item it would show you the pod so

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:55,680
it loads right now it does just

00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:58,900
searching modules it will show you and

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,560
you know the titles the author's the

00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,409
release information the ratings the

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,540
favorites and then if you click on it it

00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:09,459
shows the pod it does not do some other

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,069
things which I'd like it to do like you

00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:14,680
can't view release information like if

00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:17,620
you clicked on that header up there I

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,930
would like it to take you to here's all

00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,730
the other modules in this release here's

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,500
a list of other releases you can go look

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,250
at the documentation for each of those

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,389
releases and that it doesn't do I would

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,129
like you to be able to click on the

00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:31,480
gravitas and see the author's

00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:37,000
information and see all of their

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:42,040
releases I would like you to be able to

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,349
see this yellow or orange button

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,930
highlighted in blue if you had actually

00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:49,269
favorited them and then be able to tap

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,269
on that button and favorite it or

00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,650
unfavorite it yourself I would like you

00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:57,220
to be able to click on the ratings and

00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:00,129
go to the cpn rating site all these

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,709
things but they take time and I've spent

00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,729
the last a little while trying to fix

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,530
this so that I wouldn't be embarrassed

00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:09,609
to show you for you guys to look at my

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:14,829
code when I got to the talk so how does

00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:17,380
it work it works using mad asleep and I

00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:20,280
get a round of applause for the guys who

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,280
did made a seat man

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:27,699
I'm really happy about about that and

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:31,419
we've been talking about i remember a

00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:33,940
few years back pet dance Andy Lester

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:36,430
raising some issues about well you know

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,199
Sipan search see pants kind of stale

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,720
it's really proprietary we'd like to

00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,539
have something else and the guys came

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,949
along with meta Sipan sort of have taken

00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:46,720
it and run with it and they've made it

00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:49,479
so that not only do they have a great

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,900
search application but they made it so

00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:57,849
that sorry and there's a an API

00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,729
underneath it so anybody else can make

00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:03,039
their own competing application really

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:05,050
or you can do a tablet app or a phone

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,009
app or a you know blackberry app if

00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:17,889
you're really into dying technologies

00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:20,259
something but how does it work how do I

00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:24,130
get it to go well there's this

00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:27,760
documentation out there on github on how

00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:34,630
to use the API and i found it a little

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:40,630
helpful kind of get me started but not

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:42,490
really helpful like not hardly at all

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:51,849
helpful actually let's just be honest

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:56,680
and it it it's just it's just there to

00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:58,389
sort of say here it is and it's the API

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,250
itself is really this thing called

00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:06,789
elastic search under the hood which is

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:08,710
actually Java but it it it doesn't have

00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:10,210
any I mean it has some documentation but

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,659
I didn't really find it to be all that

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:15,849
helpful either and it's really geared

00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:19,150
towards you know you sort of using their

00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:22,360
API in Java and I have this rest client

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,039
thing that is added on to it but yeah

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,259
you can't release it now cool thing is

00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:27,789
it's androids and Java I thought hey

00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:30,760
cool you know maybe I could use the

00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:32,639
elastic path API to do some stuff no we

00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,150
can't because the

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,770
it expects to work with the elastic

00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,330
search server directly not with the rest

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,379
api and they don't have a rest api in

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,949
java they have a for several other

00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:46,050
languages Minaj java there's also this

00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:48,449
which is linked from there and this is

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,879
really cool it's kind of fun to play

00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:54,360
with you can go ahead and if you

00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,310
understand what any of that means you

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,249
can go and write some queries and try

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:01,169
out some things and they have some nice

00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:06,659
predefined queries on that this is

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:08,279
Explorer was it Explorer yeah that but

00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,800
it's it's this link here that med asleep

00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,719
an explorer link at the top looks like

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,469
explore dot meta CP and order something

00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:19,460
like that and you know this is a nifty

00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:22,409
little you know JavaScript app that

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,139
queries the API and then gives you back

00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:26,250
the response in JSON just so you can

00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,349
sort of play with it see what it does

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,969
I've used this to help I use this to

00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:32,189
help me get started and figure out what

00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:33,449
some of these things do and but it took

00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:35,520
some playing with to figure out all the

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,680
details but honestly it's still didn't

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,939
tell me what I want needed to know to

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:52,129
get my own medicine style application

00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:52,129
going alright so I'm not

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,750
he's a really good guy I've really liked

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:25,750
him he's still a good guy oh yeah

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:55,810
so awesomely all of meta Sipan is also

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:59,990
open source and i can read the code and

00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:02,540
that is the secret and he's japanese has

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,040
a great accent and it was it was more

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:08,750
fun to hear him say he would jump up and

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:13,760
down you must read the cold you know so

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:16,100
yes you must read the code to understand

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,020
how to do medicine man so I went in and

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,279
I looked through this is actually

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,410
probably the most important one for

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,300
module search you can read through what

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,130
it does and it looks something like this

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,120
here's just a little snippet i'm not

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,650
going to show you the whole thing it's

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,600
kind of long and drawn out and there are

00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,730
lots of function calls going on in here

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,320
well you know what that looks an awful

00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,800
lot like they're building some sort of

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,420
JSON and that is their building JSON so

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,730
I watch what they did and how they did

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:45,770
it and figure out that that maps into

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:49,250
about this in JSON and so now I just got

00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:55,089
to get that into my java well building

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:55,089
JSON and Java is hard it's really hard

00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,080
have you ever tried to build an object

00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,459
in Java and then build and fill it with

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,110
more objects and then fill it with more

00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:06,860
objects and the fill it one more objects

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:13,220
it's like why would you do that why did

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:15,470
they write it that way it's insane so I

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:20,860
built a little micro templating language

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:25,279
instead so I write JSON with j song and

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:28,070
then I fill in little bits so I trade it

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:31,250
like a string and then fill in bits with

00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,870
more stuff so I start with the template

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:36,620
that looks like this I've snipped out

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,300
all of the extra verbiage and just so we

00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:44,410
can focus on it you can see these little

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:47,020
percent notations for interpolation and

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:50,890
I picked that because

00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:53,430
I don't know I just did I didn't forget

00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:56,560
to use percent signs in my JSON I guess

00:10:53,430 --> 00:11:00,010
if I ever do then maybe I'll do the

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,370
bracket percent I don't know and then

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:08,320
the the little bar s just gives it a

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:11,770
format so we have bar s string gets

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,470
escaped or bar J which is raw JSON value

00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,940
which might actually be a JSON fragment

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,480
which two strings itself to the right

00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:21,310
thing which was useful in cases so you

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,800
saw in that original slide they had some

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,450
function calls going on and turns out

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,980
it's really handy to have some objects

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,990
that can generate their own JSON for you

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,000
and inject them into the into the

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,980
template in the right way that's kind of

00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,040
what we did so you can see on here the

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,840
the size is an integer so we don't

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,870
really need to escape anything the query

00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,480
string up there needs to be cleaned up

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,530
the clean queries the same thing and if

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,750
you read through the code you'll see

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:49,140
that they take the string your type and

00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,940
they clean it up just a tiny bit more

00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:54,220
for that one and I don't know I honestly

00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,230
don't even know why I'm on a lot of this

00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,300
i know i actually have learned a lot

00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,740
about how elastic search queries worked

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,690
as I went through it there's a lot

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,790
there's a lot there and it's really cool

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,070
I mean it's really flexible you can make

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:09,460
some really nice queries but I don't

00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,960
understand and like some of the lot of

00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,240
the policy decisions that went into the

00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,960
meta Sipan team but fortunately they've

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,810
made them and I don't have to know why

00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,890
they made them I just have to copy them

00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:25,030
that's a great thing about open source

00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,560
and another thing that that you have to

00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,880
worry about doing this so the other

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,550
thing I pulled from it is that there's

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,350
actually about for queries that have to

00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:36,960
run each time you do a module search on

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:39,460
Sipan and okay I got three minutes

00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,720
there's a you search for you can you

00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,910
have to search for the module so the

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,830
keyword search is what what that was and

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,630
then there's these other three searches

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:50,410
there's you have to find the author

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,760
gravatar URLs and because that's not

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:55,480
included in what's returned from the

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,790
module information and you have to get

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,250
that you have to do another query on the

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,800
favorites collection to get the list of

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,070
favorites

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,360
you know who's favourited everything how

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,610
many favorites there are for each thing

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,050
and then Sipan ratings so you can get

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,480
the the list of rating so they've got

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:13,220
these these are each and you know four

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,680
different indexes modules authors

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,050
favorites and ratings and after grab

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,399
each and then off of Sipan if you want

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:23,740
to show the gravatar is you have to go

00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:26,450
and of course fetch those from gravatar

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:31,910
so if you want to build your own

00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:36,140
medicine a plication on android you

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:38,990
install eclipse or whatever you install

00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:48,230
you set up the android sdk learn how to

00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:49,820
program java and android and you're

00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,890
going to have to understand concurrency

00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,920
or your apps going to be so slow no one

00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:58,610
will ever want to use it and concurrency

00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:03,050
and java is also hard and android has

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:06,890
some tools that make it easier but they

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:09,500
don't you have to learn how to build a

00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:12,470
UI which is really hard for probably

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,930
most of us in here you need to hire your

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:24,980
sister or your brother to make you a

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:30,920
logo yep set up a Google Play is it

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:33,260
market or store and play that yeah I

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,180
know but is it but Google Play is not a

00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,430
not a place you buy things Google Play

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:43,250
is like an action you take it play is

00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:45,440
not a noun Google Play yep set up

00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,209
account it costs twenty-five dollars to

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:52,970
start just to keep the spammers out I

00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:54,709
guess and yadda yadda yadda profit or

00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:59,810
donate your profits to the appropriate

00:14:54,709 --> 00:15:03,070
charity or you can foresee pan sidekick

00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,070
patches are welcome

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:26,050
questions now you download the one you

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,480
download the regular one the regular one

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,370
for java and then you go to Android's

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,250
website and they tell you where you to

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,510
find you have to do their update and you

00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,190
set up an update site and then you

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,200
download the rest of the stuff and it is

00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,720
and if you do that it installs all the

00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,630
SDK for you because it well it gives you

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:50,710
an up little tool that manages the SDK

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:53,320
and installs the SDKs for you I have

00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:56,040
considered it i have not seriously

00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,040
pursued it

00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:31,440
yeah yeah there's SL for a and it sort

00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:33,210
of works well and that that maybe

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,950
something would go to if nothing else I

00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,240
mean it could be a nice way of being

00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,340
able to have like a little sandbox where

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,630
you can run Perl code inside of you know

00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:45,420
or something but I'm probably not going

00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:47,640
to write an app in Java that call in

00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:58,650
Perl that calls Java it's just that's

00:16:47,640 --> 00:17:00,630
probably just not gonna happen I don't

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:07,910
know that it's that valuable it's just

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:21,050
it's like Hello where'd it go I earth

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:26,030
solar system thingy it's did it not big

00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:26,030
and it's not very robust either

00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:32,900
no that's true that's true it could it

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,760
could be but like what i'm going to do

00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,040
put it on may vendors I mean it's

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,830
there's just there's no equivalent it's

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,530
easy to distribute play in Java I'll

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:58,880
just put if anything you can just fork

00:17:42,530 --> 00:18:00,290
it from there who know yeah I do HTML at

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,120
work all day I don't want to do it

00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,410
anymore and that's part of the reason i

00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:17,720
was looking into this because i really

00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:21,230
hate web programming yeah i think you

00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,810
can I'd have not tried it and there have

00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:27,200
been a few projects to do it msl for a

00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:31,400
is probably the most the one that works

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:34,400
best now SL for a scripting languages

00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:44,380
it's also this also Python and Ruby and

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:44,380
I think even PHP yeah karthik oh sorry

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:54,210
if I search for something on my android

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,830
phone and I find what I want that I in

00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,669
order to be able to do something with

00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,669
the module video

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,330
no that would be a good feature though

00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,980
having a share you can there's a

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,390
standard sharing widget thing you can

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,380
put in and that would probably be the

00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:23,060
way to do it because then you could just

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:25,620
say share it on something else I mean I

00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:28,350
don't know if there was a way I mean it

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,480
make it a favorite if we ever had that

00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:33,660
if I can get that I don't know how to do

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,610
the UI their user logging in stuff is is

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:51,510
the the challenge on their I don't know

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:52,620
how to do that from a nap yeah you can

00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,030
get you can get the dot all the

00:19:52,620 --> 00:20:01,650
documentation as HTML meta CP an API

00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:03,000
yeah yes as rod pas to that and one

00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,380
thing I would like to do is have it so

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,330
that you could have an offline mode and

00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,360
then you could just keep you know say

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,460
all of your favorites on my tablet which

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:17,580
doesn't have Wi-Fi most places I go lots

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:19,440
on my house so all right well I'm

00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,440
already way late so if you guys have

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,430
another talk to go to in another room

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,430
