it's all the way over there

00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:41,120
should I start or okay okay okay

00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,520
so this lightning talk is about a

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,350
hackathon that the Ã¶zil OPM guys are

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,059
organizing in and I'm gonna butcher the

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,640
names of all the places in when I

00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:51,500
mention them in stopping dirt I think is

00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,750
how you say stopping go thank you

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,780
Norway and it's the 25th of August

00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:02,380
through the 30th of August okay for

00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,380
those of us in for our EU people it's

00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,060
awesome Americans have a little bit more

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,729
of an excuse but still that fits on a

00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:16,990
slide so you should be able to get there

00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:16,990
the Brazilians maybe have a little bit

00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,729
it's gonna be taking place at the end

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,070
can you please help me with

00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:27,070
pronunciation on this one Frank is

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:31,850
stolen the prek is stolen Mountain Lodge

00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:34,600
so in beautiful practiced alone here

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,799
okay so we're also hopefully planning

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,380
weather permitting and I'm sure I mean

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,549
Norway in August it's gotta be nice

00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,770
weather permitting a hike it's a five

00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:44,710
kilo meter walk from the lodge so here

00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,540
this pulpit rock beautiful beautiful

00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,640
view and we can potentially throw Python

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,850
programmers off the edge or something I

00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,960
mean whatever you want to do so it's a

00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:59,000
it's a dual dual subject hackathon the

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,159
one of the first things is the RDF

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,390
modules ok so there's been a lot of

00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,430
discussion they already have community

00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,869
about moving these modules over to moose

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,630
and sort of taking advantage of some of

00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:09,799
the meta layer features that moose has

00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:12,530
so there's really there's two goals for

00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:14,750
the hackathon one is to react attacked

00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,320
already of trying and rdf query to use

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,820
moose and then another one to build more

00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,000
of an automated system to take rdf

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,410
semantics over and bind them with the

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,360
moose in the mop so if you're interested

00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,560
in rdf or the semantic web or anything

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,660
like that

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:36,760
come along and again see beautiful view

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,760
beautiful and again beautiful view again

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:44,590
okay you don't get stuff like that in

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:48,320
the States come on guys the second

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:50,870
second topic is so I've been working on

00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,720
a project to try and get the get a mop

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,330
into the profile core I'm not gonna

00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,290
promise a date on that at all Christmas

00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:01,430
Easter sometime around there so part of

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,000
the hackathon is gonna be about that

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,160
we've got a couple a couple agendas for

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,170
that more tests okay so the idea is

00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,460
we're going to write this prototype

00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,630
we're going to write a lot of tests for

00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,250
it and those tests will just only go

00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,050
back into the core so help to make sure

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,840
that it's it's a it's a solidly tested

00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,640
piece before it makes it into core roles

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,770
we're still working on the low level

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,690
design of roles in the meta object

00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:27,200
system so if that interest you in any

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,960
way come and hack with us the docs need

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,150
updating as Dave role ski can attest to

00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,030
I'm a horrible speller my grammar is bad

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,560
and I really should never write Docs so

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,700
anybody wants to come and help you know

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,960
spellcheck my stuff add to it that great

00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,400
integration with pro core so anybody

00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,890
familiar with the pro core please come

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,090
okay because you know that's one thing

00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,440
I'm not necessarily familiar with and

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,060
the more we know about it and the more

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,650
we're doing this from an informed point

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,660
of view the more possibility of success

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,070
we have and then of course integration

00:03:53,660 --> 00:04:00,050
with Perl 6 I think Patrick you're else

00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:03,470
are you for sure coming ok guilt Patrick

00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,700
into coming please okay but Jonathan

00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,410
we're thinking is coming so we want to

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,570
make sure that you know again we're

00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,730
trying to get something that will work

00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:13,760
as well with pro/5 and and hopefully

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,100
bridge to Perl 6 and anything really

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,690
moose related it's open so if you have a

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,950
module or something like that you want

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,650
to move to moose and you want to get

00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:25,330
other people doing it come to Norway

00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,330
because you can't do that from home

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,570
so here's a couple important dates and I

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,970
know this is running a little late but

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,070
June 25th is the deadline after that

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,800
they need to know they need to tell the

00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,740
lodge on June 25th or actually June 26

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,870
that the number of people that they have

00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,640
so if you want to do it that's an

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,740
important date okay

00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,270
there is again there's a limited space

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,060
and stuff like that but we do still have

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:52,160
some space Saturday we're all sort of

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,900
making our way to that so this is Rexy

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,280
right after you have CEU so if you're

00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,600
going the FCU and you happen to be on

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,850
the other side of Atlantic already maybe

00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,370
just take a couple extra days and then

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:04,430
the hackathon and then if weather allows

00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,470
to the visit to practice stolen and then

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:10,970
the 30th we all clear up and go home

00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:13,700
so if you interested the oslo PM channel

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,890
on IRC tup probe org talk to the people

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,960
there remember June 25th is the deadline

00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:28,280
and we're also in the Yaak is the act

00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:30,020
system so what I just finished yeah be

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,560
also if you go there and they won't tell

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,920
you anything

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,880
Oslo sorry yeah exactly it's a spelling

00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,880
Dave you know how it goes

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:56,710
and do it and all right thank you and

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,750
come see me to win I think we do have

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,210
some community they do have some money

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,590
for community sponsorship too so if

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,270
you're really truly interested in it

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,380
come talk to me and we can we can talk

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,540
to the guys and see what money's left

00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:39,190
and get you over there and help pay for

00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:43,450
some of the costs as well for a Chanel

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:46,060
and humbling experience and I just want

00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:48,880
to thank my company Pythian for making

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,940
this happening they sponsored me to come

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,650
here and was great and I just wanted to

00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,960
mention that they're looking for Pearl

00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:58,810
developers they're based in Ottawa

00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,540
Ontario Canada and they're basically a

00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,640
database workshop and operating globally

00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,260
throughout the world so if anybody is

00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,860
interested one point of time coming

00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,380
douwe it's a great city very beautiful

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:15,780
yeah find me out or if I'm picking

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,780
online and thank you

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,880
get everyone this is in some ways a

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,120
follow up to trends keynote but a much

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,160
much shorter version so the people who

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,970
use pol chuan said and I'm going to tell

00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,530
you as well I'm not entirely like us not

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:42,050
entirely like the people who are in this

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:45,139
room deaf c99 said a view of what we

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,210
were but I'm gonna ask for hands up if

00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:48,860
you do not feel comfortable raising your

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,410
hand even if you fit into the

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,210
demographic so I asked just keep it down

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:59,090
I don't mind hands up for those who are

00:07:53,210 --> 00:08:06,020
women around okay hands up if you

00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:15,110
identify as non-white okay what if

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:20,080
you're young what if you under 35 okay

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,080
what you primarily develop under windows

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:31,099
no booing no not allowed the pillar of

00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:33,589
community is not the same as all the

00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:36,529
users of Perl each one gave us this

00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:38,360
excellent visualization there are a lot

00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:42,229
more groups of people who are using Perl

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,789
yes Noreen created this there are a lot

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,790
more users of Perl than the people who

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:49,010
turn up to these conferences now I do

00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,839
training my job is to teach new people

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,520
Perl and there were a number of other

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:53,899
trainers in this audience that I've

00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,820
spoken to over the course of this week

00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:57,740
in generating the numbers they give you

00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,010
on the side these are somewhat got

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,270
feelings none of us have gone and done

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:04,370
demographic surveys of our students but

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,529
we have been doing this for years so we

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,270
have a good feeling for these numbers

00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:11,180
and what the first question I said once

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,800
you conversion rate to a community hey

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,020
students come along to Melbourne Perl

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,480
mungus or Sydney Perl mongers I try to

00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:20,140
get them up to come along it's probably

00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,540
a lot lower than even you would hope

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:25,490
these people just want to do Perl for

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,900
their jobs these are people I'm think

00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,640
this is why they're not in this room

00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,520
this is why our demographics are

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,080
different

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:37,390
it makes me angry anyway so again this

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,610
is primarily from training in a strap

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:42,460
but I have spoken to the trainer's in

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,100
this conference area and what figures

00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,990
for elsewhere as well so let's have a

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,450
look at the paid kinds of things numbers

00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,040
I'm seeing what do you think is the

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,470
ratio between men and women would be

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,560
Shuang gave you a number and it's about

00:09:53,470 --> 00:10:00,190
right about 20% of my course attendees

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,970
are women as you noticed we sort of

00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:08,230
didn't quite get that white Fez is not

00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:10,870
like up to about 30% not so much in my

00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:13,090
course courses in Australia but with the

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,810
discussions of the other trainers 30% is

00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:22,620
not an unreasonable number awesome again

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:26,170
not something we're reflecting here H

00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:30,130
most of my students are young in fact

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:33,310
and I mean this sort of makes sense in

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:36,820
many ways but my typical ages are

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:39,010
between 25 and 35 they're at a

00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,960
university they're maybe into their

00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:45,940
first or second job now the learning

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:48,640
Perl this one this is what started the

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,160
cut the dis lightning talk because I'm I

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,250
brought this up every single time I

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,230
start a training course I say who

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,660
amongst you intend to primarily develop

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,640
under Windows they put the hands up who

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,990
primarily intend to develop under

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,180
something like there's some UNIX kind of

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:09,850
operating system they put their hands up

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:11,980
and it's 5050 and the other trainers

00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:15,090
said so - except for the trainer who

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,090
refuses to trade under windows

00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:23,970
so for all of those people who think

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:27,630
Perl is just a UNIX thing get over and

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:51,600
stop boo hissing windows because we I'm

00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:53,880
not just Perl thank you well thanks a

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,520
lot for the the white camel thing I'm

00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,070
I'm guru by the way hi nice to meet you

00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:02,370
I want to invite everybody to Yap see

00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:05,360
Brazil I mean we're not as fancy as as

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:08,730
this I mean this is totally awesome but

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,430
we try our best and we are very friendly

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:13,080
and if you can make it it will be

00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:17,280
awesome and we'll be delighted to have

00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:20,910
you so thank you Oh Cho by 19 this year

00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,560
every year is about late October early

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,050
November so even if you can't make it

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,020
this year make sure you book it for next

00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,460
year or the year after and well we'll be

00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,729
delighted to have you thank you

00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,729
[Music]

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,400
hey my name is Mike Melina and I'm a web

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,080
developer which is pretty awesome

00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,230
because I get to build cool things in

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,180
Perl all day long but it's less awesome

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,780
because once I'm done I have to prove

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,550
that it works and the industries that I

00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,660
work in are very big on formal

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,880
acceptance testing

00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,350
I'm sure that's karma paying me back for

00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,340
something awful I did in the past life

00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:01,980
and it's just not a lot of fun I wound

00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:04,590
up writing hundreds of pages of plain

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,360
English test plans verifying every and

00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:09,720
name detail of what the application does

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,690
I write selenium tests to verify the

00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,150
behavior of the application I send these

00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,560
test plans to my QA guy who runs through

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,330
them for hours and then sends me emails

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,810
letting me know that the corners are not

00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,400
rounded and ie and I've performed the

00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,560
acceptance test with the client which is

00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,330
their opportunity to ignore the 100 page

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,770
test plan and let me know about all the

00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:35,790
features they wanted that are not in the

00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:36,990
spec and this works pretty well you know

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,660
people have been doing it for a long

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,790
time but it takes a lot of time cost me

00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:45,420
a lot of money and unlike writing

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:47,220
software it's just not awesome so I do

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,810
some contract work for a grant Street

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,600
group and I was gripping to them about

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:53,220
this and they told me you got to check

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,590
out this application that we're working

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,900
on I checked it out actually worked on

00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,780
it a little bit and it's pretty cool

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,870
it's called testify it's a web

00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:05,370
application test automation framework

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,830
lets you write self documenting plain

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:10,590
English text has a native perl client

00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:14,400
that spits out beautiful tap output and

00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:15,900
it lets you get screenshots this is all

00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,090
within your plain English test

00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:21,120
documentation that at least in my case I

00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:24,810
got it right anyways so it allows me to

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,510
take these inane one-off tasks that are

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:29,160
very time-consuming and essentially just

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,690
replace them with a linear set of tasks

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,480
that all revolve around the plain

00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:35,190
English documentation so I go from for a

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,310
small project about 40 hours of

00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:41,600
acceptance testing effort to about 10

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,600
hours which is pretty good

00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:50,910
so I have just for the hell of it I

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,400
wrote a little domain name management

00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,410
platform it has questionable features

00:14:53,400 --> 00:15:00,270
like recommending silly domain names for

00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:02,580
you to register and about 15 20 minutes

00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:05,190
ago I wrote a little test to verify some

00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,710
of the input validation shall run right

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:11,760
now and I don't know if you can see this

00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:13,770
too well on the screen I have my plain

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,860
English text right here go to the URL

00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:19,770
click a link fill out a form verify that

00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:23,130
an error message shows up and a couple

00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:25,770
times I tell it to take a screenshot so

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,480
my scripts running here it's going to

00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,400
keep me apprised of the status of course

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,290
with the API you can always run a test

00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:45,360
get an ID back and come back and pick it

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:47,880
up later that's a feature yeah it was

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,740
just that with MST toning down as

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:59,550
language I figured I had to contribute

00:15:49,740 --> 00:16:03,480
you know yep so I get my tap output here

00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:05,730
lets me know all my tests passed and if

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:09,060
I go onto the website I get my test

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:13,140
results here and I can click a link see

00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:15,780
the screenshots it's pretty neat it's in

00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,990
beta right now and in beta it is free

00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:20,520
testify comm slash Yap see you have any

00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,630
questions for ask the Grand Street guys

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,020
they're the ones who are constantly

00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:27,260
telling you they're hiring and my own

00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:29,640
pitch check out domain crate comm it's

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,500
domain registration so it still sucks

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:36,660
but it sucks lastly thanks

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:39,490
[Applause]

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,230
hi Amanda Schwartz you probably know me

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,310
from my books and floss weekly things

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,590
like that but one of the other hats that

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:47,290
I wear is Linux fundador I'm on the

00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,660
board of Linux funded org we make money

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,430
by direct donations for 501c3 we also

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,930
get make money by people carrying around

00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,550
a credit card with a penguin on it and

00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,050
using it in everyday transactions we get

00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,610
some of the philippe's for that we're

00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:00,010
trying to give away a couple thousand

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,750
bucks a month really low overhead just

00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,040
sent a piece of email to us and say what

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,600
you want the thousand dollars of two

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,560
thousand dollars to do we're just trying

00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,449
to give it away we don't have enough

00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:11,470
people to give it away to so please come

00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:13,209
do that and also we own open or give the

00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,790
domain don't ask how we got it we have

00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:16,959
that we haven't figured out exactly what

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,850
to do with the answer if you have ideas

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,290
suggestions although that's gonna open a

00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,850
bike Shannon you already know but anyway

00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,380
let's say where you can do with that cuz

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,449
I really it's just been parked for a

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:38,980
year we don't have to do with it so let

00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:41,590
me know thanks hello

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,760
well I set up I am Kristin Aaron operon

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,520
going to be talking about something

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:49,000
called T MUX which you might be familiar

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,000
with if as being compared to a new

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,570
screen and the idea with T MUX is that

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,700
it is more minimal but more flexible at

00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:02,770
the same time it is something newer

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:06,310
based on well using the lib event C

00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:08,470
library for doing all the input IO and

00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:12,160
that kind of thing and it has some cool

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:15,580
features that have made doing work for

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,650
me as a UNIX loving system and developer

00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,270
type thing rather easy and once this

00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:24,900
thing decides to actually work I'll try

00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:27,550
to show it to you okay so here we go

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,290
right so we start a new session this is

00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:32,760
pretty easy you know that kind of thing

00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:36,160
one of the really simplest things that

00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:39,070
that T MUX does that kanou screen has

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,900
difficulty with is doing different kinds

00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:45,210
of splits like this or doing different

00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,970
arrangements of windows like the

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:51,899
this is uh all the different presets

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:55,110
there are also ways to interact with

00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:57,779
it's in the command line so I remember

00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:15,330
the commands correctly what does that

00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:16,830
say there we go so we could do this you

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,980
can do that you know and it's not

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:21,390
actually crashing which is yeah I've use

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,960
an experimental thing for doing splits

00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:27,570
on T MUX and or excuse me on screen an

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,809
tend to crash a lot but there's this in

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:33,510
its it supports it more natively so the

00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:34,740
idea is that since it's build in a few

00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,500
months it supports it but there's also

00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:42,149
more interesting things like the ability

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:44,039
to move a pain from one team accession

00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:45,480
to another like say for example you

00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:48,120
wanted to change your cell config and

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,100
all your shells right so but you have

00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,080
this mercy session that's been up for

00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,760
200 days and you'd feel really really

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,409
really sad if you had to quit the thing

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,990
and then you'd have to configure all

00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:59,399
your channels even the adult channels

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,200
Ilyas sometimes work sometimes doesn't

00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,460
but whatever maybe you forgot to add the

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,840
network therefore the new client you're

00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,710
contracting with whatever you wanted to

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,750
move the irsie session to a new team lux

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:16,909
you can do that with the move aim

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:16,909
command what that does is team X what

00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:29,049
no no no I'm sure this works yeah yeah

00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:32,820
we should doing a live demo and of

00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:35,700
course it is falling over horribly yes

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:40,540
[Music]

00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:42,100
no no move window okay there you go you

00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,870
can't well okay there's a concept of

00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,400
pain which is the three things that you

00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,799
see up here there's a concept of window

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,750
which is the collection of three panes

00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:52,900
that you see here so basically I have my

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,880
team ups in pain the pain was yok

00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,559
playing the whole window so I wanted to

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,200
move that to a new team exchange a new

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:04,120
team accession so I used the move window

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,830
command to move the window on the Linode

00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,480
with the earth see when is it awesome by

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,440
the way

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,990
they are not paying me to say that I

00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,120
moved the earth see session from this

00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,010
from that old session to the new one and

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,720
so I'm still up on IRC after 200 less

00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:19,660
days um that it's just something that

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,809
team Lux does it's also useful for say

00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:25,150
you start a a command you wanted to let

00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:26,559
me do this it does D caching and it does

00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:33,490
reconnecting that kind of thing and

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:35,740
there's also things like thank-you show

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:39,760
and that kind of thing which you can do

00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:41,500
T MUX sit in someone's ringing it's not

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:48,760
me

00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:50,710
yes so you can yes yes you can do set

00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:55,030
ends and show em that kind of thing

00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:56,620
which is useful for fixing the problem

00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,809
the common problem whereby if you

00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,580
reconnect to a team accession your

00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:03,100
secure shell agent will be falling over

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:06,580
the idea here is that you can use this

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:08,740
in tandem with a quick simple shell

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,809
scripts which will take the environment

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,460
variable for team ops which is separate

00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:14,169
from your shell and then you can put it

00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,120
into your shell by looking at the team

00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:18,250
Oakes environment variable from within

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,070
team us and therefore fix your secure

00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,620
shell agent or your GPG agent GPG sucks

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:26,140
by the way yes so that's that's really

00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:28,600
the quickest simplest thing that can go

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,500
over in about five minutes so thank you

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,310
do try it

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,290
it's

00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:39,280
open source and all that good stuff so

00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:41,080
there you go thank you so real quick I'm

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,670
James like a lot of other guys who are

00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,530
doing the one-minute thing this is my

00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,060
first Yap see I'm really excited to have

00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,220
come here if you'd asked me a month ago

00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,780
what I thought about pearl I think like

00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,790
a lot of people who are probably not in

00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,960
this room they would have said people

00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:58,750
still use that and I am really

00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,070
incredibly encouraged by everything that

00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:03,100
I've learned this weekend I feel like I

00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:04,810
learned a lot you guys the people in

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,390
this room have put together a pearl

00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:09,610
Renaissance in the last two to three

00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:12,160
years as nearly as I can tell where 10

00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,780
years ago the the questions of stagnancy

00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,490
were serious ones and you guys have

00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,610
overcome it and that's fantastic and I'm

00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:20,650
really excited to be coming back to

00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:23,170
parole after so long away that having

00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:25,030
been said if you're not taking off

00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,800
tonight and you're going to be around

00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,180
tomorrow morning I want to go run by the

00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,490
lake who wants to go run by the lake

00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,260
let's go run by the lake we'll go

00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:34,750
running by the lake in the morning it'll

00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:38,790
be cool just if you want to go come find

00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,790
me afterwards it'll be it'll be fun

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:50,190
so hi I'm Jean hack I'm gonna talk about

00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,150
hide

00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:56,940
I'm Mia Gaia Jekyll I also verb to

00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:58,950
Miyagawa Jekyll is a static website

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,510
generator it's written in Ruby it's blog

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:02,910
aware its github friendly it's got a

00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,530
built-in dev server it uses markdown or

00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,059
text out whatever you like and it's got

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,890
pluggable templates and blob of all its

00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:10,230
cool

00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:11,760
it does it does all that stuff to passes

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,480
the Jekyll test suite it's written in

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,240
Perl it's not on Sipan yet so what I

00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,890
learned from doing this is if you went

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,049
to me ago is talk this is like the the

00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:23,580
TLDR version of it this is good it's fun

00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:25,380
to do this it's interesting and you'll

00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,419
learn stuff you should probably try to

00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,860
do it at least once you don't need to

00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:31,559
know the language that the project

00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,120
you're jacking is written in because all

00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,530
the dynamic languages are pretty much

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,330
the same you just kind of look at the

00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:37,830
overall language the logic flow and it's

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,049
you know you'll learn stuff about the

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:43,590
architecture and it's fun pick a weekend

00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:45,419
and a project and just you know do it so

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,059
who in the room has a module on Sipan at

00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:55,080
least one alright who has a website for

00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:57,059
their module on Sipan want one if you

00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,380
host your project on github they added a

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,000
feature in the past couple of months

00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,620
that gives you a very easy out in the

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,350
admin section there's this automatic

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,000
page generator thing it makes sites for

00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,740
you that are templated they look good

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,120
it's really easy you can actually

00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,429
there's another button that lets you

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,520
copy your readme file over to as the

00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:16,440
basis for this there's all kinds of

00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,610
themes that are available take two

00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,320
minutes for your projects that are

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,900
hosted on github and just do it

00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,909
it looks more professional and as

00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,309
Miyagawa was saying in his talk around

00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:28,080
names this makes things more real to

00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:31,289
people if you have an actual website as

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,360
opposed to just an entry on Sipan or

00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:35,190
there's another option hide drive

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,720
something called vasila plugin published

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,309
website from readme which will do the

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,870
exact same thing for you as part of your

00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:46,380
diesel publishing flow only it doesn't

00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,740
actually exist yet yet I'm gonna write

00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,929
it

00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,740
you should come help me there's a code

00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:52,130
for kit

00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,130
Thanks

00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:03,139
everyone ory I plugged the other day I

00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:04,820
figured another plug burn your brains

00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:06,620
with and all that kind of thing looking

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,779
for work looking for jobs you have jobs

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,980
you want help finding people contact

00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:11,539
pearl hundred calm

00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,120
we had a great pops the other day about

00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:16,519
ten people showed up who was there at

00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:20,389
the buff raise your hand nobody here

00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:30,139
great okay you guys okay that's it

00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:33,769
pearl hunter calm thank you hi I'm

00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:35,029
Brandon C Chicago and I've used pearl

00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:37,429
for a while just for sort of one-off

00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:39,740
scripts but I haven't really tried to

00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:42,880
tackle a big project so this is sort of

00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:47,419
an overview of what I'm thinking about

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:50,720
there's a site called a prisoner of data

00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:53,889
about horse races they've got every

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:58,600
every day they update new information

00:26:53,889 --> 00:27:01,370
it's a brisnet.com BR is any t-dot-com

00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:04,090
and they do charge for it but they do

00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,840
have the free the free data available

00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:09,409
except it cycles through and they've

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:12,409
only got five days worth of data so I've

00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:13,789
been scraping that from the site and so

00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:17,330
far for the past few weeks I have about

00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:19,340
five thousand races at least the betting

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,779
data and then the racing data have tens

00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,090
of thousands left because there's more

00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:25,399
of that in the files the problem is

00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:28,820
they're formatted in a PDF file and it's

00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:31,549
not that easy to access but the kam PDF

00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:34,130
module makes it pretty easy some regular

00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:36,950
expressions it's not too hard so this is

00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:39,460
what it looks like this is the PDF it's

00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:41,600
really dense to give you an example

00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,769
here's just sort of an explanation of

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,830
what they have everything from

00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:49,730
medication to track conditions to

00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:53,630
weather to the horses past few race

00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:55,370
results so it's a lot of information but

00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,980
with a little bit of code looks

00:27:55,370 --> 00:28:01,190
something like this with can PDF you can

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:03,230
get an output that looks sort of like

00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:06,320
this it's not perfect but it's it's

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:08,029
decent with regular expressions I

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,909
haven't gotten too far with that yet I

00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:12,860
just know it it works well enough

00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:15,770
and then another form of the data they

00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:17,779
have is an HTML file with all of the the

00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:20,779
results in the winnings for each

00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:23,299
different type of bet and pushing the

00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:25,880
putting these together will make for a

00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:27,169
pretty complete data set on on horse

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,470
racing running whatever kind of models

00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:32,150
or simulations you need to do so from

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,789
here on out I'm trying to streamline

00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:37,039
what I have right now I just have a few

00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:41,480
scripts that I'm trying to sort of work

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:43,909
into a pro module and I have to sort of

00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,679
address the fact the the data is not

00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:48,770
going to be complete I'm gonna have to

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,539
make up for for missing data or data

00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,159
that changes from race to race like if a

00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:55,460
horse gets traded to a different trainer

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,110
or bought and then sort of once I have

00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,850
all of the data in the database I'm

00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,279
gonna try and sort of experiment with

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:07,220
different methods of analyzing it and

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:10,279
trying to exploit the the data and then

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:13,610
trim to find a way to access the data no

00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:15,409
matter what or what device I'm on I've

00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:18,710
been looking into not only web

00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:20,899
interfaces but also text message just in

00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:23,149
case if I'm gonna track and it doesn't

00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:25,330
allow laptops or internet that would be

00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:28,130
a really convenient way of handling it

00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:29,539
so and because I'm scraping it from the

00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,100
site and they're free I'm not sure

00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:34,190
exactly what I can legally make money

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,630
off of or release for free so I'm sort

00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,490
of gonna kind of play that by ear see

00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:40,309
how it goes but if you'd like to help

00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:42,950
out let me know here's my email I'm also

00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:44,830
graduating soon and looking for work so

00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,750
if you have questions comments anything

00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:50,240
all right anything just send me an email

00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,649
and check out my github I don't have too

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,740
much there now I have a lot of private

00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:56,659
stuff but nothing public I'm hoping as

00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:59,120
this project continues I'll have stuff

00:29:56,659 --> 00:30:03,250
to release whether as a full module or

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,250
just pieces thank you

00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:13,360
so I'd like to announce a new pull

00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,340
monger group we now have Hardware dot

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,250
p.m. Thank You Johanna we have a mailing

00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:20,710
list I have organizational unit on

00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,230
github so there definitely will be you

00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:25,690
know owner bit spread like water if you

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,190
come and you can use apparently cool new

00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,840
tools thanks Jean hack to build us nice

00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,240
websites you know

00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,700
so anyway hardware p.m. it's

00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,419
non-geographical obviously so anyway

00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,419
join up

00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:46,120
okay well I'm doing this talk all wrong

00:30:43,649 --> 00:30:51,760
first of all I want to say it's my first

00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:54,460
job see it's been very nice it's really

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,710
been great but you know usually when you

00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,990
do a talk you you write it and you

00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:00,640
polish it and then you like maybe

00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,559
present it to yourself in the mirror or

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,789
to your spouse or your to your boss and

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,159
then you present it in front of a whole

00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:07,750
group well I did this one hastily and

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,049
I'm presenting to the whole group and

00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:14,110
we'll eventually presenting to my boss

00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:15,429
so the title of my talk is I hate this

00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:18,370
slide while you still can use it with my

00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:20,980
advantage and as you can tell I'm do

00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:22,419
bioinformatics at Purdue now the site

00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,870
I'm talking about is this slide here

00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:29,470
which unfortunately so I go to a lot of

00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:31,779
biological talks of I uh and people with

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,730
biology and went to a couple a couple

00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:35,890
weeks ago and each time they brought up

00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:39,309
this damn slide and I hate it

00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:42,549
and even today somebody brought up this

00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:44,500
slide it's pretty bad so why do I hate

00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:47,320
this fight well it's not because of the

00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:50,230
data it's because of the way it's put

00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,240
together so we have the cost of

00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:53,649
sequencing and you can see that there's

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,799
an inflection point and it's really

00:31:53,649 --> 00:31:58,630
gotten really really cheap lately and

00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:00,340
everybody says oh well that's comparable

00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:02,200
to Moore's law Moore's law is not doing

00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,750
a very good job there you know and and

00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,730
the idea is I guess that you know the

00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,320
cost of sequencing is so bad that it's

00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:10,360
not keeping up with you know Moore's law

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,950
is not keeping up with it but what is

00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,399
Moore's law we all know Moore's law is

00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:17,679
just simply a number of transistors per

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,750
you know whatever you put on the chip it

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,750
doubles every

00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:25,110
two years or stuff like that has nothing

00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:27,780
to do with cost nothing at all so I mean

00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:30,330
the cost of doing computing doesn't

00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:33,090
necessarily follow Moore's law I mean

00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,800
the cost of a chip is just you know does

00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:37,050
it have to do anything with the total

00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,180
cost of the sequencing or you know the

00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:41,790
speed of computing has nothing to do

00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:43,260
with how fast I can get things done I

00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:45,360
could have better algorithms I could

00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:48,480
have worse algorithms I could do modern

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,940
CPUs or not anything else at all anyway

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,160
this is my big Bugaboo I keep talking to

00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,290
my boss about it he says just get over

00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,550
with it they just means Moore's law and

00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,490
I said well fine if they use an

00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,690
exponential function I mean say

00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,790
sequencing is not polling expert dungeon

00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:05,250
function but you go into a biology group

00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:08,700
and somebody puts up the slide and they

00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:11,100
say it's not following Moore's law oh

00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,910
yeah I've heard Moore's law before it

00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,910
must mean something

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,730
okay so I've resigned myself to go with

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:22,770
the flow and use Moore's law to my

00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:26,490
advantage I hope so

00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:28,110
my first slide okay the inverse of my

00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,700
celly so this is my salary I've been

00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,810
working at the genomics facility for

00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,420
about as long as this slide has been

00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:35,130
going on which has been over 10 years

00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:37,590
and plotting the you know what my salary

00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:40,050
looks like it hasn't been very good it's

00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:42,810
not following Moore's law well if we're

00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:46,980
gonna follow Moore's law make my salary

00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:48,480
follow Moore's law and you know in the

00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,160
mean time the amount of work I'm doing

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,070
how much data processing I get done

00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,560
every every week is well you know I'm

00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,940
not quite following what the the DNA

00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,370
sequences are doing at the moment but

00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,670
I'm doing a pretty good job and then I

00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:04,890
can go and say well what's my value to

00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,510
Purdue off of this you know you know my

00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:09,060
mic you know how much they're paying me

00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:12,110
versus how much I'm working my values

00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,110
pretty damn good

00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:18,730
so I come up with this cute QR ma asset

00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,379
because my boss has been lately saying

00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,190
get this stuff done faster get this

00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:22,659
sun's faster

00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,190
we're on safe well I'm gonna use the red

00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:26,969
line now and say Kirk lighting my ass

00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:32,889
I'm doing a good job here

00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:34,389
[Applause]

00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:37,899
[Music]

00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:42,289
[Applause]

00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:44,179
hello again I'm still util we've already

00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:46,190
got a show of hands of who's you know

00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:48,319
their first time here but who is it

00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:51,369
among the first time here that this is

00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:53,329
actually your first encounter

00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:55,730
interaction with the Pearl

00:34:53,329 --> 00:35:00,309
community-at-large Big Show hands please

00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:04,940
a lot of people now that you're here

00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:09,289
don't disappear I give this talk every

00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:10,880
year yeah see when I can you don't have

00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:13,009
to wait till the next you have to I know

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,299
you're all coming back to ya see you're

00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:20,499
inspired but you want that fix of social

00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:23,749
interaction during the year and we have

00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:25,190
IRC we have pearl mongers will help you

00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:28,400
start a pro mongers group if you don't

00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:30,920
have one nearby and there's just lots

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,289
and lots of options real-time semi

00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,779
real-time face-to-face and now there's

00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:38,119
documentation for it on anything from

00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:39,109
pearl ten on you can say pearl dock

00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:41,630
space

00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:43,489
pearl community and we've got a whole

00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,380
lot of options for you there or you just

00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:48,259
ask me and I'll tell you how to get your

00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,690
fix so I hope Dino I'll see you all

00:35:48,259 --> 00:35:52,240
again very soon and I love you all

00:35:50,690 --> 00:36:00,010
Natalie thank you

00:35:52,240 --> 00:36:00,010
[Applause]

00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:12,040
that Tim I am that Tim I am I dislike

00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:15,760
his code that Tim I am be like purlin

00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:20,980
Sipan I didn't like them Tim I am I won

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:24,250
a code Perl on Saipan what they fit your

00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:28,300
application frame my application frame

00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:31,660
are you named not a model view or

00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:34,270
control don't play your game I do not

00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,670
like Poe and Saipan I do not like the

00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:40,359
Tim I am

00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:45,600
do you like catalyst dancer arm Oh

00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:45,600
delicious all declare they are delicious

00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,080
catalyst and some vocal issues how do

00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,450
you they you declare them to be

00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,310
delicious they will not fit my

00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:58,180
application frame I declare to you sir

00:36:54,310 --> 00:37:00,400
you are inane I do not like pill and

00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:04,180
Sipan I do not like them

00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:09,310
Tim I am would you like to try posits

00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:11,380
would you try it's pearly spits I would

00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:14,619
not like to try pulse it so I could not

00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,869
try it's purely spirits I do not like

00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:22,300
pill on Saipan I do not like them Tim I

00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:28,030
am would you deploy with my pill five it

00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:31,240
now has mousse it's so alive I will not

00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:35,350
deploy with Europa five I don't believe

00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:37,210
that it's alive get it into your pearly

00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:42,850
head we spread the word the Pearl is

00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:46,750
dead I do not like pearl on Japan but do

00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:51,369
not like them Tim I am what he is on a

00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:54,710
plane I cannot use it on a plane

00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:57,140
but even why is that insane

00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:01,440
[Applause]

00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:04,830
would you use it for a wiki it makes how

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,070
things seem less tricky I could not use

00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:14,099
it for a wiki I think you may have took

00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:16,260
the mickey no other claims that's insane

00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:18,540
Oh be my application frame no catalyst

00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,230
answer and no delicious even if they are

00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,150
delicious

00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,619
I will not tire your pearly sits I do

00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:24,960
not want it's pearly tricks

00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:28,520
I won't deploy now pro/5 I will not

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,410
listen it's not a life I do not like

00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:38,180
Polanski pan I do not like them

00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:38,180
Tim I am you could use our pearl to curl

00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:47,430
you pearl to curl your pearl to kill

00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:52,170
I could never give it a whirl would you

00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:54,180
like to try some part try some part you

00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,570
silly sod do I look like a pole dad

00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:59,160
[Music]

00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:01,170
that's on a plane is rice insane I'll be

00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,670

no it's so cool I gotta try to speak

00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:11,310
closer to the microphone because I hear

00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:14,760
anyone else so if if I'm not clear you

00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:18,450

00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,530
obvious dancer tutorial so do we are we

00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:21,360
starting the clock cause I'm starting

00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,650
mine running so we're gonna start

00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,150
websites gonna be really fast we're

00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:26,370
gonna find them all John Sipan using

00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:30,240
text now front except slow down interest

00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:31,770
except now oh my god looks like they're

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,210
upside down give it a text that's pretty

00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:35,040
simple installed answer you know how it

00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:36,390
works great disguising using an answer

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,780
application listen you stalled you just

00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,370
really

00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:41,520
directory structure that's how it looks

00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:43,590
we're going to the an encode to the lid

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,990
there's a get slash and that's where you

00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:47,700
put your stuff we're gonna have the code

00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:49,320
get a parameter use emporiums there we

00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,490
go the parameters called text we get it

00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:54,420
we clean up some things you have seen

00:41:50,490 --> 00:42:06,690
down whatever 13 and then we put it

00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:08,280
inside to get route TT and we gotta pray

00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,110
together this is how it looks is the

00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,690
entire danger code then you go create

00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:14,460
the template basically a phone that's in

00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:15,960
text that's text the input to write the

00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,210
text displayed the text upside now push

00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,150
the button somehow there's a profit

00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:24,720
there you have them form here and we put

00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:26,280
their text value there and that's an

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,470
input that's gonna show the text and

00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,690
that's gonna be more text and that's

00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:32,550
about it and this looks is actually a

00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:34,020
website that marker from can erode they

00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,510
just liked it so much I have to do or

00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:39,720
what legging talk about it right moving

lot together even though we were really

00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:10,220
different in our theological ideas we

00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,900

really close and and I keep saying that

00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:48,119
guy an innkeeper see he's looking at me

00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:50,519
from the side sorry wait so a few

00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,690
different experiences every time I meet

00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:53,400
someone here they say oh you're from

00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:55,109
Israel cool and I have to fight well no

00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,289
no really but thank you I you really do

00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:59,999
appreciate the gesture I went to Bed

00:44:58,289 --> 00:45:01,170
Bath & Beyond took me an hour I called

00:44:59,999 --> 00:45:03,390
my mom what do you want she says

00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:04,920
tweezers holders really

00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:07,109
I bought five packs the guy thought I

00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,839
was robbing them and opening a chapter

00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:12,150
over there trying to compete I saw a cop

00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:13,710
dunking to water this was the best day

00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:16,109
ever in the States

00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:18,359
I went to a few shows in little shower

00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:21,390
function karaoke Superstars show into a

00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:23,130
crappy show they can vouch for that and

00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:27,539
every time someone meets me to say so

00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:31,019
you ever think the answer guy I have few

00:45:27,539 --> 00:45:32,849
not realize I'm wrapping up so I find I

00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:35,039
found the bikes for in the twenty

00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:36,660
dollars for 24 hours that was really

00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:37,799
cool well not really because then

00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:41,849
someone told me that there are free

00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:45,329
bikes available elsewhere so I'm really

00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:46,440
got cheap bikes for free well it would

00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:48,989
have been great but not really because

00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,609
my ass really hurts they're really

00:45:48,989 --> 00:45:54,660
really cheap every time you get up on

00:45:50,609 --> 00:45:56,730
them Tammy and oh by the way the deal

00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,109
was I have to return them by November it

00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:02,480
was really hard I'm part of all that

00:45:58,109 --> 00:46:02,480
laughter and say I think can do it

00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:07,140
there's a con here it starts apparently

00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:10,680
very new mandatory wear cycle helmets

00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:12,269
I'm a motorcycle driver but the pro here

00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,930
is that you have automatic Jeep a

00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,930
pruning

00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:20,520
like that idea that is really cool you

00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:21,780
have I'm getting so I decided to give a

00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,660
talk of the option that's a pro right

00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:27,990
yeah and I was up against Tom Duran

00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,910
right there shorts god dammit how am I

00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:31,650
gonna compete with that thing alright I

00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:33,089
suggested you talk about my experience

00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,650
this is this talk they've heard me and

00:46:33,089 --> 00:46:36,089
they wrote me suggested he will do talk

00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:39,569
about how much I eat which is apparently

00:46:36,089 --> 00:46:40,680
a lot I finished the whole menu of a

00:46:39,569 --> 00:46:43,619
restaurant I'm not kidding

00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,300
alright I was often drink a few times it

00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:48,230
was the first time ever someone offered

00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:52,700
me a drink on I don't drink at all ever

00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:56,520

jt2 and what do you think they did and

00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:22,410
he was like that's a good idea and said

00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:24,270

00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:22,300
figuring out but that's kind of Carnegie

00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,280
Mellon with dates but the one cool thing

00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,870
Carnegie Mellon did with cert is they

00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,390
released the secure coding standard for

00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:32,530
Perl which they did first in C C++ and

00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:33,820
Java and then Perl so not Ruby not

00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:35,650
Python and all that

00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:38,320
very cool stuff the really good thing is

00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:41,320
my wife told me about it

00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:43,120
not the Perl community so I hope you

00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,470
guys jump on the start website take a

00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,670
look at the coding standard and maybe

00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,360
give some feedback to them and make sure

00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:56,230
that we as a community appreciate it

00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:58,450
thank you so we also need to talk to

00:48:56,230 --> 00:49:01,090
introduce the people to the FCU of 2012

00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:04,090
so it will be in Frankfurt I think you

00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:09,400
guys know and finder xx I'll go through

00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:11,020
22 at 22 22 August and it will be in the

00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,480
middle of Germany in the middle of

00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:16,330
Europe at Frankfurt and that's why I

00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:18,370
suggest people if if you thought about

00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:21,160
coming you should come cause you can

00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:23,230
actually reach nearly everything from

00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,910
there to ours right everywhere four or

00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:26,560
five hours train you get everywhere you

00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:28,570
get to Prague you get to Rome to get to

00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,010
Paris to learn on 2 billion you can

00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:32,050
actually go everywhere and make a nice

00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:38,020
holiday after or before the apps after

00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:44,080
before the FC oh can you please wait

00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:46,780
till the slide comes yes so so you can

00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:50,580
also go to boss Barcelona or team cuz

00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,580
it's really cheap right now

00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:58,330
Mehta Stroud and Larry wall are coming

00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:59,980
they're already set they come and listen

00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:05,200
when you will bring the biggest book

00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:08,290
shelf with all the power books and and

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,420
also yet Cu and move to moved to MU

00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:13,090
sockets on is to MU socket on has two

00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,680
days after the AB see you and really

00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:17,200
back and told me there is a program

00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,870
between sadly he doesn't told me what

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,850
program so there is something in between

00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:23,980
so when you have one wanted to go to the

00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:28,090
move to MU socket on then you can also

00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:29,740
come and and sadly I can't say really

00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:40,150
more cause it's a yup C and it will be

00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:42,550
cool as you know so thank you so I

00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:44,350
figured since I had a con a conference

00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:48,130
here in Madison I should use it a little

00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:49,810
bit to promote mad mongers so there's a

00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:52,330
lot of people from Madison here right

00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:53,800
now that don't ever come to mad mongers

00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:55,480
so I just wanted to say the third

00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,330
Tuesday of every month

00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:00,340
so therefore July 17th will be the next

00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:02,200
one come on down to the essent house

00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,750
seven o'clock third Tuesday of every

00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,910
month join us we do awesome talks and if

00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:08,920
there's some area of Perl they you just

00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:10,870
want to learn something more about we'll

00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,280
do a talk for you on that topic you just

00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:14,280
suggested all right thanks

00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:20,829
[Applause]

00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:34,030
alright does this work can you kiss

00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:35,530
anyone here this yeah it's just I I

00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:37,750
don't know why that's happened it's just

00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:39,369
some misalignment thing the the sides

00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,270
are particularly unimportant so I

00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:42,520
wouldn't worry about that

00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:45,609
okay so I've seen a lot of talks that

00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:47,320
advocate worse is better and like the

00:51:45,609 --> 00:51:50,380
usual justification has it worked for

00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:53,200
UNIX and I'm lazy so let's go with it

00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:55,810
so I saw some code for downloading a

00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:58,660
webpage that somebody gave as a worse is

00:51:55,810 --> 00:52:00,040
better example this is the version that

00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,740
I wrote because I wasn't actually at the

00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,510
talk so the web page to download is just

00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,800
in dollar sign underscore and then

00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:07,390
that's pretty much how you would

00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,070
download a web page right like you just

00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:11,890
strip out the last thing and then it'll

00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:13,570
probably show up in a file eventually so

00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:15,730
there's nothing wrong with that right I

00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:17,500
tried it and it works I put a carefully

00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:19,390
named text file on my web server and

00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,700
then downloaded it and it was in that

00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:23,619
variable that must mean it's good but

00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,849
the code kind of feels bad don't you

00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:27,609
think doesn't there feel like there's

00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:29,349
something wrong with this somewhere okay

00:52:27,609 --> 00:52:30,520
so it kind of looks like line noise up

00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:31,540
at the top that should worry you a

00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,069
little bit there are a lot of

00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,300
assumptions like what the file is going

00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:36,220
to be called and that there aren't going

00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:38,589
to be redirects and there's all this

00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:40,589
quoting and parsing we exacting the

00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:44,380
shell at some point we're catting things

00:52:40,589 --> 00:52:46,119
and the code is all glue there's really

00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:47,349
no way to improve this for next time

00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:48,819
right the next time you want to download

00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:51,130
a web page you're just gonna cut and

00:52:48,819 --> 00:52:52,329
paste the same stuff and when is it ever

00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:54,760
gonna get better when you're gonna make

00:52:52,329 --> 00:52:57,190
this better also like overwriting files

00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,540
based on what the server sends you and

00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:59,560
deleting stuff and exacting shell

00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,359
commands is bad

00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,829
I mostly put this slide in here for the

00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,000
people to download this talk later and

00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:06,749
they're like ooh this is how you go to a

00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,950
web page and Carl

00:53:06,749 --> 00:53:10,720
yeah so we want to be able to improve

00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,400
our code right like even though worst is

00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,779
better we want to be able to improve the

00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,619
code and get better over time right

00:53:13,779 --> 00:53:17,440
because we don't want to be worse

00:53:14,619 --> 00:53:19,119
forever otherwise it would be like 1960

00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,920
and we'd be like flipping switches on

00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,920
ENIAC or whatever you guys did back then

00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:29,349
yeah so writing this code from scratch

00:53:28,029 --> 00:53:31,200
every time it's not helpful we don't

00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:33,579
learn anything we can't reuse anything

00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,410
so what can we do that's better than

00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:38,470
that well I say we should learn about

00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:39,759
libraries and learn about programming we

00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:41,319
should let your code improve as you

00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:43,269
improve as a programmer let the

00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:45,369
libraries handle the details and let

00:53:43,269 --> 00:53:47,140
your code your application code describe

00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:49,480
its function not how to do something say

00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:51,490
I want this webpage not strip off the

00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:54,190
path using this red X and then system to

00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:55,599
W get and so on and so what I say is

00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:57,099
don't be a library author when you're

00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,720
being an application author right

00:53:57,099 --> 00:54:00,249
your application is a separate piece of

00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,249
code your libraries are a separate piece

00:54:00,249 --> 00:54:05,950
of code and focus on each one at the

00:54:03,249 --> 00:54:08,019
same time or at different times okay so

00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:10,029
my first foray into this was any event

00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:15,190
sub process which is basically like po

00:54:10,029 --> 00:54:16,690
component run okay so I was doing the

00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:19,359
same thing over and over like I was

00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:22,059
exacting processes weight ped dumping

00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:23,650
FDS who knows what I was doing I didn't

00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:25,720
know what I was doing like nothing good

00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:27,039
ever came of that my life was sad

00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,450
because every time I wanted to exact a

00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:30,489
process it just didn't work the way I

00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:34,089
wanted and then I made this smiley face

00:54:30,489 --> 00:54:35,650
regularly so one day I decided I was

00:54:34,089 --> 00:54:37,809
gonna learn everything about Unix I was

00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:40,720
gonna learn our pipes and FDS and dump

00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:42,220
and sudo of TT wise and sockets and all

00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,589
this good stuff so that I could write a

00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:46,239
library that could actually be improved

00:54:44,589 --> 00:54:48,249
like instead of writing the shitty code

00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:49,390
every time I have it in a library and

00:54:48,249 --> 00:54:51,700
then I could improve it as I learn more

00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:53,650
and now my stuff just works when I want

00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:55,029
to exec a subprocess yeah okay so

00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:56,890
there's this thousand lines of code I

00:54:55,029 --> 00:54:59,200
wrote to make it clean but I only see

00:54:56,890 --> 00:55:01,059
one code in my application one line of

00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,519
code in my application and my stuff just

00:55:01,059 --> 00:55:06,670
works now like I can write the bike

00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:10,450
control C to my process and then it gets

00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:12,819
sig int just from the magic of Unix so

00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:14,049
other thoughts programming seems hard

00:55:12,819 --> 00:55:15,140
you're doing it wrong I've seen a lot of

00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:17,240
hacks

00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,280
where people like get themselves into

00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,570
some problem and then they write code to

00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,640
get themselves out of the problem and

00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:25,040
this just snowballs if you need a lot of

00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:27,530
hacks to like do something you've done

00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,520
something else wrong step back and try

00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:31,550
to think about what you're trying to

00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:33,710
achieve okay so the test trap talk yeah

00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:35,360
I like the test trap talk if you have to

00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:37,100
do this if you have to use test trap to

00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:39,290
make your code testable you've done

00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,730
something horribly wrong and Randall's

00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:43,160
argument was you can't touch the code

00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:44,450
well you have to touch the code you

00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,090
can't be a programmer if you can't edit

00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:48,710
the code don't hack around it figure out

00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:50,690
how to edit the code when you can

00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:52,370
improve your code you need less hacks

00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:56,360
okay so I'm gonna skip this example

00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:59,060
because it's stupid and amount of time

00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:01,970
yeah so if programming is hard it's

00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:03,230
because you made it hard try to do

00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:05,330
something better and it will be better

00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:06,770
feel good about writing good code don't

00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:09,320
let people talking into worse is better

00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:11,210
write good code learn all the time so

00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,800
you can improve your libraries use your

00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:14,810
knowledge to write better code don't

00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:17,630
trade the future for now spend some time

00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:19,840
now and better is better not worse is

00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:19,840
better

00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:30,010
[Applause]

00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:32,590
hello everybody I just wanted to give a

00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:35,020
big compliment to the yep see America

00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:41,760
staff mad mongers for putting on the

00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:45,070
live streaming video of Yap site and

00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:47,200
making sure that what we experienced

00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:49,450
here can be shared with everybody around

00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,760
the world and I've seen on IRC and

00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:58,450
everybody else people are watching thank

00:56:51,760 --> 00:57:00,520
you and let's do this again next year

00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:07,480
and the year after that entered all the

00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:09,300
apps the events please I would like to

00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:12,460
point out that the talk I gave earlier

00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:14,380
was about a piece of sponsored

00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:16,780
development for a customer of shadowcats

00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:18,940
which is social flow were kind enough to

00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:21,250
let me present it and their entire

00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:23,050
development team gathered round and

00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:24,870
watched the video of my talk about the

00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:28,200
software they paid us to build for them

00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:28,200
so cool

00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:36,760
[Applause]

00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:39,380
this is the end of everything

00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:43,070
so I happen to do quite a lots of

00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:56,810
supporting people you got our bloody

00:57:43,070 --> 00:58:00,260
bang there we go so this is the end of

00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:02,450
everything I happened to hang out quite

00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:05,240
a lot on freenode hash pearl and helping

00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:06,950
people do things which allows me to

00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:09,619
discover all sorts of interesting things

00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:11,869
that you people to pull around try

00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:13,400
trying to deal with an herb so on and so

00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:15,200
forth but actually getting an idea of

00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:18,140
what problems people are striking and

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:28,460
what are the things that always happens

00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:30,560
in people so much I mean I can deal with

00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:32,869
a fair amount of dump but the refusing

00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:41,020
to use even though five is a virtual

00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:43,390
machine seep and it's the language why

00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:46,820
why do you think you can't you see that

00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:49,250
I'm not wilt so I go well that's

00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:51,290
absolutely fine here's how you make soup

00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:52,820
on top and do the right thing all you

00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:55,760
need to do is set for configuration

00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:57,650
options reload the index go into the

00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,599
shell look back in don't get any of

00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:00,109
those steps running in any way shape or

00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:02,920
form

00:59:00,109 --> 00:59:05,750
upgrade your version of module build the

00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:07,849
directory path so if you've got one

00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:10,130
before naught point three eight it all

00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:11,690
breaks when you look great past it the

00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:14,390
new paths by the way a Bachelor and that

00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:16,369
was years ago and I'm not actually

00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:17,839
really complaining about that but oh my

00:59:16,369 --> 00:59:19,640
god will you get to the point of twenty

00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:26,619
minutes later and they've still no to

00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:26,619
the remote you'll install sorry mo cloak

00:59:30,569 --> 00:59:35,500
okay so far so good

00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:37,420
and then they go what I need to deploy a

00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:43,810
single file because it needs to be

00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:47,290
copied to a particular server oh well

00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:49,359
okay let's try to make parties one pp

00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:53,500
with these 27 different options

00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:59,310
ah then it's going to blow up again and

00:59:53,500 --> 01:00:06,430
again and again and 20 minutes later ah

00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:08,230
so I wrote up fat again so far so

01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:11,109
good and then Mayor gal was kind enough

01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:13,960
to use that fat packer to bundle local

01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:18,280
it in to see by - makes things even

01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:21,280
easier ah so so far so good

01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:23,050
ah make me run into the other problem

01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:28,089
cuz they go this it needs to run one

01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:30,280
some 200 machines I'm fat biking is kind

01:00:28,089 --> 01:00:33,609
of an it's relatively easy but it is

01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:36,150
still noticeable effort Oh

01:00:33,609 --> 01:00:36,150
fair point

01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:50,520
okay well to this oh well everybody

01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,140
underscore underscore data that goes

01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:54,000
bold please give me a file and for the

01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,710
rest of these file until you reach

01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,150
underscore underscore I know I'm just

01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:58,770
going to screen is fascinating because

01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:02,250
at that point the POE compiler stops

01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:05,490
reading and both stops pausing and hmm

01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:07,470
let me see if you invoke bass then it's

01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:11,220
reading the script will still in but

01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:15,150
when distilling stays open and that's

01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:16,770
where it starts getting interesting that

01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:22,920
means that I can use a fatback's

01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:24,300
bootstrap do it open vocal - wouldn't

01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,160
the fatback's version of the bootstrap

01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:29,430
code membrane underscore underscore end

01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:31,320
and now I got stood in and stood out to

01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:33,150
do my bidding for whatever that fatback

01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,100
script is doing well okay what about

01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:37,410
communications communications back and

01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:39,480
forth well yeah length of JSON on the

01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:41,250
wire cuz I am stuffed if I'm inventing a

01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:49,350
protocol this is another yak I'm shaving

01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:50,880
already here yes single key object so if

01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:52,530
it gets hashed refs that basically just

01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,840
contains the key of remote object in an

01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:57,240
ID it can take the ID and inflate it to

01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:59,280
a remote object and what you're actually

01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,990
doing is inflating it to a local proxy

01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,910
that calls the remote object and that's

01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:05,010
easy it's just a proxy object with auto

01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:13,110
load all the load is the least scary

01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:14,880
thing here and then you know obviously

01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:16,290
you can't actually use a method for that

01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,030
I have to use the bear hash web because

01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:20,100
I'm using all to load epoxy all method

01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:23,040
calls across wire I didn't want to

01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:24,720
reserve a method name because again when

01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:28,500
also load is the least crack field thing

01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:30,360
you may as well okay oh no I have a

01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:34,500
problem again what about the things I

01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:35,820
didn't get up for these what made fat

01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,360
pack of annoying to use in the first

01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:41,250
place

01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:43,980
mmm hang in a minute fat back to itself

01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:47,100
uses the correct in a sink well you know

01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:48,650
um well nobody said that I grown to use

01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,910
one

01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:52,800
better still I can actually use an

01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:55,680
object than I think I can have one of

01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,570
each so my object looks something like

01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,770
this and it has an ink method which has

01:02:57,570 --> 01:03:00,600
to be declared with the fully qualified

01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:02,520
name because the ink blob is normally

01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:05,250
false in two main says you get defending

01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:07,260
can I think in all of your files do not

01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:09,420
define a confocal then that's really

01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:10,920
confusing by the way because then gets

01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:15,840
forced into main as well don't ask

01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:19,800
anyway so this module then I come from

01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:21,450
the string file and there that's the

01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,830
same thing that fat pack is doing but

01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:24,750
I'd out of the question of where do I

01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:28,080
get them with a very sender form oh well

01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:30,330
that's the easy bit because it's a

01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:33,090
remote object system so I just grabbed

01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:37,170
the remote object from the host machine

01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:41,760
and it's I think I can use and so the

01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:44,160
source house in the ss-18 in finds the

01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:48,359
module and ships across the wire in the

01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:51,930
form of a JSON object and then do a

01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:54,450
little Sharonda although by this phase

01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:56,640
you just because it's sweet if it takes

01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:58,770
a cyanide it might taste almonds it

01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:05,220
might be syntactic cyanide mer I screwed

01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:09,960
that joke up nobody going on and so that

01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:12,480
takes a connection strain or an object

01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,190
remote connection and then you say new

01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:17,070
remote I want an object of this class

01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:19,080
and because Newcomb fully qualified

01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:21,060
method name the method of resolution is

01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:24,240
done against the package new so you

01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:26,820
don't actually have to have loaded the

01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,350
class already in your local script you

01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:30,270
can just do some random plants named

01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:31,230
arrow new : : oh that's all great so

01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:33,990
cool okay

01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:35,550
whoa I just had a thought you see last

01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:37,230
year's high-speed lightning talk was the

01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:40,770
devil's rattle which was about Eva with

01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:42,420
lexical which was a pure pearl bull

01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:44,160
rattle which I want to be able to ship

01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:46,200
it about on the wire I mean fat packer

01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,210
and so on well it's a pure believed

01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:50,070
outrage why don't we use that so now I

01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:51,570
can do evil with light circles new on

01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:53,460
user at hearse and it's going to SSH

01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:54,900
across the wire and giving back a rattle

01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:57,869
with persistent that signals on the far

01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:59,680
side as the sages and them starts up and

01:04:57,869 --> 01:05:01,750
I can use just hosts and if I

01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,339
user at and then would actually does

01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:05,530
this pseudo up so I can actually go

01:05:03,339 --> 01:05:07,960
ss-18 the med start me another chain one

01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:09,910
that's Ruth which I've been using to do

01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:13,000
systems provisioning so I can believe

01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:15,849
element on the curler I can lexical

01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:19,540
persistence is already there or you can

01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:21,220
do it with your own class tasks but then

01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:24,190
then pass whatever arguments you want to

01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:25,900
colossal wire and then you can solve if

01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:27,010
you just want a subroutine don't want to

01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:28,450
fast around with objects that's

01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,680
absolutely fine you can get to this

01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:32,200
hostname hostname that we'll do a

01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,250
require on face hostname and called a

01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:36,069
subroutine for you with whatever

01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:38,619
arguments you supply so if you think you

01:05:36,069 --> 01:05:42,630
still can you sleep and I say you can

01:05:38,619 --> 01:05:42,630
you can you see pantomime

01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:52,180
[Music]

01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:54,400
I I will be shipping it next week just

01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:55,900
please let's not manage me win32 and

01:05:54,400 --> 01:06:01,690
especially not micro-pearl on the

01:05:55,900 --> 01:06:03,160
Nintendo DS thank you very much so real

01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:05,050
quick it occurs to me that I didn't

01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:08,320
mention where we should meet if we want

01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:09,700
to run tomorrow morning so if people are

01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:12,370
actually interested in running tomorrow

01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:13,810
morning we should get together after the

01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:16,300
lightning talks are done upstairs

01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:17,980
outside out front

01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,630
immediately after the lightning talks
