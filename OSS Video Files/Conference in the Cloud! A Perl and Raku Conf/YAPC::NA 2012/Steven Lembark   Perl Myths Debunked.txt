what this is things are so let's start

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,070
because I actually should have been here

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,769
two minutes ago um yeah I guess

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,250
everyone's read the cartoon my app this

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:29,670
is a talk that was written by Tim bunts

00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:31,470
revised a couple of years ago now a bit

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,120
of its out of data talk Sam about how

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:39,809
modern / 05 10 is by a lot of people who

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,980
work with pearl get these myths we get

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,200
them all the time for the curls

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,539
complicated it's confusing it's whatever

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,719
and here are some answers you can give

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,510
people in it's a lot of it just way

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,399
they're people who will say oh I really

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,980
think pearls complicated it's a pain and

00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,840
I ask you is but I still like it that's

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:03,300
a badly to think about it so this gives

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,750
us a better vocabulary for describing

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:10,500
what we use so this is the baseless

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,640
myths talk I didn't write this moment

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,000
have to read the slides with everyone

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,000
but an important thing to and this is

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,460
one thing about Pearl good Larry Wallace

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,610
said a lot of times it's not that he

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,320
doesn't like other languages the ideal

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,820
of a good pearl programmer is someone

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,820
who uses the other languages and

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,640
understands how to pull useful idioms in

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,070
from other languages I mean pearls

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,500
anyone everything from lists pong

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,950
forward thrown into it because they work

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,479
not because Lisp is evil but you have to

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,630
go out and say what is there about list

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:54,710
that's good Python pick a language even

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:57,450
Java has parts that work so anyway um

00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:03,360
one thing too I guess I'm supposed to

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:05,790
stand in the middle of this the the

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,379
notion that pearl is confusing

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:13,530
complicated hard whatever if you look at

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:17,370
what it takes to get

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,560
done you find that good developers have

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,100
more effect than the language if you put

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,350
a group of good programmers in room you

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:29,450
can hand them Perl Python Java Sea

00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:32,150
assembly and the job will get done so

00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:35,580
when you're thinking about the stuff

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,380
again it's not about pearl is

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,550
complicated it's what's the right tool

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:44,060
for a job of pearl works use it this is

00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:48,420
not about me this is the guy rotate

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:51,360
people here know Tim bounces amen yeah

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,570
well but both how many people have used

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,640
anything the Tim buns is written razor

00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:59,819
yeah that's it has anyone here never

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:04,140
worked with a database have you never

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:07,860
used / 05 then you've used Tim bonzes

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:10,950
products so this is this is his version

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,819
of a camel of the first miss I'll deal

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,330
with and I got to go through these

00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:18,329
really fast are about / 05 there's some

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,940
about pearl 62 that are later but here

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:24,299
the myths the first one is pearl is dead

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:27,690
now you think about it pearls 22 when

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:30,209
this is it's 25 years old now profile

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:35,700
has been around for long enough to vote

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:37,110
and that's it's an it's an interest

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,090
thing to bore pointed out in the testing

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,790
class a lot of people don't get involved

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:45,000
in pearl because sipan's got how many

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,380
brazilian modules on it if you're just

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,670
getting a programming and you really

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,890
want to go in and contribute to

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:53,040
something and write the next new great

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:56,459
module that does something it's probably

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,720
already on Sipan so one of the things if

00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,070
we want to attract people into the

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,459
community you've got to find interesting

00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:06,600
things for people to do so there's a

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:10,560
pretty gay um his way of looking at

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,900
pearl there's a lot of thing about Pearl

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,579
buzz the the notion that pearl isn't in

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,950
the news it isn't mentioned therefore

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:19,019
it's dead it's dying whatever but what's

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,850
interesting is if if you look at this

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:25,730
and you think what languages might these

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:30,570
be through and this was the end of

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:35,280
2009 if you look at web developer people

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:37,350
really want people with PHP what most

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,150
people use perform who are some you know

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,750
with some of the most heavy duty users

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:45,840
of pearl are on the planet the financial

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,340
firms they just don't advertise a lot of

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,650
pearl because they're very secretive

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:53,760
about what they do if you look for

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:55,050
software engineers guess what pearl is

00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,000
is one of the most heavily used

00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,640
languages if you get out of just

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,150
thinking of pearl as a web language it's

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:06,870
very much alive in bioinformatics in

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:09,630
finance and a lot of other areas if you

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,330
look at we can skip through these wise

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,640
pearl doing so well think about it Sipan

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,400
is one reason even if you even if it's

00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,450
hard to find things sometimes if you go

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,000
to prolong so if you go to other places

00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,970
you can find what people know is on

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,240
Sipan if you look at the number of

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,350
modules that people use heavily these

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,440
are things that are an active

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:34,350
development having this many things

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,170
being worked on pittle po the rest of it

00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,730
that the new stuff with plaque doesn't

00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,560
sound like a dead language to me it

00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:43,670
sounds like people are actively doing it

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:48,930
if you look at where Sipan is we can

00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:51,930
skip that a couple of these um if you're

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:55,260
using Sipan if you push your work on to

00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,940
see pan you get a lot of things out of

00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,290
it one thing is the smoke testing does

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,970
anyone how many people here have modules

00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:04,530
on SI phan bramble you know of it one of

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,720
the things you get if you subscribe to

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:10,920
it are the smoke tests so one thing that

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:14,040
happens every single day is pearl on

00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:18,630
virtual machines compiled for threading

00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:20,220
not threading 386 is 46 is AMD's I think

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,800
there's even one during VMs out there

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,550
somewhere they will they will smoke test

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,890
the do a make test install on your

00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:32,910
module and I get a list every day of a

00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:34,740
dozen things that hopefully past but

00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,650
these are platforms I have no access to

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,910
I'll never want to have access to 45 of

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,140
these platforms and

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,080
get them every day just by sticking

00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,520
things on sea pen again that that's the

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,400
sign of something that's alive there's

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,170
active work going on and the level of

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,700
smoke testing that you get out of Sipan

00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:54,450
is I think ahead of any other language

00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:58,050
on the planet searched at Sipan dot org

00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:59,400
people use that it's fun just to wander

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,140
through it sometime type something

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,140
you're working on and see how many

00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:07,140
modules have that name in it and again

00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,400
you'll find is a very much alive thing

00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:14,430
because you'll find new things all the

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:17,190
time the upload rate to see pan again

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:20,340
this is a bit dated the graph is even

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:22,020
higher doesn't sound like a dead

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,360
language to me people are actively

00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:29,700
putting things into the community

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:32,730
archive the new distros the number of

00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:36,150
contributors keeps going up the code on

00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,710
Sipan a lot of it is new if if you look

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,940
at when are the most recent things

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,910
there's one of the things you can get on

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:44,280
those a mailing list or there's a list

00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:47,250
on pause of things that were pushed in

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,020
today and I stopped subscribing it to it

00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,810
because there's too much stuff going in

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,660
I just don't have time to look at it

00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:56,430
that doesn't sound like a dead language

00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:59,010
when people are putting that much new

00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:03,180
material onto the archive every single

00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:07,010
day the Pearl community the the perl

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:10,080
mongers you know the we're here Yap see

00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:12,419
there is a lot going on in the pearl

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,700
community which again doesn't sound like

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:20,370
a dead language um pearl gets used for a

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:24,419
lot of things java gets pushed part

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:27,030
because sun sells it but there were a

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,410
number of people here at the meeting who

00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,330
worked for an insurance company that's

00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,450
doing all their work and pearl they're

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,700
switching from cobalt over so there are

00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,890
projects that are that are adopting

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,070
parole today there are a lot of startups

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:44,520
that use pearl so again i dead isn't a

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,200
language that i'd use for this so

00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:50,550
there's the people at all it looks like

00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,980
you know there's all the jokes about you

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,740
know there's no obfuscating pearl

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:58,430
Cheska's you don't need to obfuscate it

00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:00,320
boy this is an interesting thing about

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:04,399
parole there's more than one way to do

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:07,699
it there's a lot of phrases in Perl

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,329
about this but the point is pearl makes

00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:12,949
the assumption that you're a programmer

00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:15,949
if you're writing pearl you're

00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:18,170
programming it and therefore it's up to

00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:21,380
you to decide what you think is

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,690
appropriate if you you know the format

00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,820
of the code how you use libraries where

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:28,310
they use objects are functional or

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,990
whatever you can do everything is copied

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,699
by value if you'd like to do it that way

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,820
you can manage the stack if you like it

00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:37,820
that way you have control that level of

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,290
control that level of freedom means yes

00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,610
if you look at somebody else's code you

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:43,339
may think they're complete cuz

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,709
they didn't do it the way you did it but

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,959
that level of freedom also allows you to

00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:50,660
do a lot of things you can't do easily

00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:53,930
in other languages if you look at it

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:57,170
today there are things that one thing we

00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:59,000
can do is clean up the code you it's

00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:00,980
possible to make pro that looks prettier

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,680
or at least get feedback on whether

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,680
you're doing it right pro best practices

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,000
is a neat book one thing people don't do

00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,430
how many people here have Pro best

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,639
practices right have you actually read

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:16,060
the introduction all of it because the

00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:19,459
entire book is on the bottom page 10

00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:23,300
dami points up all of this is friendly

00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:25,310
advice develop consciously develop your

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,130
programming style and be consistent

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:30,740
about it take the time to think about

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:35,300
the way you program the rest of the book

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,949
is fluff if you just do that much stop

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,459
and ask yourself why am i doing at this

00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:42,980
one there are a lot of tools in Perl for

00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:44,600
doing that you can use pearl tidy one

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,370
thing you do is plug your stuff through

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,680
pearl tidy with a different format and

00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,899
ask does any of this look any better

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,260
than the way I do it is there any of

00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:55,430
this that's clearer after I tidy it up

00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,079
most of us don't use proton it because

00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,709
you whatever you do you do it you're

00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:02,540
used to looking at it try it you know I

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,310
usually look at yo fat and throw it away

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,510
but I've picked up a few things that I

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,980
do now

00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:11,870
because they looked better after i

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:14,270
tidied them pro critic again you know it

00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,520
at a certain point was it didn't see

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:20,000
chromatics talk yesterday when doing it

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,920
wrong as doing it right pearl critic is

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,960
is one of those doing it right kind of

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,820
things here is in an ideal world you do

00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,700
everything this way we don't live in an

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,230
ideal world and frankly it's wrong

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,660
sometimes but at least it gives you

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,930
feedback and it's a quick and dirty way

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:40,550
to get feedback as you're working pearl

00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:43,640
testing great thing v if you design code

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:46,010
that can be tested it probably is a hell

00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,540
of a lot easier to read if all your

00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,730
writer these you know multi-page

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,010
functions it's going to heart be hard to

00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:55,040
unit test them think about how you test

00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,480
things go back into testing and you find

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,480
if you make things testable they're

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,820
probably a lot more readable the the

00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,590
Pearl culture for testing I don't know

00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,200
of any other language where something

00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:09,140
like Sipan get smoked tested every

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:13,040
single day with a random selection of

00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:15,470
platforms random selection of modules so

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,280
the the test the tap protocol which I

00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,370
think they were trying to make a

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,100
standard that kind of died but there are

00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:24,350
so many test modules you can design

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,380
tests that work well with your code

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:30,170
which again helps make your code easier

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:35,450
to read and gives your reports on how it

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:37,100
works anyone use devel cover you know

00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,140
what a dud people know it does it it

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,690
tells you whether or not the tests of

00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,660
exercise to your code it doesn't tell

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,100
you whether the tests mean anything but

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,540
it's a good way to tell whether or not

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,670
you've reached far enough into the code

00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:53,180
to really check the important parts of

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,560
it um you can get all these pretty

00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,980
colorful reports and nothing else

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,930
management loves these things you know

00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:07,280
charts and graphs numbers colors love it

00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:09,800
but with these kinds of things you can

00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:14,270
make pearl that is very testable that is

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:17,750
readable so no pearl is not hard to test

00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:19,279
maintain another thing people will say

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,930
pro/5 is killing pearls

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,850
this was more of an argument a few years

00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:27,379
ago uh when a lot of pro 58 had been

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,459
there for a long time and nothing had

00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:33,769
changed in fact if you go to a lot of

00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:35,360
cloud servers now you get pearl 58

00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:39,350
because no one's bothered to update it

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,930
if anybody here uses any of the Amazon

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:44,300
or services for their clouds call them

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:47,029
up as a as a customer and get pissed

00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:50,360
about the fact that pearl seems to be

00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:52,519
ancient you know the right now on amazon

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,019
58 is the version that isn't supported

00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:55,459
before the version that isn't supported

00:13:54,019 --> 00:14:00,110
before the version that isn't supported

00:13:55,459 --> 00:14:03,050
and they still have it but this is a

00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:06,980
good quote from larry / 05 had started

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:08,870
dying people didn't see it growing they

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,209
didn't see it changing it was sort of

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:15,410
what it was and it was just really not

00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:17,360
that much new to work on it and Perl 6

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:20,689
gave people a chance to think about

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:25,839
pearl 54 about the pearl they used in a

00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:28,279
new way so pearl 6 really is helped it

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,170
how many people here have been in talks

00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:34,220
about new things that are available in

00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:36,800
Perl 5 smart matching and whether you

00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,420
like all of them or not there's a hell

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,990
of a lot that's gone on the core of

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:44,470
pearl has been rewritten it's a lot

00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,759
faster reg axes have been cleaned up

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,589
destructors my link lists I had to go

00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:50,600
through all kinds of weird things to

00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,220
break up these nested structures that

00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,110
now I can just let go out of scope and

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:59,329
they magically clean themselves up 5 10

00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,879
wood was released in two thousand seven

00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:05,059
ten one came out with a lot of bug fixes

00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:08,209
pretty soon after we're now at the point

00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:09,679
where these these even-numbered releases

00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:12,439
that are usable are coming up pretty

00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:16,519
reliably and the bug fixes are going

00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:19,790
through a lot of that came from perl 6

00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,860
and and having to build a language from

00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,480
scratch and design all the tests from

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,800
scratch a lot of that testing get pushed

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:29,420
back into five if you look at this i

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,430
don't know how many core tests are in

00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:35,370
Perl 5 16 x

00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:37,260
it's a lot is I've ever looked at the

00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:44,130
tests with that the T directory in a

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:48,810
pearl district and the number of hmm ok

00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:51,390
well that's a lot of tests and again the

00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,160
the level of testing that goes on a lot

00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:59,570
of that came back from perl 6 and got

00:15:53,160 --> 00:16:03,120
pushed into / 05 the this test Suites

00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:07,920
platform coverage you know I'm not going

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:12,300
to go through all of this but a lot have

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,820
a lot of Perl 5 got more interesting

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,310
with six out there and finding ways to

00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:20,550
backport things finding ways to apply

00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:23,580
what the community had thought of as as

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:26,610
wanted in Perl 6 gave people a new focus

00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:29,790
so it perl 6 really has been good for /

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:32,610
05 so hopefully if anyone brings these

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:35,430
myths up you can throw this back at them

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:38,190
no pearl is not dead it's alive it's

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,720
very testable because of the testing

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,459
it's actually pretty maintainable and

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:46,800
you can make it readable if you wanted

00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:48,450
to there's some some places to go a lot

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,760
of the thing with buzz this is my own

00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:54,450
thing people are worried about pearl in

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,730
the news pearl whatever more important

00:16:54,450 --> 00:17:00,570
than buzz is whether people learn to use

00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:04,230
pearl most universities do not teach

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:06,750
pearl we've just the theoreticians don't

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,520
like it one of the best things you can

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,010
do aside from having an act of perl

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,270
mongers group if there isn't one

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,949
invented just announced that there's a

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,470
perl mongers it's free to join so it's

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,929
not really expensive to start in chicago

00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,150
for years we used to meet a bar walk in

00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:22,559
have a few peers and leave have a few

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,740
viewers talk about pearl do whatever you

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,990
want to if you really feel like you want

00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:30,630
to help pearl call the local community

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,929
college and get paid a hundred bucks to

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,850
teach a roomful of people pearl there's

00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,710
this one weird guy we even wrote a book

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,900
on learning perl that you can use its

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:43,860
they actually took it out of a class on

00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,660
teaching for all hmm so if you just read

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,370
the book out loud

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,110
you may not say like Randall but that

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,750
book is enough to teach people how to

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:55,120
program pearl from scratch it is a class

00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,740
and it's the notes from a bunch of

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,500
people who stand in front of people who

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,240
don't know pearl and teach them try it

00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,350
just run a community college less I'm

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,120
going to read you this book I'll get

00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,700
paid a hundred bucks for it if people

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,710
learn perl they start using it you show

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:12,510
them how to do things with it they're

00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:17,290
going to get more involved oh this is uh

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:19,900
which language makes you happiest and

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:23,590
notice that curveball is pretty low on

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,570
that list but there was a great thing if

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:27,700
in the old pearl journal though it Larry

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,790
wall did a thing on where for out cometh

00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,740
ow if anyone saw that it was on the pain

00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:34,450
scale if you fare to pain you can use

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:39,130
objects and if you're an easy and in

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:43,360
Perl supports both but the driving time

00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:46,840
left a couple of seconds a couple of

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:51,340
things about Pearl six this is a good

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,780
quote but curl six is not pearl it'll

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:57,130
never be finished and there's no code

00:18:52,780 --> 00:19:01,780
written in it the very fast thing is if

00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:04,030
you look this is this is pearl sex for

00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,160
the most part you'd recognize you might

00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:08,640
not understand all of it but you'll tend

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,070
to recognize Pearl six animals like well

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,500
it's it's got extensions it's at various

00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:17,470
improvements it's got syntax changes but

00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:23,620
if you understand / 05 getting into pro

00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:25,030
6 is not that hard um and this is you

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,060
know we had it done on schedule it would

00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:29,860
be crap there's the whole open source

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,660
argument that getting something done

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:36,520
when it's ready is more important than

00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:38,230
just shoving it out the door so the you

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,290
know when it'll be done probably never

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:43,530
what'll pro/5 be done hopefully never it

00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:46,420
won't be done because then it'll be dead

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:50,800
but pearl 6 is growing it is alive

00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:52,600
there's more and more code on it the

00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,670
Rikuo people I guess have got the most

00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,400
advanced version that you can stick on a

00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:59,340
machine and do something with there's a

00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:04,059
lot of it out there

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:07,630
um I don't know what this was for oh

00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:10,690
this was generated with with perl 6 i

00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:12,220
guess there is a lot of perl 6 code out

00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,350
there now it's gotten to the point where

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,169
if you want to try Perl 6 out and play

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:20,289
with it on the weekends these are some

00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:22,570
of the things you can get into if you

00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:24,490
wanted to create a quick and dirty SQL

00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,130
Lite interface try doing in Perl 6 what

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:34,389
the hell there there's stuff out there

00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:36,760
that works bakudo has gotten pretty good

00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:39,090
at cycling through getting new releases

00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,250
getting bug fixes getting things done

00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:44,740
parrot pretty much works there's a I

00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,510
don't know how how good a job they're

00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,710
doing of bringing new languages on to it

00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:55,029
but it supports a heck of a lot of

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:57,370
things and then the real summary is that

00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:59,620
you know aside from the language pearl

00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:02,289
really is Sipan is part of pearl the

00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:04,779
community is on Pearl they all seem to

00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:09,730
be alive and well so the myth that pearl

00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:11,710
is dead or unusable or anything no it

00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,980
isn't and the best thing we can do is

00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,720
just keep using it and there's probably

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,899
no time for questions you probably don't

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:28,899
have me if you're awake anyway so oh

00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:33,850
yeah here's the and I think yeah we're

00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:38,470
done was that useful to anybody say oh

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:40,419
wait that's it how many people here face

00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:43,570
questions like these all we can't use

00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:45,850
pearl for this project is its play it's

00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,070
too complicated i can't find programmers

00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:50,830
nobody out there knows pearl-ear that

00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:53,620
one lately we can't do it in Peru opens

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,029
I can't i already bro programs but if

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,409
you look on Sipan there's enough new

00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:58,210
stuff going in and with this is somebody

00:21:56,409 --> 00:21:59,289
out there it goes pearl or there

00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,980
wouldn't be that many of the things

00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:05,950
going on a sea pen every day so a lot of

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:08,080
these myths I think people accept them

00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,850
because we've heard them so often if you

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,409
get sick at all yeah pipeline but I

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,049
still like it and that's not a good

00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:15,480
enough answer the

00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:18,860
s-series come up with ways to say these

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,539
things to people but the information

00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:25,019
most of those arguments that people use

00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:34,049
our stuff all aside I think I've to tell

00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:36,080
what time i went over okay so okay does

00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:36,080
