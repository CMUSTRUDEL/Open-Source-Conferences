00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,120
delighted to be standing here today at

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:57,700
the largest you have see that we've ever

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:59,410
held in north america and yes i would

00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,150
like to thank JT and his team for the

00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:05,640
amazing job they have done promoting and

00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,640
organizing this conference well done

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,659
CFCs are time when the community comes

00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,730
together to meet face to face we get to

00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:17,980
share our ideas and we dream about the

00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,690
possibilities of a future I'm a

00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,670
volunteer it works for the pearl

00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,070
foundation and at times i find it very

00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,990
hard to stay motivated the winter months

00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,120
are always the hardest but the summer

00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,880
conferences brings such energy and this

00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,160
year is no exception JT wrote a blog

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,390
post about the hackathons and you talked

00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,060
about the sort of things that can be

00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:40,500
creatively ops ii but not only do we

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,940
create code we also develop community

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,820
yelp see is the reason that we have the

00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:48,910
pro foundation it was at a conference

00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,770
like this one in 1999 when a group of

00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,750
people got together and decided to

00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,400
create an organization they would

00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,870
hopefully be able to do some things for

00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,960
the community when they're not meeting

00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,880
face to face in the early days of the

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,800
pearl foundation we carried out

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,720
fundraising so that we could provide

00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,150
grants to pearl people who need no

00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,270
introduction like Larry wall and Damien

00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:12,970
Conway and we still continue to raise

00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:15,849
money for pearl last year in asheville

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,379
at the FC north america i announced the

00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:21,280
creation of the pearl five core

00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:24,459
maintenance fund we had been providing

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,709
money chill idea of mitchell to fix bugs

00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:29,200
in the pro five core but our funding was

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:32,290
running out and we wanted to continue to

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,360
do that and we needed to find it away we

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:37,299
also wanted to fund Nicholas Clarke I'm

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,859
sure some of you have heard of and there

00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:40,930
are very few people in the world who are

00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:42,909
capable at the minute of working on

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,739
five core and Nick had some time

00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:47,349
available and we really wanted to use

00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:50,530
the mummy could the response from the

00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:52,599
Pearl community has been amazing I would

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,430
like to thank everyone who supported us

00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,980
this year financially or with your time

00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,079
and there are far too many volunteers we

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,870
design cool but we would achieve nothing

00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:04,120
without you I would like to thank the

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,280
companies who provided amazing donations

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,040
and in particular the craigslist

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,909
charitable funds who donated 100

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,909
thousand dollars

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:31,800
and also to thank booking.com who

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:33,360
donated 100,000 euros yes to all the

00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,530
companies who two years I would like to

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,200
thank you on behalf of the Pearl

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,820
community for your generosity we also

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,709
receive donations from perl mongers

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,080
groups we receive donations from the

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,000
Vienna perl mongers and from the Oslo

00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,280
problem numbers we have received

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,400
donations from 20g individuals in the

00:03:47,280 --> 00:04:00,180
community seven of who actually do need

00:03:50,400 --> 00:04:02,370
every single month to Perl 5 so not only

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,459
am i sounding at the start of you know

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,200
our biggest yop see in North America I'm

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,000
also standing at the end of a very

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,790
successful year for the pearl foundation

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,239
we managed to rheas 280 2316 dollars for

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,239
pearl five

00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,310
so it's been a fantastic year but I

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,530
don't want that to be the pinnacle of my

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,630
time at the pearl foundation I believe

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,820
in continuous improvement that we can

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,830
always do better so let's see what we

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,600
can do together this year to make it an

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,890
even better year for pearl and for the

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,890
