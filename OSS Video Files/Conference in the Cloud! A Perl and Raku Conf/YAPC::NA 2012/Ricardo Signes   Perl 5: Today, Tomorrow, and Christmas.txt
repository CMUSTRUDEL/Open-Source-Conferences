okay my clock shows ten o'clock I think

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:16,199
we're in here from 10 to 10 50s that

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:20,160
right okay great so I am talking about

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:24,449
Pearl 5 like almost everyone else here

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:29,250
but I am talking about Pearl 5 per se

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:31,830
right pearl 5 itself what's going on how

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,550
does the sausage get made and what are

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,440
we putting into it next but before I

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,530
talk about how we do that I want to talk

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,739
about how we used to do it between pro 5

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,989
10 and pearl 512 we changed the way we

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,440
release Pearl the way the lifestyle

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,640
cycle works and I was really surprised

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,110
when I thought about and realized this

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,289
was three years ago that we made this

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,600
change on the the new way we've been

00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,789
doing for a pretty long time and I'm

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,590
hoping this is like the last time that

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,510
one of these how we make pearl talks

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,729
needs to start by reminding you of the

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,979
lousy old way but I thought it was worth

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,610
doing to show you why we're still

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,619
basically in a state of flux back in the

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,430
old days we had a branch in our

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:20,250
repository called bleed and you would

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,500
make changes to bleed and eventually

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,000
there'd be a release like 58 we released

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,210
pro 58 and everyone is really happy

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,979
because 58 is the best release ever and

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,270
then people keep going on in there

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,549
working in bleed and they make them more

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,700
and more commits and eventually release

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,619
59 and like a lot of projects if a bill

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,170
number is odd it's a development release

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,700
so nobody is supposed to install 59 on

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,970
their servers and you know use it to

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,189
power their banks but we want to keep

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,820
making 58 releases so every once in a

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:53,610
while we bring changes down from bleed

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,960
into mate mate as the maintenance branch

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,930
though that's stable you should be

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,240
installing places and then over time we

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,740
make some more releases right 59 1592

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,140
those guys get me these are just

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,040
development snapshots we see what you

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,360
know what have people been playing

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,509
around with in the development branch

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,330
and we release those and some time later

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,020
we bring in relevant changes now these

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,210
are the songs

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,640
changes right like in bleed we fixed

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,980
some bug there was a bug in Pearl it

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,300
gets fixed and bleed and eventually

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,880
someone says I'm going to release Pearl

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,510
582 and I'm going to bring in that bug

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,610
fix and seven other bug fixes and

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:32,010
eventually much later right we get we

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,250
movement we make 5 10 5 10 has big

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:39,210
changes there are problems with this

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,710
that I'm going to explain bleed needs to

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,600
stay in a working condition all right

00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,430
everyone shares bleed that's where all

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,610
the development happens so if you brake

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,600
bleed you make everyone else unhappy but

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,520
that's where all the work is getting

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,910
done so it's breaking getting fixed and

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:57,240
moving around it's a big moving target

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:59,820
there's lots of churn but the real next

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,340
stable release is going to come from

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,930
maint and anything that you want to get

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,510
into maint like you have a little bug

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,770
fix it needs to go into bleed right and

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,320
work there and then you need to get

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:13,170
somebody to review it make sure it makes

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,170
sense make sure it belongs in maint and

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,630
then cherry pick it down and this became

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,930
known as cherry mate right you've got

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,730
someone whose job it is to go through

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,280
and look at all this stuff in bleed and

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,980
figure out what belongs in stable what

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,660
do we want to bring down and this is a

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,690
lot of work right there's a lot of stuff

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,940
that's going on there and how long is 59

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,050
going to be around we don't know so like

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,490
there's an indefinite amount of time

00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,820
that bug fixes are going through this

00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:43,740
long process and who is doing this work

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,570
the pumpking is doing this work and the

00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,490
pumpking has lots and lots of other jobs

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,980
so we end up with a very sad pumpkin

00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:52,440
who's like sitting there trying to do

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,530
all this work not only to make pearl

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,260
better in general moving into the future

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,510
than doing all this almost

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,120
administrative work right bringing in

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,459
changes from the bleed branch into the

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,290
main branch so that people who just want

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,030
a little better pearl to keep installing

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,239
and upgrading and fixing bugs can get

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,239
them

00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,440
and how do we know when we get these new

00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:19,700
releases how do you know when you get

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,739
592 or 593 how do we know when 510 is

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,660
done how do we know when 58 is done how

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:26,210
would we know when it's time to say now

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:29,450
we get a new release and how do we know

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:32,540
what stuff can go in which what's the

00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:36,560
criteria for saying this bug fix or this

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:39,890
feature can go into 582 because you have

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,460
features that landed in n patch levels

00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:45,350
right 589 added some features 581 added

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,920
a bunch of features how do we decide

00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:50,900
these things um what is a stable release

00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,690
and the answer to basically all these

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,730
questions is well when I say so you know

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,400
it's it's soup when I say it's soup and

00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,500
and that's when it's soup and this is

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,390
not actually the worst idea right you

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,490
can have a project lead who says look I

00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:06,440
am taking very good care of this project

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,300
I'm going to be able to you know it's I

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,060
know it when I see it this is going to

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,310
be done when I know it's done but in

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,530
practice what it led to was really long

00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,600
waits for new features to hit production

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:21,230
so people would implement a bunch of

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,990
features in during 59 and when do they

00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:26,750
actually get released well the answer in

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:29,050
hindsight is not for a long time and the

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,520
answer in foresight was we don't know I

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,040
when is what i wrote a really cool

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,169
feature and not someone someone writes a

00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:40,100
really cool feature you know you get the

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:42,230
defined or operator you get a pluggable

00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,210
regex engines you get new assertion

00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,919
systems or any it's kind of a new

00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,630
feature and you write it you get it into

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,130
bleed pearl you're really excited you

00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,110
know this is going to make your coding a

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,840
lot easier great when can I start using

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:56,120
it at work well 15 10 comes out okay

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,700
what's five tens release date I don't

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,220
know and so you've built this feature

00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,320
and what happens you wander away and you

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,790
don't get to use it when there are bugs

00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,350
found with it you're not around because

00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,610
you know why are you sticking around you

00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,280
did all this work and it's and it's not

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,960
going anywhere and because people are

00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,210
not around to defend these decisions or

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,740
discuss the design and they're not

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,780
testing the code right they're not

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,870
getting the code into production and

00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,310
seeing what it's going to do you end up

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,849
with these bad designs that survived

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,379
through this long process

00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:26,939
because no one knows when they're going

00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:29,249
to go out there's no pressure to debate

00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:32,399
them I wrote this really cool feature

00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:34,349
and I got it in bleed and you know maybe

00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,879
it's going to go into a release well if

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:37,469
the release is coming out really soon

00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,520
there's going to be some pressure to

00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:40,830
figure out whether this is a good idea

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,520
or not but when the release is not

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:45,869
coming out for a couple years I don't

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,469
know you know when it's soup it'll come

00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:50,639
out people don't have a pressure to

00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:52,169
figure out whether this thing needs to

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,689
go in or out they have plenty of

00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:56,159
pressure to argue and argue and argue

00:06:53,689 --> 00:07:02,099
but nobody feels any need to come to a

00:06:56,159 --> 00:07:05,699
decision and even worse the pumpking is

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:07,469
now doing sherry maint doing a release

00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,419
planning right tasting this thing all

00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:11,519
the time and going is it soup yet right

00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:14,279
it is this done do I think this is are

00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,869
we getting ready for 510 doing the

00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,610
release paperwork right so every time

00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,469
you make this development snapshot

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,849
you've got to go through like you got a

00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:22,379
bump release numbers you've got to

00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:23,369
update the pearl delta which is a

00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,349
document that tells you everything

00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:27,899
that's new probably the most tedious

00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:29,430
part of releasing pearl is going through

00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,619
it's a great document but I mean it's

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,610
huge amounts of writing what's going on

00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:36,749
I'm dealing with all the angry people um

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,399
you know like who are telling you you're

00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:39,839
doing the job badly or who say this

00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,309
feature really needs to go in or this

00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,819
feature justin is I can't be allowed to

00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:46,529
go in and um who's doing this it's the

00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,689
pumpkin and remember we're talking about

00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:50,129
the bad old days um and who is the

00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:53,009
pumpkin at that time well it ends up

00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:55,469
being really really valuable coding

00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:59,069
resources right among the pumpkins of

00:07:55,469 --> 00:08:05,159
these days were chips all Zandberg nick

00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:07,529
clark Rafael Hugo Dave Mitchell people

00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:11,069
who are like seriously really really

00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:15,869
good poor wow pork roll programmers

00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:17,129
court pro programmers and and what are

00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,419
you doing you're taking these guys who

00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,649
are your best programming assets and

00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,029
you're saying by the way can you do like

00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:24,659
all this paperwork and manage some

00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:26,219
people and it right it's just it's just

00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:27,929
the worst thing you could do and you end

00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:29,699
up with these really really angry people

00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:31,559
who don't like you get bitter and it's

00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,990
I've had more than one person tell me

00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:35,599
I've seen a lot of people take on the

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,610
pumpking job and just become big

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,610
angry individuals and I really hope it

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,409
doesn't happen to you well what it ended

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:46,430
up happening not to me what might have

00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:49,160
happened was during 510 was we ended up

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:52,639
with no pumpkin because the pumpkin quit

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,819
he said like this this is not worth my

00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:57,350
time the abuse and the stress it's not

00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:58,459
it's not going anywhere that I

00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,569
appreciate and we ended up with no

00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:03,380
pumpkin we didn't know what we're going

00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:05,899
to do it's a bad state and there's a big

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,459
meeting and phone call in San Diego das

00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,680
kann kind of like figuring out what was

00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:13,269
going to do the phrase was uttered i

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:18,170
really wish i had a coffee mug on and

00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:20,690
and what ends up happening is jesse

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,819
vincent and others start pushing for the

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:26,120
idea at this meeting has been pushed for

00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:30,800
many times in the past that we're going

00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:33,170
to start doing regular releases we're

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,209
going to do time boxed releases of pearl

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,319
every month we'll get a new development

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,350
pearl out we're stealing this from

00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:40,730
parrot and every once in a while we

00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,500
don't know how long yet we're going to

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:43,639
do a stable release of pearl and how do

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,790
you know it's soup well because it's

00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:48,800
been cooking for a year and the other

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,990
point was we want to make sure any idiot

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,029
can release Pearl right releasing pearl

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,310
is not the job of your best technical

00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:57,699
resource releasing pearl is the job of

00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:01,399
somebody who wants to help out and

00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:04,880
things start looking like this so we do

00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:06,649
a release of 5 15 0 this is a few years

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,360
later but they all look the same which

00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:16,459
is a great sign we do 515 zero in june

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:19,459
months later 15 1 15 to 15 3 right every

00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:22,970
month you get pearl now it's not always

00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:25,130
a great pearl sometimes it's crazy

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,870
busted on some platforms and those weird

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,610
bugs but this is the development branch

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,350
you expect that but we give you a

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,120
snapshot to refer to and figure out

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,639
what's going on and we see the progress

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,279
of pearl as it goes along and eventually

00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,680
as we go on we are reducing the number

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,860
of changes you can get in we're bringing

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,230
pearl in for a landing pearl is going to

00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,089
release 516 at some point and we want

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:50,339
516 to be stable and good and not

00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,809
crazy busted bugs so we say a little

00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:57,389
less please a little less please and

00:10:51,809 --> 00:11:01,199
pretty soon we bring out 516 and 516 has

00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:03,389
one year of changes close to exactly and

00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:06,680
has been carefully managed and we know

00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:08,819
if your feature is going to go in or not

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,459
you write your feature and you know

00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:15,029
either this feature will be out within a

00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:17,309
year and if it's not I can get back to

00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:18,629
it it'll be out within the next year so

00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,980
you're going to be able to find out when

00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:22,680
your feature is coming out and it makes

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:27,660
pearl very predictable and immediately

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:29,699
after 5 16 0 comes out 575 17-0 comes

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,680
out and we go back onto the same thing

00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:35,220
and it's repeats year after year and if

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,420
you go back to 5 11 1 I think that's

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,459
when the pattern begins and it has

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,459
continued straight through now for three

00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:43,529
years without I think the biggest delay

00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:45,089
we had was maybe two days one day

00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:47,519
something came out on the twenty-second

00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:49,319
instead of the 20th of the month which i

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,439
think is a pretty impressive record and

00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:54,629
what's even better is the releases

00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:58,350
aren't done by nick clark they're not

00:11:54,629 --> 00:12:00,809
done by chip they're being done by

00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,129
people who are not the absolute the

00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:03,929
people who get burned out doing it and

00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:07,139
much more importantly they're not the

00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:08,759
same person every time here's the people

00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:10,699
who did releases right Dave golden did

00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:12,720
one Zefram did too i did a couple

00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:14,009
stephen little Abigail they're all

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,720
getting done by different people who

00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:17,069
aren't going to burn out and you can

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,870
bring different perspectives and say

00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:22,079
this was the part that annoyed me Wars

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,220
so I automated that part and every part

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,189
of the release gets easier and easier

00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,509
over time which means that we're much

00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:29,819
more likely to stick to the schedule

00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:31,949
over time it's been a huge success this

00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:34,769
has been this is the bleed branch this

00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:37,499
is how we release development pearl and

00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:40,829
eventually the end goal of a development

00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:44,370
cycle like 515 is to get to a production

00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:46,679
cycle like 516 and that's when we get to

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,300
the maint branch maintenance pearl you

00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:49,850
probably only want to install stuff

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:54,300
that's on a maintenance branch and

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:58,259
here's how that works so I released 516

00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:00,819
a couple weeks ago and in about a week

00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:02,919
or two I release 516 one

00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:05,229
and that's just going to be the things

00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:08,019
that we couldn't quite get into the

00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:10,059
release window for 5 16 0 or the few

00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:13,359
bugs that have popped up in the in the

00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:15,369
meantime and so people who setting up

00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:17,079
well I'm not going to install pearl

00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:19,559
until the dot one release out is out

00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:22,329
because those dot 0 releases are twitchy

00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,739
it totally reasonable especially because

00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:26,169
you're going to get your dot one release

00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:27,819
really quickly you know it gets released

00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:29,410
people start installing it and the

00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:31,689
people who didn't test the the dev

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,579
versions find the weird bugs because

00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:35,919
they're doing crazy stuff and they

00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:39,429
report them and we fix them to give you

00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:43,749
an example 5 10 1 is something like 18

00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:46,720
months between 5 10 0 and 5 10 15 8 1

00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:49,389
similarly big big window and serious

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,160
changes going on here via this nice

00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:52,799
tight little window a small number of

00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,529
changes that are all defined as being

00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:59,049
critical bug fixes and then we're going

00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:02,769
to get 5 16 to a while later not a few

00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:05,049
weeks but a few months later and 5 16 2

00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:09,279
or 5 16 3 that should be a three on

00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:12,369
there much later in fact we haven't even

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,959
released 5 14 3 the things we want to

00:14:12,369 --> 00:14:19,929
get in there but they have so far been

00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:21,509
such low priority and so few serious

00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:24,399
serious bugs that we need to see fixed

00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:26,829
that um it hasn't gotten pressured into

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,329
coming out we want to get it out we only

00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:30,039
out of the door but we've we've

00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:31,959
redefined the nature of these

00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:34,269
maintenance branches to be you get what

00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:37,389
you get at point zero and then you get

00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:39,459
little tiny improvements to fix critical

00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:42,069
bugs or to fix speed regressions things

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,959
like that and if you want changes and

00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:45,639
features you have to wait for the next

00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,159
release but that's cool cuz it's only a

00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,019
year away that's our minimal maintenance

00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,970
branch all the development is kept and

00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,829
bleed the rules about changing

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,449
maintenance are really strict it has to

00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:57,970
be a critical bug fixed or look security

00:14:55,449 --> 00:15:00,009
and it's been so effective this is the

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,179
problem well this is not the problem

00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:02,470
this is a good part that so affected

00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:07,570
that now we maintain to maintenance

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:11,650
branches 516 and 514 are both

00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:12,880
actively maintained meaning we will

00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:16,180
continue to do releases and bug fixes

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,860
for those as we get them so there's more

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,660
people doing the releases spreading that

00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,850
work out the person who's doing the

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,760
maintenance stuff is supposed to be me

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:28,420
and i can tell you i am not the most

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,060
valuable see programmer in p 5 p I don't

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,770
do see it all so there's there's no

00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:36,730
chance of me being distracted from from

00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:38,920
fixing pearls pearls of C code and we

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,720
can maintain multiple maintain versions

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,090
where you can stick to whichever one you

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,430
started with for a longer period of time

00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:47,110
and that makes me very happy pumpkin I

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:50,050
don't have to do all this horrible

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,580
horrible paper well I do the horrible

00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,870
horrible paperwork and people who don't

00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,550
want to do the paperwork don't have to

00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,280
do it and we get pearl out more often

00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:01,030
and we get a better pearl out the

00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:04,750
problem is in theory this will be

00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:06,820
happening right the little orange guys

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,710
bringing in those critical bug fixes

00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,440
that we figure out we still do cherry

00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,700
mate where we still say fixes are going

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,860
to go into bleed and then we bring them

00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:17,950
back but the idea is we bring back way

00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,930
way fewer of them and when we turn that

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,670
number down like it was said it 11 we're

00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:24,760
bringing everything that we accidentally

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,980
turned it to zero and like me it's kind

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,420
of not happening right now and it's not

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,400
that those critical bugs waiting to get

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:34,150
fixed for the most part for the most

00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:37,180
part our policies on how to get

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:39,190
maintenance release is done have been

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,610
maybe too strict and the person who's

00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:44,920
doing these maintenance releases me um

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,840
I'm not always competent technically to

00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,610
say we've got these three bug fixes to

00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,500
bring back but oops they conflict and

00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,120
they were requested by different people

00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,740
who aren't interested in the other bugs

00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,870
and we need to force these people to

00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,130
work together to make the bugs work

00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,650
together so this is the problem we're

00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:01,990
still figuring out but the problem of

00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:03,970
getting back you're sort of like third

00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:07,180
level of bug fixes because we've got 5

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,860
14 1 and 5 14 to getting that third tier

00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,800
of bug fixes that haven't been found for

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,990
nine months if that's the problem you

00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,430
have or the old problem was we don't

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,920
release a new version of pearl for five

00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:20,890
years that's it's pretty good progress

00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,510
um okay so

00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,650
I keep talking about the pumpking and

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:28,570
I'm gonna talk about what the pumpking

00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:30,010
is back in the everybody for the story

00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:33,340
million times but I'm contractually

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:35,830
obliged to tell it on a long time ago

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:39,760
chips all Zinberg its thing of his chip

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:41,800
some dude worked at a place where they

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,390
needed to control who would be touching

00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,430
the source code and they didn't have a

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,670
version control system so the version

00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:50,080
control system was a stuffed pumpkin and

00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,400
whoever had the pumpkin right he's like

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,010
the kid on the island with the conch

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,420
he's the only person who can do stuff

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,850
and if you want to change stuff you go

00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,690
through him he's the beloved benevolent

00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:03,520
dictator for now he can do everything

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,920
and in the past he was the person who

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,680
could do everything you know you had the

00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,140
punking who was the the technical lead

00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,600
the best programmer and the person who

00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,680
through whom all things went but we

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,570
already talked about the problems and

00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,900
now the pumpkin is the guy who manages

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:22,870
the project the person through whom

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,490
decisions are vetted who make sure the

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,690
releases get out on time who make sure

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,900
someone is scheduled to do the next

00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,910
release it is in many ways a management

00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,750
and administration job I'm going to talk

00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,910
about the ways it's not an

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,020
administration job but there are there

00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:37,030
are many significant ways in which

00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,970
that's what it is and the last two

00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,620
pumpkins pumpkins have been me and Jesse

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,040
Vincent who very sadly couldn't be here

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:47,020
this year Jesse not get along really

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,940
well and I think that we both want

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,630
what's good for Pearl five and we mostly

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:54,520
agree on what that is but we look at the

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,170
future in very different ways on how

00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,480
many people here saw Jesse's talk last

00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:01,120
year ok yeah it's a bunch that's a bunch

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,800
of people um when Jesse talks about the

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,600
future and I think really when Jesse

00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,310
thinks about the future right he sees

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,130
like this glorious world of tomorrow

00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,780
where everything has been built up into

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,890
this this perfectly well done thing

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,080
everything's getting better and better

00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:18,280
and better and that's our destiny that's

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,350
not how I see the future I I always

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,120
imagining the worst thing that could

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:25,090
possibly happen and that is how I plan

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,220
all of my my technical decisions and my

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:29,470
software engineering and so he was

00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,390
talking last year about what his hopes

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,710
and dreams were and how like we're going

00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,570
to go into this bright future and I

00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,670
couldn't I couldn't

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,930
myself to do that kind of thing is not

00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,790
my nature so the things I'm going to

00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:42,270
talk about are like my fears and

00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:43,950
anxieties about what our problems are

00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:47,070
and how we can address them and how we

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,720
can have a a realistic view of the

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,830
horrible future into which we're marking

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,120
and how we can make it less horrible

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:55,550
because I think that there is hope as

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,550
long as we are always always terrified

00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:06,750
yeah right um so I'm an American this is

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:10,050
this how we are um so um so I right so I

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:12,210
want to talk about how I snow yeah how I

00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,220
see the job and not just like how I see

00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,200
the job is I get to be a dictator which

00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,730
is cool but you know what my

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,500
responsibilities are to pearl and I

00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,770
think the most important thing is my job

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,180
is not to make sure pearl gets better my

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:28,080
job is to make sure a pearl doesn't get

00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:30,810
any worse because like does that mean on

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,160
the language designer will know only

00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:37,050
only to the extent that if I offer a

00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:38,880
design someone carries it out if I if I

00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,730
just you know show this is how it's

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,960
going to work and I say make it so and

00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:47,910
no one carries it out IM not my language

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,230
designer position is not doing that much

00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:52,560
and like i said i'm not a sea programmer

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:56,130
I'm not in this to write pearl I'm in it

00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,630
to to take care of pearl um the crew

00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:59,700
right on the enterprise they're getting

00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,200
paid or something I don't know they're

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,120
getting a lot no matter how it works but

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,130
good like they've got a reason to be

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,190
there and it's not just like the uniform

00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,510
on the to the extent that those crew

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,220
aren't getting paid right they're just

00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:14,460
doing whatever they want and the people

00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:16,350
who are the heroes of pro/5 porters the

00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,850
people who are fixing pearl bugs and

00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:21,870
writing pearl features and making pearl

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:25,230
go I don't pay them even the ones who

00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:28,230
get paid I don't really get to I'm not

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:31,530
their boss I I'm an organizer and a

00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:33,750
coordinator so there's no direct

00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:36,120
monetary motivation for people to do

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,580
what I tell them to do Tom not make it

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,930
so was here already but with Shorin

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,920
talking about what kind of captain you

00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:45,360
are this is this is my captain geek code

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,370
I'm probably Picard but i really wish i

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,900
was cisco and i had

00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,340
make this up because they're in a geek

00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,610
code there's nothing about which star

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,380
trek captain you are which struck me is

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:58,250
unbelievable so this is my proposed

00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:01,140
extension will be in the RFC soon um

00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:04,800
anyway so that the pumpkins job is not

00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:06,090
to design although i do like designing

00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,460
features and explaining what i think

00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:12,150
about them the problem is that the job

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:16,200
is to be the decider to figure out which

00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:19,020
things are going to happen every once in

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,970
a while but especially about 18 months

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,370
of there have been discussions about how

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,900
a bill becomes a law well if i write it

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,059
changed a pearl how do i know it's going

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,260
to go in well the way it should work is

00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:30,570
will have a list of acceptance criteria

00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,580
and if i follow the procedure and I I

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:33,900
meet every other acceptance criteria I

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,929
will have a change to pearl that will be

00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,309
released um and you know the idea is

00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:40,110
we've we've built a system by which

00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:44,010
everyone can understand how to change

00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:45,780
pearl I really don't like this idea and

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:49,710
it's not because I'm afraid of losing my

00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:52,080
supreme dictatorial power it's that the

00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,520
way pro gets better isn't by having you

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,460
know Robert's Rules of Order it's by

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,920
figuring out what the where pearl needs

00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,679
to go and that's that's a question of

00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,450
looking at the language design and

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:06,000
figuring out what is best for a pearl on

00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:08,790
a case-by-case basis it's a it's a

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,400
question for consensus based on analysis

00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:14,160
of the technical issues not of following

00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,179
a procedure a procedure is nice for some

00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,870
things but here it doesn't it doesn't

00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:21,750
cut the mustard um mark Dominus did a

00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:25,380
talk years ago called mailing list judo

00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:27,960
and it's it's a great talk I don't know

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,429
if you can find anymore and I got to

00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:35,160
convince him to like publicly release

00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:38,400
the video it talks about how do you get

00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,720
your changes into pearl and in hit in

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,850
his talk the reason it's called mailing

00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,809
list judo it's about how to convince the

00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:49,050
people on pro/5 porters to commit your

00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:51,300
change because the way you get your

00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:54,600
stuff into pearl is not by going through

00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,550
a policy set of documents it's by having

00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,929
your patch applied right how do you get

00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,740
your pack into pearl well someone

00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:01,630
commits it and pushes

00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,580
that's that's the fundamental answer and

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,429
how do you get someone to do that well

00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:08,050
the answer is avoiding controversy the

00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:10,809
positive way to spin this is by reaching

00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:13,780
consensus but this is a sneaky answer

00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:16,030
right you avoid controversy at least on

00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,860
the list and there are a lot of kinds of

00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:21,250
controversy on the list how how do

00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:25,140
features become contentious one of them

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:30,190
is syntax right Pope programmers are

00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:31,510
obsess obsess over syntax and sometimes

00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,720
they'll be busy obsessing over its

00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:36,970
syntax when the problem is the semantics

00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,870
right so the best excellent example

00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:40,350
although I got to tell you there's

00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:43,240
thousands of these examples is this guy

00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:46,200
this is an operator that came up on p5p

00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,360
it's got a bunch of spellings and

00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,160
there's enormous enormous threads about

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,530
how to spell it right well it should

00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,420
probably you know have two matching

00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:57,309
markers it but it should be able to look

00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,480
correct if you put space around it but

00:24:57,309 --> 00:24:59,650
it shouldn't look like you can put a

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,720
space in the middle because people will

00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,250
try that and it goes on it and

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,050
discussing the syntax I'm all for

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,600
discussing syntax I am a pro program I

00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,429
obsess over it but the problem with this

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,679
feature is not the syntax it's the

00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:16,540
semantics are totally not understood so

00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,700
like you can figure out whether you want

00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,290
to spell it this way or that but having

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,940
100 messages arguing about that when the

00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:24,610
feature might be totally crazy no matter

00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,230
how you spell it was maybe you

00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,850
should just stop you know just give up

00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,370
on the future I'm so letting these

00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:34,240
syntax discussions to start at the wrong

00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:37,330
time is like fatal and there's people

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,890
who object to changing anything and the

00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,240
example mark has I want to get an audio

00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,679
snippet but I don't I don't know how to

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,420
do that stuff so I will give you my

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:48,400
impression of mark Dominus I hope he's

00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:51,790
not watching hi mark he says he's

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,470
reading from a god I hope fictional male

00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,760
in this example in which someone you

00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:57,070
know says I found a bug in the +

00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,320
operator you know say 2+2 and it's

00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:02,260
giving me five well you may be correct

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,870
that the results of two plus two should

00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:07,120
be five but it is too late to make that

00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:09,530
change lots of code in production

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:14,240
including some of mine relies on

00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:16,490
behavior and you know so we can't change

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,350
anything we can't fix anything I think

00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,690
the real example he gave is you know

00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,160
something said found too many / ends and

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,750
someone said well you know it should

00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,950
probably be parenthesis because prends

00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,140
is an award if you're not a native

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,810
speaker you can't find it well if you

00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,400
are string matching on the warning week

00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:35,920
someone might be looking for the

00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,920
misspelling of the word / ends with a Z

00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:43,940
and then you get this other for this

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,950
other forms of these these arguments

00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,900
that occur like I really like your new

00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:52,450
feature I really like the way you know

00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:55,760
you've added a new overload for doing

00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,990
exponentiation um but I was kind of

00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,250
thinking that we should probably a while

00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,130
we're doing this pact let's add in some

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:03,410
complex number support and maybe if we

00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,750
put in some support for dumping your

00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:09,440
your complex number as a JPEG that would

00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:10,970
really make this feature complete or the

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,400
people who say you know I've looked at

00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,840
your code and it's crap it doesn't go

00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,950
into pearl there's lots and lots of

00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:21,410
serious bugs the end okay look what were

00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:24,940
they can you help me fix your gone now

00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,570
so in reality these are these are real

00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,850
observations right these are these are

00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:32,090
things that happen on the list and it

00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:34,760
makes marks a partly tongue-in-cheek

00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,380
advice in that talk ring true which is

00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,170
the best way to get it in is to lobby

00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,520
the pumpking and private right like like

00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,870
you know call me over give me a case of

00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,380
beer and saying I got this new feature i

00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:47,540
really wanna get into pearl because you

00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,090
want to avoid this long-running p5p

00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,800
thread because p5p the pro/5 porters

00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,710
mailing list can be a horrible horrible

00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:58,370
place to spend your day um when I became

00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:00,170
punking I started reading every message

00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,190
that goes 2 p-5 p i used to like you

00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:03,830
know i'd read the first three and go

00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:07,250
kill thread and now i read them all in

00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:10,190
man I know I these guys and a bitter it

00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,720
circus lots of angriness but the other

00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:14,360
thing about these arguments and these

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:18,080
things that go on is that they're the

00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,640
crap you know they they they don't have

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,780
any merit you know they're a lot of

00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,790
these arguments that occurred not it not

00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:25,820
everything I said is always crap but

00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:27,230
a lot of the arguments that occur don't

00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,000
have any merit they don't bring anything

00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,160
to pearl having those discussions

00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,770
doesn't make pearl better it makes p5p

00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:37,280
worse and that is the opposite of

00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:41,390
helping pearl on p5p has a culture of

00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:42,980
fear I used to work in quality and right

00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,870
Deming if you guys know Demi he says one

00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,400
of your main goals is to eliminate a

00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:49,520
culture of fear that's what Pearl has

00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:54,020
and specifically p5p as a culture of

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,330
fear of endless horrible argument on so

00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,580
if the discussion on profile Porter's

00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:01,190
was not only reliably civil but

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:03,350
technically on point right talking about

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:05,900
the actual technical issues and sticking

00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:08,630
to them people would want to engage in

00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:11,210
it right it would be a honor and a joy

00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,340
and a privilege to say I believe I have

00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,410
found a way to make pro/5 better please

00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,090
tell me what you think well if you get a

00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,820
technical analysis people would keep a

00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,440
civil tongue in their mouth we'd still

00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,540
try to avoid controversy in what we

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,790
accept into pearl but we'd be reaching

00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:28,700
is we'd be avoiding controversy with

00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:31,310
consensus right figuring out what we

00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,890
think not by buying me a case of beer

00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:35,180
you can still buy me a case of beer but

00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:39,200
I'm going to drink it while i read the

00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:41,060
mailing list thread and the the benefit

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,140
here is that then the pumpking never

00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:46,670
needs to make a decision because p5p

00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,280
comes to a consensus and everybody most

00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:50,510
more or less agrees um so what am I

00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,560
going to do with all that free time what

00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:54,530
I want to do with all the time that i'm

00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,630
not making decisions um is i want to

00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:57,800
keep improving the list culture so the

00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,390
thing that i really want to do and i

00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:03,770
promise i'm going to do more and more

00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:05,630
until I put in disgust in which I met my

00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:09,740
goal is to not quit and discuss its to

00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:11,390
win the lottery and retire is I want to

00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,790
spend my time calling out unreason

00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:16,490
politely calling out unreasonable

00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:18,350
arguments and unreasonable behavior you

00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,290
know when people on the list are arguing

00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:22,430
about something seven orders removed

00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:25,010
that has nothing to do with the feature

00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:28,130
I want to make sure I tell myself to

00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:31,190
tell them give it give it a rest now

00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,810
like this this is not relevant to

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:36,230
figuring out what's good for Pearl and

00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:39,110
worse when it comes with a

00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:42,020
you weren't such an idiot just you like

00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:44,299
you guys need to stop it's not it's not

00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:47,660
good for Pearl and it's when you read

00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:50,000
every one of those messages it's brutal

00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,340
I mean it's just to see how angry people

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,309
are and enter all people who want to

00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:58,040
probe be better and who want to be part

00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:59,900
of the community right p 5 p is a

00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,610
community but it's a it's a

00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,500
dysfunctional one and i think it's one

00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,870
we can make better if we all just pay

00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,030
attention to like other people have

00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:10,309
feelings I mean I know I know you didn't

00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,809
all come here to talk about feelings so

00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:14,179
I'm going to get off this but I really

00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:16,460
think that I really think that that when

00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:18,260
you want to contribute to pearl it's not

00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,240
just about contributing with your code

00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,950
it's about contributing with your

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,110
ability to be a decent human being and

00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,480
in fact I will go so far as to say my

00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:28,700
contribution to pearl is not my code I'm

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,650
an okay coder it's Dean being a decent

00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,059
human being and the more people who are

00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:33,980
willing to do that the better the code

00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:35,780
will be because more people will want to

00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,980
come to pearl and say I'm dude i'm

00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,809
working on pro because those guys are

00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,980
pretty great like there's all kinds of

00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:42,049
people over there they're interesting

00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,980
and they don't yell at each other you

00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:45,470
know they don't they don't tell each

00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,640
other to go screw off um that's that's

00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:52,700
that's what I that's what I want to

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:54,200
bring the pearl yeah thank you so so my

00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,360
job isn't to make sure that pearl gets

00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,490
better I'm not here to put features in

00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,620
the pearl it's to make sure that p 5 p

00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,720
culture gets better that's that is what

00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,970
i want to do and i think p by p culture

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,710
will echo out to the rest of pearl but I

00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:09,679
got to limit myself to one one horrible

00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:11,630
place at a time okay so that's enough

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,240
about feelings um let's talk some more

00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:18,049
about about code sometimes even if you

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,809
have a long focused civil conversation

00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:23,690
you still end up with controversy um not

00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:26,000
not anger you know notnot vitriol and

00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,620
hatred but you know you just don't know

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,520
whether it's a good idea people disagree

00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:33,080
and um the my priority here when we when

00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,820
we get gotten to loggerheads and we

00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,299
don't know what to do is to still not

00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:39,860
have to decide because it's hard so the

00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:42,140
first the first question about how can I

00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,660
not decide whether this belongs in pearl

00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:47,309
can we put it on Sipan

00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,110
if someone people come in a lot to

00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:50,520
provide porters and say I've implemented

00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:53,760
this feature and I want to put it into

00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,530
pearl and it is a very mixed reaction

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,210
like well that sounds good but maybe it

00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:58,760
should do this and I'm not sure how this

00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,290
will scale it interact with other stuff

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,260
can you implement it in a Sipan module

00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:06,809
can you write that and often the answer

00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:09,360
is no you know it's I would but I can't

00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:12,830
and maybe that's the thing to fix in

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,740
pearl we want to focus more not on

00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:19,799
adding stuff to pearl per se adding

00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,870
adding new features but in adding the

00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:24,330
ability to do more stuff outside of

00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:26,490
pearl right if they sit pearl is the

00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,110
syntax in Sipan is the language we want

00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:30,570
to make that even more true I put more

00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:32,520
of the language into Sipan stuff that

00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:35,490
looks like sin taxes or make it so that

00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:37,559
pearl is the architecture and Sipan is

00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:39,090
the syntax and the language it's not

00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:41,400
going to be universal but the more stuff

00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:43,770
we can do outside of core the more

00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,780
experimentation we can do to figure out

00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,520
whether the idea is a good one does this

00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,070
belong in corporal I don't know yet but

00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,330
we can find out bye-bye disseminated to

00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:55,320
people and letting you figure it out

00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:58,290
yourself and if we can't um if we can't

00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,059
a fix pearl to make it more extensible

00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,980
to build your feature maybe we can

00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:03,630
simulate the semantics right well you

00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,630
want this new operator that's going to

00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:08,340
do this thing and implementing the

00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,810
operator is tough but can we make like

00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,879
can you write a module that just does

00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:13,770
that with a function okay it's slower

00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:15,810
and it looks dumb but you write it and

00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,639
now we can use it all over the place or

00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,440
you can use it all over the place and I

00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,840
guarantee you from from personal

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,940
experience many times you will realize

00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,290
that this design you are so sure of you

00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,810
start using in practice and you will

00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:30,810
hate it and what happens there is you

00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:32,040
have just saved pearl from getting this

00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:36,840
thing into it that a year later you'll

00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:38,669
you'll be sorry for um sorry um this is

00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,770
um this is one of the reasons we now

00:34:38,669 --> 00:34:43,919
have feature right you've seen use

00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:47,669
feature say use feature a current sub

00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,710
use feature FC um we want to try hiding

00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:51,359
things behind feature if you can't make

00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,590
it extensible and we really want to

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,470
figure out whether it belongs in pearl

00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:57,420
we can hide it behind feature feature

00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,820
isn't just for stuff that we want to

00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,200
make

00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,210
part of the core language right now

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,930
that's what we've used it for so far

00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:07,360
like you get FC or current sub if you

00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:08,560
say use 516 those features turn on

00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,720
because we think they belong in the

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,520
language that's we've decided that but

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,080
we can have features that aren't in a

00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,890
version like what if we write a feature

00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,120
for a binding operator which some new

00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,980
operator that's going to let you do

00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,180
lexical aliases or you know whatever

00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,890
we're going to make a new operator that

00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,210
automatically adds the next largest

00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:27,760
prime number to your existing prime

00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,960
number because that's really useful we

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,640
don't know whether that belongs in the

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,710
core language but we have to do it in

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,480
the core language for whatever reason we

00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,880
can stick it behind a feature you have

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,920
to explicitly asked for it and later we

00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,540
can take it away and you will know it's

00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,810
going to get taken away because when you

00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:45,430
say use prime operator it use a use

00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,140
feature prime operator it's going to say

00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,320
by by the way man that operators going

00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:51,460
away because we decided it was dumb and

00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,990
we can hunt it not only behind use

00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,600
feature but we've been talking about use

00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:58,000
experimental I want some behavior I know

00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,680
it's experimental i'm declaring i'm

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,540
using this crazy thing that might go

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,970
away it's really cool man i really want

00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,620
it on anything that we shove in there x

00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,280
basically acts just like feature it

00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:10,600
might even just be a facade over feature

00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,850
but it lets us say look I want this

00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,830
operator and it's going to work for now

00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:17,800
but later you're going to start getting

00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:19,120
a warning and finally it's going to say

00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,100
yeah you know you're trying to use that

00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,110
experimental operator it's gone your

00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,400
code will die you need to go fix it it's

00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:27,610
gone we're really sorry it was a dumb

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:33,160
idea um so these are all the strategies

00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:36,100
let us not change pearl permanently the

00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:39,010
strategy of last resort is that we've

00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,510
got to change when its controversial and

00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:43,570
it can't be prototyped on Sipan and it

00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:44,950
can't really go into future I can't go

00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,080
into experimental so how are we going to

00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,790
decide because we've reached the

00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,410
strategy of last resort which is you can

00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:54,010
change pearl or I really change what

00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:55,960
pearl is going to do um so now I have to

00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:57,550
make a decision then I'm going to tell

00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,630
you guys how I how I look at these

00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:03,280
decisions the feature has to has to be

00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:05,860
some of these things or I look at these

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,860
questions is it small and specific or we

00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:11,500
are we adding one simple well-defined

00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,300
behavior that doesn't seem like it

00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,770
plies lots of other stuff right this one

00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:18,490
small simple thing that has a lot of

00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:19,870
value that's good is it is it a generic

00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:24,010
feature that touches things all over the

00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:26,320
place but is um consistent unsurprising

00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:28,720
you can look at it and know what it's

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:32,590
going to do in many contexts and it's

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:35,650
it's going to make sense that's good is

00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:38,710
it teachable for me this is this is a

00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:41,380
really huge one I started writing

00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:43,750
summaries during 405 tens run up to

00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,490
release for my local prolonged us group

00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,930
about the new features I found a couple

00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:49,660
of these features where I realized I

00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:52,840
can't explain these two people on what

00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,220
is the assertion subsystem do I I want

00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,840
you to try and teach that to someone and

00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:58,630
then tell me how to teach it because I'm

00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,920
predicting you can't and it turns out no

00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,570
one could figure out how to explain the

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,940
thing so you ripped it out it didn't

00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,680
make five ten smart match is a similar

00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:09,880
kind of feature I in all my talks I have

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:12,760
to back on smart match teaching how

00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,350
smart max really works is incredibly

00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,850
difficult and that tells me it's a bad

00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,860
feature but if I look at a thing and I

00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,810
can realize this feature looks

00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,170
complicated it's got six moving parts

00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:24,610
but I can explain it in two sentences

00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,900
that's a really good sign there's other

00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:28,930
questions like you know does it have

00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:31,360
value as useful but but this is a good

00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:33,130
one um what's the maintenance burden

00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,900
people want to bring in things that are

00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:37,540
small they do almost nothing you know

00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,460
they only make a small change but the

00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,530
change behind the scenes is big and the

00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,570
person who's making this change you know

00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,860
they're not going to be around forever

00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:48,640
so they're increasing the cost of

00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:50,320
maintaining pearl forever when you have

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,230
a high maintenance costs on a project

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,910
like pearl that has very few really

00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,440
reliable core contributors reliables

00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,910
there are really prolific core

00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,820
contributors who work on every part of

00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:02,260
the system you have to be dangerous

00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,430
about increasing the maintenance Burton

00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,840
in fact I think a lot of what we're

00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:07,120
trying to do now is decrease decrease

00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,040
decrease the maintenance burden both so

00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,260
that pearl is maintainable forever and

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,150
so that new people who come in don't

00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,060
have to pick up all of the the cruft

00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:17,320
that's been there for a long time and

00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:21,239
the final question for me is does it

00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:23,650
make pearl feel more pearl ish

00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:25,989
some of the other questions all I'll

00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,749
boil down into this one and and so this

00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:30,819
is the question I'm really asking myself

00:39:27,749 --> 00:39:33,069
you've proposed to change to pearl does

00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:35,319
it make it more like pearl or does it

00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:38,739
just add stuff and I you know I don't

00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:40,119
have the quote here but is um making

00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:41,499
something more like pearl doesn't mean

00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:44,229
you can't be stealing from Python or

00:39:41,499 --> 00:39:47,829
Ruby in fact i would suggest maybe the

00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:49,269
opposite stealing from anybody you want

00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:51,459
is probably a good sign that you're

00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:55,029
being pretty pearl ish as long as you've

00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:56,349
translated it into pearl so what is /

00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:59,289
lushness well you know I know it when I

00:39:56,349 --> 00:40:01,689
see it on and and that's how I look at

00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:03,069
it and it's this is the only extent to

00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:06,999
which i will say i'm doing language

00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:09,519
design if i look at a change and I look

00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:11,199
at what we have and I think about what

00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:12,519
it means that we have pearl and what

00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:14,679
does this mean to change that it's very

00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:16,269
fuzzy but that's that I think is where

00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:17,529
it boils down to be making a decision

00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:19,869
this is part of why I don't want to make

00:40:17,529 --> 00:40:22,299
these decisions because when I have to

00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:25,140
make the decision um and there isn't

00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:28,479
already a close to a broad consensus I

00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:29,829
am declaring that the way I feel about

00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:32,109
pearl is the way everyone should feel

00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:35,109
about pearl which is absolutely one why

00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:36,549
what I want to avoid doing the other way

00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:37,839
people can talk about Pearl ishness as

00:40:36,549 --> 00:40:40,059
well something is more polish if it

00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,349
moves us along our road map the road map

00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:43,779
of the future of pearl so what's the

00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:45,099
road map I don't make a road map but why

00:40:43,779 --> 00:40:47,650
would I make a road map I don't

00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:49,989
implement pearl I can make a road map of

00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:51,759
like here are the 18 features that pearl

00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,169
will get in the next two years they will

00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:57,279
change your life they will be amazing

00:40:53,169 --> 00:40:58,599
and no one will implement them I that's

00:40:57,279 --> 00:41:00,339
going to waste my time it's going to

00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:01,779
make me feel bad and it's going to raise

00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:04,989
expectations and people who don't know

00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:06,849
that that's not my job the roads that we

00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:10,029
get are the patches that people submit

00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:12,339
that's what the roads are right we are

00:41:10,029 --> 00:41:14,140
standing at the front here and people

00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:15,969
come to pro 5 port errs and say dude I

00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,669
just blazed the trail do you want to

00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:20,739
walk down it and we have to decide like

00:41:18,669 --> 00:41:22,029
yeah that's a good road or no man that

00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:23,380
one goes into the haunted forest and

00:41:22,029 --> 00:41:26,709
like I worked there for four years and

00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,880
I'm not going back so how do we decide

00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:29,079
which ones we want well they have to be

00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,660
backwards compatible right this is a

00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:32,640
huge virtue of pearl and some

00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,230
times we get hamstrung by it but more

00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,110
often than not this is this is one of

00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:39,420
the reasons pearl is so great it has to

00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:41,040
not be surprising has to be useful it

00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,320
has to have conceptual conception

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,960
simplicity this is teach ability it has

00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:48,030
to be readable on and someone out there

00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,230
is watching this video and laughing and

00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,540
saying pearl features have to be

00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:53,160
readable but this is this is really

00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,420
really important I think pearl is a very

00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,160
readable language if you write it the

00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,530
correct way and we need to keep it that

00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,750
way and not just these things but these

00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:03,450
things taken together right does going

00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:05,610
down this road change the language in

00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:07,350
such a way that we've changed the

00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:09,720
priorities of these in some places and

00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:11,280
started to make pearl not have the same

00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,990
balance that we're used to it's very

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,010
fuzzy I'm not sure how it works but I

00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:19,890
know it when I see it um so intelligent

00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:22,410
design right that's always the best way

00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:24,600
to build something i'm assuming

00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:27,810
sufficient intelligence and omnipotence

00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:29,760
so if you are God yeah that's how you do

00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:32,550
it right you boom you make everything

00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,470
I'm evolution on the other hand is work

00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,540
pretty well although it has required

00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:38,820
billions of deaths and millions of years

00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,950
and you know there have been some failed

00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,630
projects and I still have this thing in

00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,890
my cavity that like it's going to

00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,870
explode someday and I'll be in the

00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:48,000
hospital so it's it's got its own

00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:49,380
problem so what pearl really is going

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,230
through now is intelligent evolution

00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:54,780
where we get mutations people design our

00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:57,390
mutations and then the these mutations

00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,830
they mutate further and multiply in the

00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:01,740
captivity of the pro/5 porter's

00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:03,240
discussion lists and then we find the

00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,180
ones that we think are bad mutations and

00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,160
we brutally slaughter them and we hope

00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,500
that these mutations that we have

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,200
intelligently chosen the ones that are

00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,520
fit get us a better pearl this is why

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,560
it's a really great idea that we have

00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,000
the Velociraptor right he is the guy

00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,240
who's coming through a pro five porters

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,490
and finding the bad ideas and saying no

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,140
omnomnom and hopefully that means we end

00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:26,790
up with only these these good evolutions

00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,200
or the other way to look at it is this

00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:30,780
is why it's a great idea we have the

00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,300
onion right God gives us the onion right

00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,950
the onion gets to us through through i

00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,140
should say evolution or Darwin gives us

00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:39,360
the onion onion it gets to us in some

00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:41,250
state and what do we do we cultivate the

00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,190
onion we said ok the onions pretty cool

00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:45,440
but I'd like it better if it was yellow

00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,240
and I kind of want a sweeter onion so we

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,589
go plant it in Georgia and we start

00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,859
getting the onion that we won well same

00:43:48,589 --> 00:43:53,690
thing with pearl right darl re gives us

00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:55,609
pearl and we said okay pearls pretty

00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:56,780
cool but like let's cultivate it some

00:43:55,609 --> 00:43:58,579
more and figure out how we can make it

00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,530
even sweeter and yellower and delicious

00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:03,859
I don't know if pearls probably sposed

00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:05,300
to be orange but I'm not sure so so

00:44:03,859 --> 00:44:08,030
these both work out the camel the camel

00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,589
right I don't know if the camels camel

00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:12,650
evolutionarily is pretty weird but um

00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:14,329
but it is orange um so the problem is

00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,190
even we make these decisions man I'm

00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:17,150
running low on time even when we make

00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,530
these decisions we're going to make

00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:21,589
mistakes by which i mean i'm going to

00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:23,119
make mistakes how do we fix them because

00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:24,829
we have to recognize that we make

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,270
mistakes and i certainly recognize that

00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:30,500
we've made a lot of mistakes including

00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:31,609
me well i had to decide something and of

00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,310
course I make the wrong decision and

00:44:31,609 --> 00:44:35,599
everybody can tell and I want to fix

00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,400
that because like that smart assigned

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,859
operator that is not how I want to be

00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,420
remembered in Perl like I'm the guy who

00:44:39,859 --> 00:44:45,290
brought us that pound equal pound

00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:46,970
operator that know so if the feature was

00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:48,140
marked experimental right the Pearl

00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:51,650
Delta says we've introduced the

00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:52,940
experimental pearl sign operator yeah we

00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:55,760
can just remove it right okay it's

00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,349
experimental yank it out you kind of

00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,630
accept here are some things that are

00:44:57,349 --> 00:45:02,060
currently considered experimental for

00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:05,450
chem ulation on the windows lvalue

00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:07,460
subroutines weak references all right

00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:08,690
like how would you guys like it if I was

00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:11,780
like ad weak references are going out

00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:15,410
man 518 you're done strong references

00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:18,140
only so we need to fix this problem and

00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:19,670
the problem is not that we need to not

00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,740
remove experimental things it's that we

00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:24,200
need to go through the document brian

00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:26,690
foy made called prolix pearl experiment

00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,010
I think maybe pro experimental that

00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,780
contains a list of all the stuff that

00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:31,640
appears to still be marked experimental

00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:34,130
and we need to say hey guys seriously

00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,390
weak references are not experimental and

00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:37,040
really keep it down to these are the

00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:40,130
experimental things and yeah but we

00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,630
might throw those away sorry and start

00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:44,000
hiding the behind stuff so that we can

00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:46,760
rip out mistakes as soon as possible if

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,069
it's not that we need deprecated it so

00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,050
our deprecation cycle works like this we

00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:52,970
say maybe we say we're probably gonna

00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:55,040
deprecated that and then we say it's

00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:56,580
deprecated please stop using it and then

00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,800
a year later we're still saying

00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:01,260
and then finally it's gone so we give

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:05,160
you two years to notice these warnings

00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:06,600
pull out the stuff and fix your code it

00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,150
means that if you're running 58 and

00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,680
you're going to upgrade to 5 18 or 516

00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:12,150
you're going to miss some stuff that

00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,460
went through its whole deprecation cycle

00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:17,070
so upgrading at least every two years is

00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:18,690
a really good idea I I submit that if

00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:20,730
you get off 58 and on to something

00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:23,040
modern it becomes much easier to upgrade

00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:26,010
because they happen more regularly but

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,320
but then there's a class of bugs that we

00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:30,450
can't just detect and make fatal

00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:33,330
practically like re base right this is

00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:34,950
the the dollar left bracket which lets

00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:36,360
you change the starting index of an

00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:37,620
array if you don't know what it is

00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,020
suffice it to say that there was a dumb

00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:43,050
feature in Perl and we wanted to get rid

00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,970
of it and now we can write we bowlin we

00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,380
stole it from awk right i think my

00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:48,960
understanding is that it's only it was

00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:51,690
really only there to allow octa pearl

00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,160
translation and some people kind of were

00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:58,220
like I'm just going to use that that's

00:46:53,160 --> 00:47:00,150
great because I like tickle um and um

00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,530
and we can remove it because we can

00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,210
detect it how do you know if someone is

00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:04,950
using dollar left bracket well because

00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:07,260
there's a dollar and a left bracket and

00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,610
they're in their code right i mean you

00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,660
could detect that and you can detect it

00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:12,810
correctly but there are other bugs you

00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:14,310
can't detect like the unicode bug so you

00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:17,370
get a string you pull some strings out

00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:20,130
of the ether and then you tack on an a

00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:21,540
acute so i don't know what's in dollar X

00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:24,060
but then I do know that it ends in an a

00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:26,850
acute and I say hey does this string

00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:28,830
contain any a acute and I don't care if

00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:33,000
they're uppercase or lowercase what's

00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:34,470
the answer it depends we don't know like

00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,100
it's going to depend on what was in a

00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:40,110
choir input and maybe some other stuff

00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:42,360
this is nuts this is the unicode bug and

00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:45,960
this is fixed in modern pearl so how do

00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:48,600
you deprecated the old behavior you

00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,310
sorry you get you'd love to it do we

00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,230
gates get rid if you can't detect that

00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:53,820
someone is using it how do you detect

00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:57,320
someone is using this old behavior well

00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,320
they've got strings in their program

00:47:57,569 --> 00:48:04,019
whoops so we have to be really really

00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:07,960
careful about putting stuff into pearl

00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:09,339
that we can't find and kill later right

00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,069
every feature that goes into Pearl has

00:48:09,339 --> 00:48:13,869
to get a little tracking tag in his ear

00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:16,630
so that we can fix mistakes because we

00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:17,710
make them I'm getting really close to

00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,730
the end so I'm going to fly through

00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:20,109
these are features that people are

00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,700
really working on so this is the real

00:48:20,109 --> 00:48:23,920
future of pearl get and written by real

00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,980
programmers so this is this is some

00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,049
exciting stuff pluggable syntax

00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:31,329
especially Zefram and sprout are working

00:48:29,049 --> 00:48:34,210
on the ability to write new kinds of

00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:36,069
syntax for pearl on Sipan so you can say

00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:37,960
I've got an experimental construct don't

00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:41,589
add a new kind of loop a new kind of

00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:43,450
scope a new kind of control flow you can

00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:45,299
write that and it looks like its own

00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:48,160
syntax not like a bunch of method calls

00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:52,390
the mob this is not going on in the core

00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:55,930
but this struggle now going on to build

00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:58,240
a light fast awesome meta object

00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:00,220
protocol system for the pro/5 core I'm

00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,440
really supportive of this I don't think

00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,490
it's going to happen this year I don't

00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,869
think getting into the pearl core this

00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:05,980
year but it's happening this year it's

00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:07,059
happening right now a lot of it is

00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,609
written and it's really really exciting

00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:11,890
stuff this is a simple issue one that I

00:49:09,609 --> 00:49:14,380
think is awesome class sets and regex

00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:16,509
what if you could say this I want a

00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:18,539
string that's made up of characters that

00:49:16,509 --> 00:49:21,069
are all a through z except for vowels

00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:22,630
now this is this is a simplistic example

00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:24,880
right you could just write this but

00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:27,519
imagine all the other stuff you can say

00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,519
I want this class minus this class or

00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:33,940
this other one I'm awesome I want this

00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:35,680
feature once or twice a week um casemod

00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,940
escapes this needs to get fixed this is

00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:41,950
an awesome bug which I will only

00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:43,150
described by saying you've got you know

00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,230
I'm going to skip this one but yeah ask

00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,609
me for this slide later cuz it's an

00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:48,819
awesome awesome bug that I'm just very

00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:53,440
short on time M siddik or as it's known

00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:55,329
to me absa dick pearl supports episodic

00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,640
in theory but pearl had is not compile

00:49:55,329 --> 00:50:02,619
any epic platform it hasn't in several

00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:04,420
years and IBM has it's been difficult to

00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:07,029
come to terms of the IBM on getting

00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:08,500
access to a z/os machine and we'd like

00:50:07,029 --> 00:50:09,800
to keep it working on episodic for a

00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,260
number of reasons

00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:15,140
so if anybody here has a z/os machine

00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:17,600
and wants to smoke pearl you will get a

00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:20,360
lot of hugs and beer or I mean other

00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:22,880
things that you want um if you can help

00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:24,950
us I'm talk to me smart match the future

00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,290
of smart match is I think not pulling it

00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:30,890
out into the woodshed and shooting it I

00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:32,630
I think the future is to to make it

00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:35,330
better but it has to be worked out and

00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:36,530
it's a difficult problem to fix it

00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:39,830
depends on the type system which is

00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:41,090
which is also in flight on the we need

00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:42,530
to fix that but the simpler thing here's

00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,120
what I real advice to you this is not

00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:45,710
the future of pearl except for in your

00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,420
pool code when you're thinking about

00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:49,400
using the smart match operator use perl

00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:51,170
6 junction instead which lets you say

00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,360
all this stuff if x is greater than all

00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:55,670
these numbers numerically if this is

00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,110
equal to any of the keys in there I you

00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:59,570
could write exists there but lets you

00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:01,130
know move on if Z is numerically equal

00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:02,840
to any one of these elements you can do

00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:04,220
most of the stuff people really want out

00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,860
of smart match with this I use it all

00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:08,330
the time and it's great magic flies ok

00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,730
what if you had a number in a variable

00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:12,590
and pearl and then you like printf tit

00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:16,070
and you could still tell that it was a

00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:18,500
number ok maybe I'm the only one really

00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:20,450
excited by that but the ability to know

00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,500
like to I don't say to fix the pearl

00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:23,030
type system because the type system

00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,890
isn't isn't this isn't something that's

00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:27,320
broken in it the broken thing is like

00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:29,510
the way that we cache stringy values of

00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,490
numbers and numbers of strings if we

00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:33,530
could fix that we'd have way way more

00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,970
information about what kind of value you

00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:36,740
have in your variables and you can do

00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:39,740
all kinds of great stuff like pick smart

00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:42,080
match utf-8 what if when you open a file

00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,700
utf-8 it was strict and wouldn't let you

00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,410
load garbage whites into your memory and

00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,150
then like explode and destroy your

00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:49,130
program would that be great someone's

00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:52,040
written that and hopefully we'll get

00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:53,870
into the Pearl core very soon this guy

00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,480
if you have seen this guy for sticking

00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:59,120
arbitrary code if anybody here was at

00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,620
Karen Polly's talk about how profound

00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:03,230
ation has been spending money Dave

00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:06,050
Mitchell has spent she said 422 hours i

00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:08,810
think on one bug that's this bug but the

00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:10,700
bug is let you put arbitrary code inside

00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:12,800
of a regular expression which is like

00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:14,300
Perl code like this it's crazy and it's

00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,520
actually going to it's done this

00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:18,020
basically works now for a long time it

00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:20,900
was totally experimental and totally

00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:21,640
insane now it works and okay I'm over

00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,170
time I'm going to

00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,430
really really quick for the stuff I want

00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:27,069
to see happen so this is my secret

00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:29,230
roadmap that i promised i didn't have

00:52:27,069 --> 00:52:30,730
don't but put a hand in front of the

00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:32,619
camera don't let the world know this is

00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:34,900
just for us i really want to see the

00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:39,099
courgette slimmed down kick-out lots of

00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:40,960
modules that oblong in there but i want

00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:43,210
to do that in a context where you can

00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,130
take the pearl source code and drop in

00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:46,750
stuff you want in it and produce your

00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:49,210
own distribution of pearl and say this

00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:50,319
is battery pearl you know not only with

00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:53,200
all the stuff that got kicked out but

00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:54,700
also with mousse and with you know games

00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:59,049
nintendo mario and whatever vital stuff

00:52:54,700 --> 00:53:01,000
you need a fatal implicit clothes this

00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:02,500
is like a little change but oh my gosh

00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,240
the value of this in catching bugs

00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:08,500
especially in one-liners like if you use

00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:12,039
an implicit clothes on on like a dash I

00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:13,720
if you run a program with dash I and do

00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:15,279
stuff and it fails to write the thing

00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,809
out it thinks that it succeeds which is

00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:19,839
really really really bad because there's

00:53:16,809 --> 00:53:22,000
no implicit fatality on closing I would

00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:24,880
love for us to have exceptions that were

00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,680
not strings we've kind of had failed

00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,650
we've started and failed this product a

00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:31,420
few times but man would it be nice the

00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:35,230
mop I'd love getting the mop in I'd love

00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:37,150
to have pluggable method mro beyond the

00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:39,480
order of packages like get get rid of

00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:41,440
the idea that classes are packages

00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,819
wouldn't it be great if you could look

00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:46,059
at a string and pearl and know whether

00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:48,640
it was characters or bytes um now I want

00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:50,589
to say it is quite likely that we

00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,869
technically cannot achieve this there

00:53:50,589 --> 00:53:54,400
are a few avenues we think we might be

00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:56,650
able to go down that good that involve

00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,809
having like a try nary value you know

00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:01,480
it's a string it's the but it's text

00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:02,589
it's a byte string it's something and

00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,549
right now all your programs would be

00:54:02,589 --> 00:54:05,950
something you'd have to start decorating

00:54:03,549 --> 00:54:08,259
auto boxing and poor so this would solve

00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:09,519
huge numbers of syntax arguments so

00:54:08,259 --> 00:54:13,299
what's what's the syntax here you use a

00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:14,859
method this method like we'd get rid of

00:54:13,299 --> 00:54:17,019
the auto d rough stuff that I talked

00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:18,039
about yesterday okay um I'm sorry that I

00:54:17,019 --> 00:54:19,000
had to run through some of the stuff at

00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:21,759
the end because I would have loved you

00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,170
go into more detail I'm gonna have to

00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:26,470
tighten this up for my 10 minute smaller

00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:28,240
slaughterhouse calm but are there any

00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:30,359
questions while we were here and over

00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,359
