- used for a bunch of official projects

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,470
it's an onion on Dan's shirt there with

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:13,230
staff cPanel for those amazing flashing

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:15,269
onion shirts so this is our logo we have

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,920
been registering trademarks in the USA

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,560
counter to the European Union and Japan

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,230
and since I spoke to you last year we

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,289
have got our registry of marking cap so

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,939
that was successful we are rear edge'

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,590
stirring our trademark in the United

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:37,800
States I have not heard from a lawyer so

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:41,879
I assume there's no problems not yet

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,500
so there's no okay I'm one of the things

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,020
- what a registered trademark is it has

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,180
to be seen to be used so the parole

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,700
community has more than one mark and

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,860
thankfully I was able I requested from

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,170
the people who are older that we have an

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,350
onion on the download screen because

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,770
that is good evidence for us to use this

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:07,080
in America we have two cases in Japan I

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,700
don't know yes we did one of them in

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,439
conjunction with the Japanese parole

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,240
Association and throw some new runs the

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,150
Japanese provocations in the audience I

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,680
will say nice things like the JPA okay

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,030
so we wanted to register the onion

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,830
device and Pearl

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,450
some people think we've registered the

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,040
Burwood pearl we have never tried to do

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,150
that this is all about the onion in

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,009
association with Pearl we wanted to do

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,509
that in Japan and we didn't want any

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,939
problems really in the European Union

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,610
calendar America but the word Pearl was

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,750
already owned for two Japanese companies

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:40,680
it's spelt it friendly but that's the

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,659
word pearl pearl versus Pearl father e

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,470
versus father it's exactly the same word

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:49,799
in Japanese right so we feel we did not

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,420
win our Korkis um this so is the

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,100
certificate showing that we have managed

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,869
to register and we were only able to do

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,700
that because our lawyers in Japan

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,960
thought that they could negotiate with

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,040
the two companies who owned the

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:04,740
trademark in Japan so there are two

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,360
Japanese companies who agreed to assign

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,039
this to us they did not have to do that

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,140
the only thing they asked for was for

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,090
their legal fees to be pet so we're

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,709
incredibly grateful for that so we have

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,540
managed to register

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,590
and the onion device in Japan and the

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,000
reason it was so important because

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,709
honestly when we lost the court case

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,680
it's a lot of money to continue court

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:24,930
cases and we did consider not

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,640
registering it because well I don't know

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,019
how much we needed to have it in Japan

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,400
but there were two court cases in Japan

00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:35,340
the other one was to overturn the

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,469
trademark on the bare word pearl because

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,090
you see someone else managed to register

00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,329
the word pearl in Japan in the

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,010
difference between mark class so I know

00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,959
it's hard to get people to realize that

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,519
trademarks can be an important thing but

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,859
when someone else who's not involved

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,419
with Pearl Manley's used to register a

00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:53,430
trademark things can get difficult for

00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,840
the community and the Japan pearl

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,250
Association got in touch with the Pro

00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,689
Foundation and asked if we would help

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:04,290
support this particular case so in

00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:06,359
October that case was overturned

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,060
there is no no registration of the bird

00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:11,150
word pearl in Japan anymore but we do

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,099
have a registration of problem on our -

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,260
so the legal things were incredibly

00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,790
successful this year I got a lot of work

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,930
done for a while people thought I was

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,430
being very quiet about what was

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,989
happening in the prolongation but a lot

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,359
of my time has been taken up talking to

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,340
lawyers and I'm sure you all understand

00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:27,239
that I kind of blog about all those

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,489
things to do lawyers

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,810
I just can't and I've even been careful

00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,090
not to mention too many names here this

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,919
morning but really I'm very grateful

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,449
many many people in the parallel

00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,579
foundation send us evidence for that

00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,560
case in Japan there was months of work

00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:42,150
put into it I had people from Europe

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,129
sending me magazines to prove that the

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,870
word pearl was in common usage I had

00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:47,519
people from America I mean the community

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,689
really got behind it even though we have

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,799
to do it very quietly very quickly few

00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,199
other things that we're doing we not

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,689
have a marketing committee that deals

00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,310
with marketing those useful slides but I

00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:01,139
think I I think they did that slide

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,970
because you know marketing and marketing

00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,489
just amuses me so much every time I see

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:11,699
it I'm sorry mark I can't help but I

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:13,470
just get them used easily amused yes see

00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:17,609
it's marketing runs our Marketing

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:19,380
Committee is responsible for social

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:20,970
networking I'm sure you probably notice

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,469
that we've started to do things like

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,539
Twitter and Facebook and Google+ and

00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:26,370
then many many social network things

00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:27,750
that exists like that we never did this

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,490
before we're getting better

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,830
JT's done a great job with this

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,270
conference and sending information like

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,820
to people we really need to be better at

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,760
that and Mark is working to help us

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,130
improve our communication peril calm we

00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:45,120
fund the articles that are written from

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:47,250
home for the domain is we're allowed to

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,530
use it generously by the person who owns

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:52,140
it and we have been trying to get

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,490
up-to-date content on it the other thing

00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,490
that marketing has been doing is trying

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,320
to improve our websites so Yap seeded

00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,910
org was changed this year very

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,200
embarrassingly at one point it didn't

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,110
actually have the decrease of this

00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,050
conference that was a wee bit out of yet

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,180
but mark was working on that and will

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,590
continue to do so

00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,700
gonna end on a bit of a sad note I I

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,840
hear that they could be streaming and I

00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,730
really wanted to be upbeat about

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,730
everything but we didn't get into the

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,620
google Summer of Code this year we did a

00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,330
lot of promotion for it and we did a lot

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,940
of work and I know some people were very

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,710
disappointed I also know that it was not

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,120
because of the : in the application

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,740
whose simply because there's so many

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,530
organizations who won't take part in a

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,630
google Summer of Code so I'm hoping that

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,460
Florian and his team will have the

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,290
energy it's very hard to have the energy

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,930
to do all this voluntary work especially

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,370
that you know isn't successful so I'm

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,830
really hoping that they have the energy

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,210
and motivation to try again next year to

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,030
continue to take part in the Google

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,260
Hogan and I think it it will go well

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,650
because the sustain was very successful

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,390
for us last year and given the time

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,770
that's all I'm going to say so thank you

00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,770
very much for coming in listening

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,939
[Applause]

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,810
