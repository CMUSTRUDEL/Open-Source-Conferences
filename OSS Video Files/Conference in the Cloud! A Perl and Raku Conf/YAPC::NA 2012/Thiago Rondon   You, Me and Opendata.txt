okay hello my name is char gone and i'm

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,440
here today to talk about you me and open

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,449
data and maybe something about pro two

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:23,340
in the last year i'm studying about this

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:27,150
this stuff and it's why i try to answer

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:31,619
today why's bro can be the super glue or

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:34,800
the open data open data is a big

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:38,190
movement today that you saw in business

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,070
in government so what I try to figure

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:46,230
out here is about ideas motivations

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:50,969
cases future business and the link is

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:54,570
data so i have to answer yes to answer

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:57,570
why is so hard to create applications

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,420
based on government data and the second

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,650
is which knowledge our society needs to

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,830
be able to use open data and maybe which

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:13,049
knowledge we as developers programming

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:16,110
needed to know okay that's okay so to

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:21,020
make applications but so let's go first

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:25,290
here is a picture from apke graphic that

00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:30,720
we can understand more what is data the

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:33,229
first box we saw ingredients this is the

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,420
data in the second is the information

00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:41,549
it's a cake with that data the 30 it's a

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:45,060
presentation that we have some feeling

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:51,329
at the cake and the knowledge what we

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:55,259
consume in so this is the data so just

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:59,100
to to show a tag cloud to understand

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:07,979
more what's open jadam open data needs

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:11,760
to be completed primary is is the people

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,000
that puts the data don't change modify

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,760
the file or

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,450
anything to do this file another thing

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:23,520
is that the data can be readable by some

00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:27,010
machine for example just not for human

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:31,959
another thing about the open data it's

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:38,340
the open data sorry I'm little nervous

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:38,340
anyway English is not very good so

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:50,470
another think that is the data needs to

00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:55,120
be free as lysis sorry this is too

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:57,730
difficult you know okay so let's go to

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,840
some examples that we have in their real

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:06,010
words about open data this is a that the

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:11,830
Japanese cities make to show in the real

00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:13,239
time what is the reduction in Japan this

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,120
is just possible because the

00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:25,090
government's make out this research in

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:29,230
Japan and in and out sorry and push your

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:32,440
open data so the people use this this

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:36,280
application so anyone can do something

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:39,790
with that another think it's the live

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,959
train map on the London under the gun so

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,329
anyone can make sense some app to to

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:50,709
falling where is the train is going in

00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:52,840
the rock in real time to this is we can

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:56,829
just do that because the open data to

00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:01,989
the 30 it's the people that share bikes

00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:05,440
in big cities have some specs that puts

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:08,530
the data and puts the information about

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,890
the bikes so the people can make a lot

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:14,709
of apps with that for example nobody is

00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:18,729
the owner of information so I'm the

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:22,030
London I can share something about the

00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:23,560
bikes in a park for example in Brazil

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,760
for example huge and they're the people

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,090
use these two to share

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:33,530
the bikes that we can share it we can

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:36,830
range this bike so this this kind of

00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:39,710
thing is just about people that make

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:42,140
data in different countries with

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:46,430
different languages and can make this

00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:51,860
kind of app another thing we have that

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:55,640
the group the evolution of a ripple

00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,800
yuning you can saw what kind of things

00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,280
that the government's in the country's

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,700
make more so this is a graph that tried

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,680
to explain that another thing it's this

00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,920
website that is called where does my

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,490
money go there we get some data from the

00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:16,460
government to make a new experience to

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:20,390
the user because today is too difficult

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:23,090
to go to the government web web site try

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:27,140
to see the money that government spent

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:32,180
it's too difficult to that we speak more

00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:35,240
some deciding this all this is a project

00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:39,110
that i love because i have a lot of

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:42,920
ideas to do it's called a artopia this

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:45,530
website you answer some questions too

00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:49,460
like for example do you like to spend

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:53,390
more money in education or in health and

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:55,640
with your choice this website show what

00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,490
is the best counter for you that a

00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,590
government think like you and this is

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:04,130
just possible because these governments

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:08,390
have some information in open data so

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:11,690
it's it's very fun and it's and I think

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:13,910
it's and it's very interesting to the

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:17,510
people understand the country's the

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:20,390
difference another one it's that which

00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:23,210
is the crime rate with my seed in my

00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:27,020
States so I have a lot of types of cream

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:29,090
for example in one state of brazil that

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,760
we make this website to show the

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:37,550
information in this map we'll talk more

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:40,610
about this website too so we have some

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,640
some motivations about open Jaden we

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:46,670
have four main blocks the government the

00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,790
people that try to make mark transparent

00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:53,390
we hope that the government tried to do

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:55,310
that participation collaboration another

00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:58,580
think it's a society that the people

00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:01,430
needs to participate more with open

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,880
nests philosoph another think it's about

00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:08,350
concepts I think the people on universe

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,450
the academic people try to do that and

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:15,430
business try to make some thinking you

00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:20,840
to win my money and to do more things

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:23,900
whatever so this graph key is is is how

00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,960
opened it is now we have some kind of

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:30,040
people that is on safety hackers and see

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,290
civic activists that is non-commercial

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,630
stuff and you have the people that make

00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:38,870
something now with data journalism for

00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:41,510
example deguire the Guardian has all the

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:45,200
newspapers in open data formats today so

00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:49,850
I can make a website that I can read

00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:53,390
online and I can I don't care about to

00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:57,920
sink the data every time because for

00:07:53,390 --> 00:08:01,700
example if somebody wrote a news on the

00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:04,970
Guardian and in my blog I put a link it

00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:08,060
to the Guardian to comment something so

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:13,340
if the Guardian updates this this stuff

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:19,580
I can get in my blog too so in the in

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:22,580
the business ah this is a boot that the

00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,860
people every time said when you don't

00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:29,300
know how to win money for example with

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:31,430
some think read this book because today

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:35,270
is very difficult to understand how to

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:37,820
win money for that and now we have a bus

00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:40,640
just in the government stuff we have a

00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,820
little companies that use this now for

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,360
do something but for us to get our

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:50,510
ecosystem a nice i consisting that the

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,200
to work we we need business we we need

00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:56,360
companies

00:08:51,200 --> 00:09:00,410
doing something so what why do you try

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:03,740
to say here you will have diamond the

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:06,290
people need to do new things with data

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:10,640
but the company's doesn't know how to do

00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:12,710
that in my view in the future we have

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,610
some companies that work with urban

00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:19,640
systems to deliver more service to the

00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:22,760
people we have a lot of things about

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,040
economics stuff for example the people

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,960
to study the economic in one state one

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:32,570
country another thing that I think it's

00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,510
growing up fast now in open data it's

00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:38,570
machine-to-machine because it's a way to

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,760
connect apps and device and now we have

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,730
just simple protocol to that like

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,790
messages test to communicate to apps or

00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:49,900
to device with open data I think we have

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:54,340
devices with cement ski that can talk

00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:56,870
alone without us I think it's it's nice

00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,510
another thing is that a journalism that

00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:04,640
I think a lot of newspapers do that now

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:08,240
in Europe and main steps with Joe

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,210
location but to have a problem today

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,080
their real word is not open that data

00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:19,280
yet so why saponin pro can make our

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:23,240
lives easy the big problem when you

00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:26,710
don't have open data stuff or data we

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:31,790
need to process data the web square

00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:37,670
rabbit growling and this is what the pro

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:39,950
can do very good so let's show some

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,460
example how government spend money with

00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:45,830
health today in Brazil to you understand

00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,360
this kind of information you need to go

00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:51,230
to the official website of the

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:54,110
government and just click and click and

00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:58,580
click and click and it's very difficult

00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:01,700
to understand this dismount of of data

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,100
so we can see a graphic in the website

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:08,329
like that but it's not

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:12,819
very nice for me so what we try to do

00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:17,209
it's a new experience to the user so

00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:20,569
here I can have this the Box in NASA

00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:24,079
three that we can click in the box and

00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:27,350
can go on for example if you click in

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,300
the first box you can see what the

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:32,660
people what the government spent with

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:35,300
how for example hospitals with some

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:38,810
action that governments do and and you

00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:43,430
can go click and click and see in the in

00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:48,829
this graph G how how much the government

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:51,500
spent by state another example which is

00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:53,870
the crime you hate in my city we can do

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:57,560
for example today entering the website

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,360
of the government and get XO files but

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,630
you have a lot of problem XO files

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:07,910
doesn't excel file doesn't open data and

00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:11,089
we have 15 per year and the name of the

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:13,160
crimes change between years so it's very

00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:16,699
difficult to understand this kind of

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:22,189
information another thing to do the

00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:25,880
things and to understand more this

00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:29,089
information i need the crime numbers but

00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:32,269
i want the location the number of

00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:34,430
population in the city so i need to get

00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:37,220
in this another website that is from

00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:40,370
government soon so what do you do here

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:44,290
in this website we can enter and fill it

00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:48,050
up the ear the type of crime in the city

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:51,769
when you choose these three things I I

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:57,019
make a map that's in the place that is

00:12:51,769 --> 00:13:02,959
big red you you see where's the crime is

00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:06,439
more okay so let's go today what you

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:10,120
want in the future link its data so link

00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:13,309
its data is is this network this is a

00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:16,160
cloud from the linkage of open data

00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:17,570
project that you have a lot of things

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,160
today

00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:27,890
we haven't szymanski way so Tim

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:30,110
berners-lee wrote a text just just

00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:33,380
attacks about design issues about

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:37,270
linkage data that makes some give some

00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:41,540
stars to website about the content so

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:43,790
when you have one star this data is just

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:47,810
available on the web when you have five

00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:52,540
stars you have the contains the data the

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:57,890
semantic it's free to use in he use so

00:13:52,540 --> 00:14:01,430
what I think the main suggested a to to

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:03,860
show the data is the research

00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:07,520
description framework it's a meta data

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:10,370
model it's just a way to help resent the

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,460
things because today we have contents in

00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:18,920
the files but you have another files

00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:21,890
that say what is this content so for

00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:25,510
example if if you have if you're having

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:30,230
Wikipedia today we can see for example

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:32,420
the view of level and in the view of

00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:36,080
their wall you have a lot of things

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:38,930
about him we can read but the computers

00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,240
doesn't understand what is this data you

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:44,450
need to make some scrapper some scripts

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:48,380
to understand where where the level born

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:51,010
what if you do with DPP do project that

00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:54,650
get this stuff and contains from them

00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:59,780
the Wikipedia and make this in the

00:14:54,650 --> 00:15:03,380
semantic way we can have for example we

00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:07,580
can get just we can just ask for example

00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:10,640
where level barn what is the city the

00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:14,660
level today you can have this answer

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:17,690
because it's all semantics so this is a

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:21,290
little example and that the people

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:24,560
showing the docs about our GF that

00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:29,060
represent what is Lincoln's data so we

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,670
have some place in the web that contain

00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,610
our name and you

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:40,300
have a lot of resources that you can

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:45,120
explain who is this this place so we

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:47,860
have a big project on unpro about our GF

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:52,780
we have a lot of stuff to do with

00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:56,500
szymanski things and I think now in pro

00:15:52,780 --> 00:16:00,340
we have tools to do when we don't have

00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:03,430
too much open data and we have a lot of

00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:09,300
tools to do when we have open dairy

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:09,300
