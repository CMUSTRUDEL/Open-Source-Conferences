skip the music a little bit so we had a

00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:52,570
lot of amazing sponsors this year that

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,509
really pulled through for us to be able

00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,280
to pull off a conference of this size it

00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:59,470
takes a hell of a lot of money you may

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,670
not realize how much actually but it

00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,920
takes a hell of a lot of money to be

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,720
able to do all of the things that we

00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,840
have done this year and we couldn't have

00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,280
done it without these guys so I'd like

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,640
to hear a round of applause for all of

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,640
our sponsors

00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:24,469
okay so I want to start a little bit

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,090
this morning with some statistics we've

00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:28,299
done a lot of really cool things this

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,739
year at least I think they're cool and I

00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:32,930
wanted to share some of that with you so

00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:36,620
the first thing is I know I've annoyed a

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:44,450
few people but 422 blog posts since last

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:46,670
Yap see and because of that we sold out

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,889
and that's huge that means that what

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,139
we're doing is important every year

00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:53,180
pretty much Asia sells out yap see Asia

00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:55,099
and they proclaim it on the blog they're

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,419
really happy about it and we should be

00:02:55,099 --> 00:03:00,049
happy about that too because we've

00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:02,030
achieved that and again this sends out a

00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:04,609
message far beyond the Pearl community

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,829
that what we're doing is important and

00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:08,870
that people really want to be here so

00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:10,939
that will help attendance next year

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,680
it'll help people plan ahead next year

00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:14,239
which will make it easier for the people

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,859
that are planning next year if they know

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:21,379
who's coming earlier that's better we

00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:23,569
had 32 people in the 02 pearl workshop

00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:25,310
before the conference this year that's

00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:27,229
32 people that didn't really know

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:31,639
anything about pearl coming into this

00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:33,680
that's a huge number of new new growth

00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:35,870
for the pearl community which is a good

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,359
thing and they're here today many of

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,989
them continuing on with the beginners

00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:45,079
track that's nearly eight percent of the

00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:50,870
attendees are here brand new to pearl

00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:54,620
today that's cool 446 of you are here

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,090
today not quite all here yet but 146 of

00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,579
you are going to be here today to

00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,959
participate in the conference and to my

00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:01,939
knowledge according to the Perl

00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,189
foundation that's the largest number of

00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:07,180
attendees at a North Sea north america

00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:07,180
ever so

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:18,410
in addition there's hundreds I I don't

00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:22,400
think thousands but maybe thousands more

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:25,370
watching live streams at their homes and

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,840
offices now all over the world we know

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,030
that a number of the sponsors have

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,310
actually even set this up to stream and

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,380
conference rooms in their offices so

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,000
that there are other employees that

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,070
couldn't make it here are able to

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
participate in the conference as well so

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:45,580
that's huge raise your hand if this is

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,580
your first yapchi look at that

00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:58,650
that's growth okay so that's that's

00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,360
about it but I want to talk about for

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,770
the stats but there's a lot more that I

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,590
could share with you individually if

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:07,280
you're interested i do want to point out

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:10,530
there are these shirts if you liked it

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,540
that logo is you'll see a lot of those

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,100
shirts walking around is that somebody's

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,930
wearing that shirt that means they can

00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,300
help you if you have a question so that

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,280
is that is the FG staff shirt for this

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,870
year so if you do have a question seek

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,940
out one of those people they will either

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,990
be able to help you or point you to

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:29,940
someone that can help you we're going to

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,190
have a very fun conference we don't want

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,650
a lot of drama at the conference we just

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,200
want everybody to be good nice to each

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,900

be fun it's not that hard be fun let's

00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,380
have a round profile

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,080
if there's any questions about what is

00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,850
or is not appropriate check out the code

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,960
of conduct you can snap a photo of a QR

00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:14,400
code right there or go to the URL below

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,590
okay this year we're also introducing

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,160
something really cool call the gap seed

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:22,050
bingo in your in your bag in your

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,820
conference bag you will have gotten by

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,860
absolute bingo card there are 25

00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,960
activities on here that you should try

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,820
to complete if you can complete even a

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,770
row of them you will have a really great

00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,050
conference if you can create complete

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,000
all 25 of them you'll have a mega bingo

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,060
and therefore you'll have a great

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,130
conference so you should really try and

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,300
do as many of these as possible that'll

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,970
help you get the most out of the

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,590
conference and on the back of that card

00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,000
there's a lot of really good tips if

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,770
this is your first conference or your

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,210
first yap see there's a lot of good tips

00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,580
for getting the most out of the

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:58,370
conference so I encourage you to read

00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:00,930
the back of that card we have a lot of

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,700
raffles this year we replace the auction

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,560
with raffles and we're going to spread

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,530
those rifles out over the course of the

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,270
conference that allows a lot of a lot

00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,400
more people to participate than can in

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,820
the car in the auction because some of

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,950
you are quite frankly insane so you'll

00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,539
go and spend five hundred dollars and

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,430
that kind of puts a lot of people out of

00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,750
the running I like that you'll spend

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,729
five hundred dollars to help the pro

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,380
foundation and the pro community but I'd

00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:27,120
like a lot more people to be able to

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,010
participate that's why we went with five

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,139
dollar raffles it's something that

00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:33,270
everybody can get involved in and this

00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,030
all of the proceeds of this benefit

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,130
pearl Lowe basically doing this to build

00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,660
a better pearl so all the money that

00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:42,330
comes in for this is going to basically

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,669
help sponsor people to fix bugs and add

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:48,139
improvements to pearl so that's a pretty

00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:50,760
cool thing oh one quick announcement

00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:53,669
last night at the dinner somebody left a

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,000
black windbreaker that will be up here

00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:59,520

raffle for lunch with Larry and

00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:11,940

different facility than normal I wanted

00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:10,100
to give you some maps to move around

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,480
with a group this large we couldn't fit

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,269
everybody in one building so we actually

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,939
had to lease out two buildings so we

00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:18,470
have today we're in lowell in or this

00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:22,759
morning we're in low we're in the red

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:24,649
room right here you have probably

00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:26,899
already been up to the registration area

00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,459
but if you haven't that is where the

00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:30,889
registration area is and that's also

00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:33,170
where you'll buy your raffle tickets so

00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:35,990
that's just up up the stairs and around

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,519
the corner then as you go outside to the

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,970
street out front here that's Langdon

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,009
Street and this is the Lowell center you

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,209
need to go down the hill if you go up

00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:47,149
the hill you're going the wrong way you

00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:49,430
want to go down the hill toward the pile

00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:50,629
center that is where all the other talks

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,970
will be held today so there will be

00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:55,100
talks in this room and then there will

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:58,430
also be four other tracks in the pile

00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,870
center this is what the pile center

00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,300
looks like on the inside there are three

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,519
floors so there are sessions on the

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,829
first floor second and third you'll have

00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:10,100
to look at the maps to see which one is

00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:13,129
for your track there is only 10 minutes

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,600
between each session so you're going to

00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:16,579
have to hustle if you're going to move

00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,629
from this roof of that building to this

00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:24,559
building I will point out that there are

00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:26,600
there is food in room 112 and 111 all

00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:30,740
day today and for the rest of the week

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,540
as well and and there there's also there

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,160
are also drinks right outside this door

00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,959
every morning actually

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,470
all day long there will be coffee tea

00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:41,149
juice water and soda there but if you're

00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,850
looking for some snacks you'll need to

00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:47,329
do that over there now when I say food I

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:49,639
do mean snacks lunch is on your own so a

00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:50,839
block that way is a street called state

00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,759
street that has a hundred different

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,829
restaurants on it of every variety from

00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,300
Afghani cuisine all the way to I don't

00:12:54,829 --> 00:13:01,189
know what would be with a Z but

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:03,230
everything is there so what's it Sulu

00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:04,850
okay I don't think there is any zoo

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:11,029
though unfortunately so I guess I just

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:13,370
lied to you so so I also just to plan

00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:15,079

00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:18,379

00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:22,189
a linode beer garden on the roof of the

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,339
pile center overlooking the lake so

00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:27,379
that'll be a beautiful view linode has

00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:30,379

00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:44,269

00:17:52,250 --> 00:18:06,250

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,840
website is updated yes sorry I should

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,160
have mentioned that as well so the

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:22,150
website is up to date but you're

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:27,200
obviously your paper is not okay good

00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:28,700
yes there are some changes for tomorrow

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,800
and Friday as well we'll cover those

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,179
tomorrow morning and friday morning

00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:37,820
because there will probably be more

00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:40,100
changes so all right on the back of your

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,530
badge you probably have already noted

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,910
this but there is a Wi-Fi username and

00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,740
password on the back of your badge that

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:48,950
will get you access to the Wi-Fi network

00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,690
on the campus here and that's it's the

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,340
same username and password for both

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,750
buildings so if you log in once you'll

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,880
be automatically logged in to the other

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,560
building so that's on the back of your

00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,640
badge right at the bottom of the batch

00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,640
very tiny print

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,640
