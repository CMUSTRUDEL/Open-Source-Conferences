so that you'll be able to give it and we

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,060
will get started now

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:28,090
afternoon everybody talks about the

00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,189
design implementation of a did you mean

00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,900
spellcheck server so it's not like

00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:33,790
general spell check in the terms of like

00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,460
you have a document and it's checking

00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,690
each to each word as you in the document

00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,160
it's basically you've typed in a search

00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,160
and it's trying to figure out what

00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,380
search you actually meant to type in the

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,540
first iteration was basically user types

00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,219
of search into the website we take each

00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,129
word run it by a spell we using the

00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:53,379
stock a spell dictionaries and we took

00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:55,360
the top result for each word and showed

00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:56,620
the user that one apparently people tell

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,030
me that it doesn't actually make sense

00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,829
to do spell check in languages like

00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:04,839
Chinese and Japanese i can either

00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:07,090
confirm nor deny this a spell basically

00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,009
takes the word you typed in generates a

00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,330
phonetic version specifics the language

00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:11,560
you specify so it actually has different

00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,020
format ization rules for different

00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,280
languages and complaints computes the

00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,720
levenshtein distance between what you

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,460
typed in the words it thinks might match

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,659
as well as the Levantine distance

00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,890
between the phonetic version of what you

00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:22,750
typed and the phonetic versions of the

00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,950
words they think that means that returns

00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,070
an ordered list of the words it thinks

00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,409
that you met there's a short diversion

00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:31,210
into what leverage sign distance is not

00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:33,040
a numeric measure of how many changes

00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:35,500
are required to change one word into

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,759
another and here's an example of the

00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,009
left-hand leverage time distance between

00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,960
kitten and sitting and you can see it's

00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:45,220
11 in distance of three because there's

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,860
three changes required so what are the

00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,090
problems one of the problems is that the

00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,799
dictionaries that come with a spell

00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,600
don't have any proper nouns which is the

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,689
big ones are like human names and place

00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,070
names it also doesn't know it has no

00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:58,990
idea of what words are common or

00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,399
uncommon so if you type in something

00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,860
that's very similar to an uncommon

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,479
extremely uncommon word it'll say you

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,439
must have met this word but probably you

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,290
didn't because that's a very very

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,239
uncommon word it also doesn't know what

00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:12,070
words go together so it may suggest

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,720
words that on the surface each word

00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,250
makes sense by itself but the two words

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,069
are very unlikely to appear next to each

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:22,550
other in a search hmmm we can fix this

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:24,830
so the first problem was making

00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,660
a dictionary of proper nouns basically I

00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,910
took a pretty minimal approach to this

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,190
and went through the US census data and

00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,700
they have lists of the top thousand men

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,840
of female and male names and surnames we

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,150
made dictionaries out of that data and

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,210
also it got place names out of US Postal

00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,920
Service data turns out that place names

00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,330
are different in different languages so

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,340
we only dealt with this for English

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,900
right now but eventually we'll actually

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,560
have to go and get place names in all

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,640
the different languages so the first

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,650
problem is about a spell doesn't know

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,060
what words are common or uncommon common

00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,320
or uncommon but we do so I basically

00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,460
pulled one year of searches from

00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,530
shutterstock which was millions of

00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,780
searches and we need a big storable hash

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:06,020
of each word so the frequency of

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,940
occurring the most common word is

00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,820
something like woman and that occurs in

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,320
about five or ten percent of searches so

00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,980
we normalize that's a one otherwise all

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,240
the numbers will be very very small and

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,660
so really uncommon words have a

00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,430
frequency very close to zero so about

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,840
what words go together we took the same

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,330
one year of searches from shutterstock

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,670
and basically counted the Coker's is

00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,410
what words appear together we stored

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,820
this is a big storable tookie hash where

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,260
the first word is the first key is the

00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,239
first word the second key is the second

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,070
word and then the value stored there is

00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,870
how often they occur together we also

00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,700
normalize this the same way between zero

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,230
and one so for example cute puppy is a

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,840
very high Curren that's a fairly common

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:48,370
search and porpoise tile is a very very

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:53,890
low occurrence probably actually zero

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:56,060
wait a second so putting it all together

00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:59,330
basically we circularly take that this

00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,220
is a many hours to render this also we

00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,959
take each word they types we pass into a

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,430
spell with our custom dictionaries we

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,320
get back a ranked list of the top or

00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,510
twenty top ten or twenty words that a

00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,700
spell thinks and we basically rearrange

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,320
those based on how frequent each word is

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,880
and the co-occurrences of those words

00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,140
appearing together we can only use

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,739
co-occurrences if there's multiple words

00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:21,680
in the search there's a lot of stuff i

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:23,690
skipped here we recompute when we get

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,010
things out of a spell it's already

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,990
merged together the weights of the

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,030
phonetic distance and the non phonetic

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,070
distance so we basically recompute that

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,390
so we can tease them apart and mix in

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,360
the frequency and co-occurrence data

00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,169
more intelligently when I spent a bunch

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,550
of time on the side

00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:39,770
that if it's a multi word search the

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,900
co-occurrence data is much more valuable

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,939
than the raw frequency data because just

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,539
because a word is common doesn't mean it

00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:50,960
appears within word next to it and also

00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:52,669
we could use co-occurrences of the

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,229
keywords and the descriptions of photos

00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:55,909
to basically steer people tools not

00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:58,039
towards what other people have searched

00:04:55,909 --> 00:05:00,889
on but to steer them towards what people

00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:02,090
what we have pictures of I chose not to

00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:03,740
do this because I favorite it was more

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,389
accurate to try and figure out what they

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,560
were trying to type then you steer them

00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:11,240
towards what we happen to have pictures

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,289
of also you know basically eighty

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,509
percent of the searches are twenty

00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:16,810
percent of the words so you have a kind

00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:19,729
of a long tail if you take a graph of

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,080
the frequency of each word so we perform

00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:23,150
a lot of smoothing to kind of smooth

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,270
this out otherwise the numbers wind

00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,680
above push you to the left here's an

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,020
actual example of the data that comes

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,539
back to the server this is an English

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:42,379
search on Russian battleship misspelled

00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:44,569
you can actually see this with not

00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:47,449
confidence but likelihood of this beep

00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:48,740
typed in and then we also give you if

00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,870
you want to tease it out that you can

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,819
also see well how how lightens do you

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,349
think this is Miss way people correct

00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:56,029
son for battleship are what do we think

00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:57,589
the correct spellings for Russian are

00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:59,419
and this is interesting it actually says

00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:01,219
that thinks that Rustin is spelled

00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:04,610
correctly well it's still suggesting

00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:07,279
Corrections which is actually because it

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,999
says that word are USS i n-never appears

00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,949
the battleship but Russian does and here

00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:13,969
is it actually on big stock website we

00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:16,099
haven't actually integrate this into

00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:17,930
shutterstock yet so there's a search for

00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:19,129
Russian battleship misspelled and it

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,710
says did you mean Russian battleship

00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,089
this is a search on Angelina Jolie which

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,620
is actually one of the test cases I did

00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:27,289
and you can see it actually correctly

00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,099
suggests did you mean Angelina Jolie and

00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:30,099
that's all I got

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,440
take this MacDowell I'm in Wisconsin

00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:24,719
I was waiting my turn all right so this

00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:26,819
is great I don't think I need to go into

00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:29,959
that too terribly much mousex is great

00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:33,119
usually it has its pros and it's cons

00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:34,919
generally that's also a pretty big thing

00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,050
so we leave that as an exercise for the

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,240
reader however a couple of them that we

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,889
can touch on is that moose extensions

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,919
don't always play well together for

00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:45,689
whatever reasons oftentimes you don't

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,449
know about a helpful in this extension

00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:50,789
just because you have never seen it or

00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:53,759
run into it before and you have to use

00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:56,539
them explicitly everywhere you want to

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,339
use them which can lead into ambiguities

00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:00,930
so I think it's fair to say that most

00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:02,819
people using news from the regular basis

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,499
probably have a couple miss extensions

00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,269
that they reach for on a regular basis

00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:08,669
even some things that leverage moves

00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:12,330
like games face auto clean but isn't

00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:15,300
explicitly in imax that generally leads

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:18,589
into work flow along these lines now you

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,479
start out simple than as you add more

00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:24,029
you know you add more and more lines

00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:26,699
from there up the top throwing in

00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:29,159
different moose extensions you know then

00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,479
again you refactor thing the subscriber

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:34,139
you know you want to add and other

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,810
things you accidentally create bugs by

00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:40,649
mistyping a builder things along those

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:42,959
lines now and then add additional MX

00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:46,019
modules to help account for that too and

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,329
clean that up and that you just have to

00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,889
do that everywhere you don't always know

00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,970
what you're going to see or what you're

00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:52,529
going to have or what you're going to

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:57,060
have available you end up scrolling up

00:08:52,529 --> 00:09:00,410
to the top constantly reindeer is a

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,660
collection of some of the more popular

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:05,550
subjectively popular news extensions it

00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,980
rolls in several different ones that

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,360
allow you to you know just do this the

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,069
moment you see use reindeer you know

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,209
that these different moose extensions

00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:16,380
are unbundled in so reindeer is just a

00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:19,590
collection of trade some sugar

00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:22,020
composed together music exporters it's a

00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:26,730
standard set of useful new Texan again

00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:29,010
big red caveat there that I think I put

00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,870
a useful selection in there but just you

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,760
know there's always different choices to

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,970
make and it's just a drop in for moose

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,380
and moose roll along those lines you

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,360
always know what you're getting right

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,920
off the bat with reindeer you can vary

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,340
it again from there but you have most of

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,470
your antlers in place already you have

00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:50,010
everything from always course which is

00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:52,230
often used attribute shortcuts you can

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,450
always you know initialize things with

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:57,030
with traits because middlesex traits is

00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,920
included we have type libraries that are

00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,830
also bundled in and exported into your

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:05,100
package by default and we also

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:07,650
standardized how you can access optional

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,980
app tribute trades always providing a

00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:15,230
constant alias to used in the trade

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:18,510
century we also pull in some other

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:21,150
imports from I think these are all

00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:24,420
pretty much standard on try tiny path

00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:27,500
class some type constraints functions to

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:30,420
help you create types on the fly and

00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:33,080
that's it this is just reindeer but with

00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,080
larger antlers

00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:46,820
hi hi my name is Roscoe gorgeous from

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,230
dr. ko now I want to tell you that you

00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,440
should use DuckDuckGo as your default

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,150
search engine because we actually don't

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,040
track you we don't give the eyepiece to

00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,870
advertisers we have a zero click info

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,000
box must give you directly informations

00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,940
which are specific to your search term

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,650
and it's hackable you can you can to not

00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,839
and you can give us new plugin so that

00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:18,200
we have more features in our search

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:24,170
engine for you and thanks bag yes hi

00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:26,480
everybody I'm sorry tack so I built a

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:29,660
small little tool for myself for making

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,610
working with get a little bit easier but

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,250
to before i can describe that tool i

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,420
need to describe why I made the tool and

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:38,029
there's this thing called get flow and

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,990
I'm happy to explain it but what I'm

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:40,790
actually going to explain this called

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,760
get flourish because we kind of deviate

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:48,740
from the the standard get flow it at

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,780
infinity so here we have a master branch

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,660
which we always use to make releases

00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:56,270
from so you always you're always

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,300
releasing from master and then we branch

00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:01,160
off of that to create integration

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,070
branches so these were all the features

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,660
will land and then when integration

00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,450
branches then we merge it in and that's

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,460
it so when we want to start a new

00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:13,190
feature or fix a bug we create a new

00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:15,920
branch off of Master we add some commits

00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:20,150
to it and then we merge it into release

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,050
and then releases qaid and and it goes

00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,880
through our continuous integration

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,470
server and all that and we want to do it

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,470
again with the new you know maybe a bug

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,880
fix it goes into release and then you

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,790
know a couple days passed and we decide

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,350
Oh we'll make a release I will actually

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,480
release this release so we merge it's a

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:39,279
master and then our build system goes

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:42,080
through and produces a package to deploy

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,400
but then when we're done you know we

00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,459
don't need these branches anymore so we

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,020
get rid of them if we want to change

00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:50,810
things after the fact we just continue

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:52,690
working with new branches and then we

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,490
start over again with the next release

00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,350
so that's kind of how get flow works and

00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,490
the reason this exists is because when

00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,590
you're working with the team you can't

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,840
just have a linear history of people

00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:04,020
committing on top of each other people

00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,920
want to work in separate branches and

00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,320
kind of isolate their changes from

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,480
everybody else if you've seen this

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,720
before this is the actual get flow what

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,490
I just described as get cloche so the

00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,790
reason I built this tool called git

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:22,050
status tackle is to kind of figure out

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:24,160
what's going on here so we have this

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:27,370
this fringe it's been merged into

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,540
release so it's pretty much done and

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,640
then later on we've merged these

00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,980
branches into a master so they're done

00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:37,000
so I kind of want to get into some

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:39,400
visibility to that so for example we

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,380
have this removed junk branch that has a

00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,230
commit on it that hasn't made it made it

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:50,530
to release yet so I will just

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:52,480
demonstrate the tool real quick so right

00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:56,950
now it gives no results but if we touch

00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:00,760
a file it tells us there's a there's an

00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:05,890
untracked file in our posit ori actually

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:08,680
let's check out that junk so we have a

00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,000
new branch and it says it hasn't been

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,040
pushed yet because there's no upstream

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,620
and that's just you know pushing your

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,620
changes to a central server whatever

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:30,160
okay so now we have a commit in its on a

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,260
branch and now we see me that we have an

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:37,120
unmerged feature branch that's going

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:38,530
into release 120 and that's that's kind

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,910
of the state we have here where we have

00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,530
this purple branch that hasn't been

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,660
merged into release yet so it hasn't

00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:47,980
been qaid and it's not scheduled for

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:50,530
release so this this tool kind of lets

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,230
you you get a better picture of what's

00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:55,089
going on with your git repository it's a

00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,670
little bit too big but here we have we

00:14:55,089 --> 00:15:00,550
have other other plugins like working

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:03,730
tree changes which is just it's sort of

00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:06,250
like this but less less junk in it so

00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,870
you have all these lines of explanation

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,270
you don't need to know every single time

00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:12,100
you use this command so this this get

00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:15,910
status tackle thing I made kind of gives

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:18,540
you a more concise and I hope more

00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:22,810
useful view into what your get

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:27,450
repository looks like and it's all built

00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:30,070
on plugins so if you don't like it flow

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,950
I'm sure you could write a plug-in to do

00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:35,170
this branching model or this branching

00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,850
model or this print you know whatever

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,530
whatever works for your team whatever

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,480
your project is using you can use get

00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,310
get set a cycle to kind of build your

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,170
own and shorter if you're here you know

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:50,920
you can do your thing too so if you have

00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:52,900
a specific project need you can write

00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,780
your own little plugin and it works with

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,490
Sipan it's all pro modules so if you

00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,240
like you want to check it out that's

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,240
that's how you get it

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:11,839
hello everybody I'm Ingrid's I'm from

00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,850
booking.com in Amsterdam as you may know

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,889
we are hiring so if you're interested

00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,629
for working for us we want to invite you

00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:20,360
to have some beers tomorrow with us

00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:22,730
tomorrow night at 6pm we only have a few

00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,589
spots available so you can sign up with

00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,389
me today after the talks will be in your

00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:27,740
back or you can come tomorrow at our

00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:42,769
stand there will be in the next building

00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:47,389
thank you hello this slide this is all

00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:50,540
old mo here so this is um I'm really big

00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:52,189
on tidying I read an essay once which

00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,720
said that there's really no reason for

00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:55,459
us to have all these different code

00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,839
standards and we would all just get

00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:58,759
along better with our teams if we just

00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,649
decided on you know standardizing on

00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:02,449
code standards and all these kinds of

00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:04,610
things like cruel tidy and pod tidy and

00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:06,140
so on I'm a big fan of applying these to

00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,850
my code repository and I get sick of

00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,470
applying all the different ones and

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,909
remembering how they work and one of

00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,890
them spits out errors to this and one of

00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:14,630
them you know crosses the file in place

00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,699
and so on and so on so I kind of wanted

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:18,709
one thing to just unify all these tight

00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:22,549
ears and validators and run them in one

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:30,200
place so what I wrote was called tidy

00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:35,030
all yeah where am I Oh a minute demo

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:41,270
directory okay all right now well that's

00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:43,789
running I'll show you the config file so

00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,799
basically this this can take any kind of

00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:48,140
any kind of tight ear in other words

00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:50,480
something that modifies a code in some

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,270
way such as not to modify its semantics

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,460
so HTML tidy pod tidy pearl tidy that

00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,200
kind of thing and then any validator so

00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,730
anything that looks at your code and

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,530
determines if it's correct or not and

00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:04,130
spits out warnings not correct so pro

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:06,830
critic and XML lint and you know pod

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:10,159
checking and so on so in this example

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:12,049
I'm using Pro tidy with you know my

00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,059
preferred arguments and my own pro tidy

00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,950
class i'm using pod tidy with just a

00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,220
default configuration and i'm using

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,799
cruel critic and

00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,419
using severity 5 and I and these all

00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,409
have sort of default includes if you

00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,210
don't specify anything so by default

00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:27,630
this will look for all the files that

00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,919
have p ltd p.m. on pro critic i'm

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,030
deciding just to process the lives

00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,549
because pro critics slower than the

00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,659
others and so if i get to the bottom it

00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:35,730
looks like an examined all these files

00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:37,919
and there were a couple places where it

00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,000
tidied some files so if it's a tidy that

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,080
means it actually changed its have

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,940
examined it means it didn't have to

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,710
change it and then we get to the bottom

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,169
and we see a couple of pro critic errors

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,700
now the nice thing is this will cash so

00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:49,280
it will only process the files if they

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:54,809
change since the last time we tidy them

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:58,470
so if i run this again it should only

00:18:54,809 --> 00:19:01,289
print out the two that are here and if i

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,669
go and fix these so I'm not doing make

00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:03,929
immutable these are actually real errors

00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:09,890
by the way that I've just found out

00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:13,350
while is preparing this talk there right

00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:16,799
I wonder I can never remember to take

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:19,200
that so I fixed that and that one fixed

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:24,510
and and now if I run it again it should

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,559
only be the winner and so on and I can

00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,840
fix this one as well and then I get a

00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,700
clean bill of health and if I change any

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,470
of my configuration or if I change any

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,450
of the files underneath look if I go

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:39,270
here and I just touch live you know

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:41,280
startup him and run it then it's going

00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,600
to examine you know cheetah well that

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,950
was a bad example but you know you

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:50,460
understand you understand the point um

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:55,620
yeah so um so the nice thing about this

00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:57,059
is I I like to do this whenever I commit

00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,950
so there's a lot of like test modules

00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:00,809
out there like test Heidi and test

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,400
critic and all this stuff that runs when

00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:03,720
you when you that that do it when you

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,429
run your tests well that's fine but

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,539
doesn't actually fix your files so then

00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:08,250
you see your test fails and you have to

00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,840
go and fix your files there's other

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,950
things like dis Zilla that will you know

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,960
dis little plugins that will do this for

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,030
you I prefer to do this right when I

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,770
commit my code and I prefer when my team

00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,090
do this as well so I think that you

00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,950
should not have commits that look like

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,780
commit followed by a night I did it

00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,460
commit I tied it at commit i titled it

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,780
oh I fixed the Pearl critic I just want

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,789
the commits to be nice and clean so

00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,620
before I run every commit I just run

00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:30,550
this since it's nice in cash it will

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,070
only look at the files that are changed

00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:49,780
and and then that way all my commits a

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:51,580
nice and clean I've never seen a change

00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,290
every time you try to try to I've never

00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,700
encountered that that what I have

00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,170
encountered is that sometimes it'll

00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,730
change it the first time and so I

00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,560
actually submitted this change to

00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,330
protons in iterations where you could

00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,830
have it run twice it will run three

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,810
times or whatever and usually it settles

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,960
down I've never seen it flip flop but

00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,770
congratulations if you discover that

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,790
I've been using for without you about

00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,380
ten years I've never I've never

00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:18,090
discovered anything that will do that so

00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:18,090
so that you should be proud okay thanks

00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:29,200
I'm David I'm a PDL guy and I would just

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,090
like to get all the pearls scientists in

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,020
the room after the lightning talks if we

00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:36,820
could meet up I the piano so most of you

00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:39,400
yeah well sure but most of you aren't

00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,530
scientists and you know I want to meet

00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,190
each other so by the piano after

00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,190
lightning talks

00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:11,970
no it's ready well got it okay

00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:26,680
modernizing pearl automatically soap on

00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:30,880
the web greetings from the pearl 16 my

00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:33,280
name is Bruce gray I go by util and I've

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,880
been working for about four years on

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:45,760
blue tiger which is a pro 5 to Perl 6

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:48,790
translator it's based in PPI rather than

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:53,350
the mad based one that Larry and Nathan

00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:56,650
are working on and for years I started

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:59,050
you know going in to get about a year

00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,580
ago and then went into black hole so

00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:04,060
there's a lot of code that I have that's

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:07,480
not an git yet and what I'm going to

00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:11,490
talk about what you care about is not

00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,490
implement it but trust me it'll work

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:16,960
problem i hit actually in the shower

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,070
realized oh my god i've been working on

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,230
this all these years and I never

00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:23,340
considered what happens if you throw

00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:28,030
non-strict code at the translator

00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:29,680
because Perl 6 defaults to strict and I

00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,450
take long showers by the end of the

00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,780
shower I knew what the algorithm should

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,780
be

00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:42,990
to essentially figure out like four f3

00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,970
it's used in two different blocks but

00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,650
there's an assignment the first time if

00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,840
she's in each block there for those are

00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:51,540
separate variables that can be my header

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,220
it's catching it midstream layer and

00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,320
using it below that needs to be above

00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,580
the block that's declared in it doesn't

00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,650
need to be above the if block because

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:01,500
that's a conditional so I've got that

00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:04,560
algorithm pretty solid and when I

00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:09,360
started telling people a lie on the way

00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:13,380
down to a peregrine / l'oasis I realized

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:16,290
hey that sounds useful for like in in

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,780
Perl 5 forget Perl 6 have any of you

00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,220
gotten thrown non street code that you

00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,480
had to make strict just the very first

00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,180
thing that you did to start working on

00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,880
it right and show hands good that's

00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,250
encouraging and that was encouraging to

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,870
Peregrine said people will love you and

00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,930
guru said I'm going to make a Padre

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:37,380
plugin from that and raffle said and

00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:40,110
blew my mind well what if we ship ship a

00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,450
related tool can your thing be expanded

00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:45,180
so that we don't just have pearl Delta

00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:46,770
you can actually run a live program that

00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,780
is pearl Delta to scan all of your code

00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:52,520
to see if this version of Perl is going

00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:55,770
to break any of your stuff amazing so

00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:59,480
the point of all this is these are just

00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:02,970
people who overheard discussions about

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,530
this project and I realized that I don't

00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:07,530
know enough about the way this could be

00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:10,950
applied to ride it the first time right

00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:13,830
therefore i'm part of hallway plus plus

00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:16,920
i'm very interrupted even if you see me

00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:18,720
working on my talk for day 3 please

00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,670
interrupt me if you have ideas about

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,260
this or needs or desires or whatever

00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:26,700
because i need that input and if i run

00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,020
into another black hole of time you

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:33,390
might be the person that I hand this

00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:35,910
over to the concept from four years ago

00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:38,940
was translation and then as I saw how do

00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:42,990
you how you have to expand the the

00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,820
management of your entire code base the

00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,070
concept became migration and now with

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:50,220
this profile to Perl 5 translation

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:52,409
the concept is modernization so that's

00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,320
the progress that have made conceptually

00:25:52,409 --> 00:26:00,169
over that for years therefore I am

00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:03,350
claiming the namespace pearl modernize

00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:06,480
other people are working in the same

00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:09,600
conceptual domain Casey West gave a talk

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,370
at Pro oasis on how he used extensions

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,460
to Pearl critic that he wrote to do

00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:20,750
automatic scans of CGI for known

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:23,970
problems cert is entering this realm

00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:25,940
across other languages non pearl there

00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:29,190
is this site program transforms

00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:31,289
transformation org that if you have any

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,539
interest in this that's worth checking

00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:37,230
out because this is simultaneously

00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:39,870
occurring and and yes occurring to

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:43,950
people in a lot of languages especially

00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:46,039
our dynamic language cousins so I

00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,899
encourage you to think along this line

00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:50,370
develop related code we had pearl critic

00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,500
we have pearl tidy they've been around

00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,220
for a long time and we're only just now

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,350
seeing the next generation of such tools

00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:00,809
the Renaissance continues I think this

00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,279
is going to be an important part this

00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:07,100
concept will be important part of the

00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:07,100
continuing pearl Renaissance thank

00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:39,919
this is an ad for ad please during the

00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:42,839
next talk I've got a lovely assistant

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,029
I'm and refresh I'm working with Grant

00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:47,399
at Grant Street and I'm here to talk

00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:49,919
about testify which they started

00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:53,999
internally because we have a lot of apps

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:58,919
that are not really testable because

00:27:53,999 --> 00:28:00,569
they're older code and just not well

00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,479
written so we had to find a way to test

00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:05,279
them internally or test them with

00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:09,719
something like selenium that sort of

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:12,989
thing and we wanted to make it easier to

00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:16,709
do so we can't they wanted to have a

00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:21,029
plain English way to write these tests

00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:23,219
to allow other people who could to

00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:26,940
create them so the test can look

00:28:23,219 --> 00:28:28,199
something like this and then you can

00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:32,039
handle the idea was you could hand the

00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:34,619
test to somebody else or to a person and

00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:36,719
they could follow the steps and perform

00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:39,389
the test for you except they're not very

00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:44,519
trustworthy so we want to do it in the

00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:45,869
cloud so you send the test to us we run

00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:47,940
it in multiple different browsers

00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:53,039
they're working on different operating

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:56,879
systems and so then you get the results

00:28:53,039 --> 00:29:01,469
back same sort of plain English same

00:28:56,879 --> 00:29:05,669
sort of idea the then they you also can

00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:09,769
get screenshots and for every step of

00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:12,809
the way or just for failures if you want

00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:15,479
we figure this will be useful for CEOs

00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:19,199
as well as developers your clients and

00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:23,429
business analysts because everybody

00:29:19,199 --> 00:29:24,669
should be able to read it our advanced

00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:27,730
commands are

00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:30,700
not super advanced because the idea is

00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:33,190
to keep it fairly simple so we know

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:36,580
things about the different objects on a

00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:39,399
webpage like buttons and links and text

00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:43,629
and things like that you can remember

00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:47,950
different values on that are on a

00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:50,710
webpage for later you can check things

00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:56,139
based on where they are in a table you

00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:58,059
can look them up by their XPath they're

00:29:56,139 --> 00:30:00,460
adding all sorts of different ideas like

00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:04,419
whether the text on the webpage is

00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:06,909
spelled correctly you can take that

00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:09,009
amount that we remembered before applied

00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:14,859
transformations to it and compare it to

00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:16,840
other values you can find links by

00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:21,749
ordinal that sort of thing where they

00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:25,210
are on the page and then you can create

00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:27,399
or what we're looking for the beta

00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:30,519
testers so that you can come up with

00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:33,759
ideas as to what commands you want to

00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:37,840
add to this one of the powerful things

00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:40,600
that we like is that idea of phrases

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:44,289
which are kind of subroutines so you

00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:46,090
have a section of code that you do for

00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:50,909
every test that you want to run make

00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:54,159
somebody login so logging to testify

00:30:50,909 --> 00:30:56,710
then your test just becomes much shorter

00:30:54,159 --> 00:31:02,049
much more repeatable you update in one

00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:04,539
place that sort of thing the reason that

00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:05,980
or we're putting us in a cloud one of

00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:10,960
the things that we hope will be helpful

00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:14,710
is to have sharing of tests and phrases

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,019
so that if say you're you host web app

00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,980
that other people use you can provide

00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:23,200
them with phrases for your web app and

00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,480
they can then test their version of your

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,299
web app to make sure that their website

00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:31,239
that they're hosting on your product is

00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:33,519
performing as they expect it to we have

00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:37,929
a selenium converter that will take in

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:41,080
your selenium tests and output them

00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:44,740
turn them into the plain English that we

00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,690
recognize lots of different reports like

00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:50,940
how your tests compared to yesterday

00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:55,720
today or and things of that nature and

00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:57,909
we have a web interface to it wrappers

00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:02,049
in several different languages obviously

00:31:57,909 --> 00:32:05,379
pearl and we think that it'll be useful

00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:06,850
for testing compliance documentation

00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:08,470
because you can write a compliance

00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:10,860
document and then actually run the

00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:14,619
document and prove that it works

00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:17,440
automation of things and much much more

00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:20,529
that hopefully everybody else comes up

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,139
with some great ideas for you can go

00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:26,080
right now to testify Kawasaki ops ii and

00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:28,799
become a free beta tester first 50

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,730
people bypass the waiting list

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:37,539
supposedly it works now hey it works out

00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:43,029
so come by our booth you can sign up for

00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:45,480
a chance to win an ipad and a t-shirt

00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:45,480
side

00:32:48,490 --> 00:33:02,650
so thank you hello everyone my name is

00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:06,370
URI I am the pearl hunter I hunt down

00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:08,860
pearl people and kill them dead as you

00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:10,960
might know I place pearl people place

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,360
several people who are sitting here work

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,910
for Veda companies here that are

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,950
advertising work with me chances are

00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,510
you'll get a job better and easier with

00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,210
helpful all kinds of things the contact

00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:23,830
Major want to help get a job or you want

00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:34,510
to help find people for pearl jobs

00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:39,130
Thanks right hey i'm randall schwartz

00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:41,980
yay hi guys so problem is you got a test

00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:43,300
right solution of course is test amor

00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,720
and friends thank you Michael and the

00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:49,120
entire team but what about scripts the

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,880
works or test more the problem is the

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,440
scripts are separate processes so it's

00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,340
hard to mock things it's hard to modify

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,580
the way the things are actually running

00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:00,130
inside the script solution is don't use

00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:03,670
a separate process require your script

00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:06,130
directly need T file but how do you

00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,600
invoke it then the problem is that the

00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:10,119
loose code in your script is effectively

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,129
the main of your severe code solution

00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,440
for that is you bundle all your loose

00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:16,389
code into a run subroutine you call it

00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,859
mean if you want to like run though you

00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,790
also ensure there's a true value at the

00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:20,560
end of the script because you're going

00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:23,169
to be using require with it now rather

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,450
than working it separately but whose

00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:27,190
could invoke run then there's your

00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,740
problem how do you invoke run when you

00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:32,590
run normally but not invoke run when you

00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:35,619
pull them via requiring UT solution

00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:37,419
there is is collar if callers false that

00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:39,909
means we're being run as a script so

00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:43,060
runs passing RV to that subroutine if

00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:45,100
caller is true then it does nothing but

00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,720
then what about the namespace the dot T

00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,879
file you don't want your program global

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,730
so the scripture testing to collide with

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,290
your dot T files things so how do we

00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,000
take care of that solution of course is

00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,820
to bring your script into its own

00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,210
package begin package program I'll

00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,099
Global's in

00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,990
in your script now our program colon

00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,480
colon something don't forget that died I

00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:07,970
forget that died it fails silently very

00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,859
bad but then how do you invoke the

00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,900
program from the tests so you want to

00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:14,570
make it run just like you're executing

00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,190
the script passing in an RB solution is

00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,230
that you simply invoke program coal and

00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,550
coal and run inside your test he pass at

00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,839
the RV and then it does what it normally

00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,240
would have done if those were passed on

00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:26,240
the command line but then what about

00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,640
exceptions what if the program run calls

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,839
died what if it calls exit how do we

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,940
capture standard out and things like

00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,980
that so problem is you want to trap

00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:36,080
everything not just died so eval doesn't

00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,700
cut it if I will take care of die but it

00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,080
won't take care of exit it won't take

00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,580
care of the script well we'll take head

00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,930
is kept putting off the end it doesn't

00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:45,619
do a lot of the other stuff either so

00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:46,790
solution is that done test trap I only

00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:48,320
found out about this about three months

00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:51,440
ago it's been the cpn for a couple years

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,630
it's like eval on steroids you bring in

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,520
test trap and that trap block will

00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:58,970
capture every way that that code could

00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,080
exit die exit all staff Diago steady

00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,849
there and so on we'll get to that in a

00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,859
second so how do I know how the code

00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:06,290
finished them from that trap block was

00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:09,260
it a normal exit was it the call to exit

00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:11,720
or was it die the solution is that the

00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,970
used trap also created a trap object

00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,160
that has attributes you can look at a

00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:17,930
trap exit to see what the exit code was

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,820
if any if it didn't exit it will be

00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,650
undef you can see what the dye message

00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,849
was that it through all sorts of ways

00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:24,320
whatever way you can get out of there

00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:27,230
the attributes will tell you how it

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,730
worked but what about standard out what

00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:30,490
about standard error what about warnings

00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,200
so how do we get to those things

00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:35,540
solution is a test trap also captures

00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,710
those it has the output variable

00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,030
standard out variable will be any

00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:39,470
standard out that was sent during the

00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,510
execution standard error leading

00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:42,980
standard error and all the Warrens are

00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:44,750
captured it separate invocation so you

00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,820
can see how many times it warned and we

00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:49,010
teach you the messages were all for you

00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,220
automatically so what about stubbing or

00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:54,440
mocking what about being able to

00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:56,900
override some functionality of behavior

00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,170
inside the code simple monkey Patchett

00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:01,730
okay is simply inside your test you say

00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:03,410
local programs have cell vehicles that

00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,240
sub you want to have obviously is

00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:06,680
requires some cooperation some white box

00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,530
testing you're not doing black box here

00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,880
okay but what about standard in I show

00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,140
you had a capture standard on standard

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,370
error what about standard in

00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:15,380
solution you can do an in-memory

00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:16,820
standard in handle and it works very

00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,740
well so you can just load up stuff into

00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,970
a normally handle and it reads it like

00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,590
it's really standard in you can even a

00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:23,870
pin lines to it and so on look at more

00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:26,030
than one time what about changed her

00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:27,590
well that's a problem change to his

00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,420
level affect you will change your inside

00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:31,550
your run code now it will modify your

00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,530
naughty file solution is the test trap

00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:36,290
is amazingly pluggable so within about

00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:38,870
20 minutes i wrote a sub working or plug

00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:40,730
called TWD and it traps any change or

00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,960
within that script it even lets you set

00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,640
it to a specific directory when it

00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,200
starts and tells you what the directory

00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,210
was it ended up at all well using

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,770
attributes see my blog for this little

00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,270
plugin or might be corner i set this

00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:52,130
idea to the author of pet strap you

00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:54,110
really liked it but does this really

00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,940
work for all scripts no because the

00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:58,010
script might need complex interaction

00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,510
maybe you can't edit the code maybe

00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,850
you're not allowed to create a sub run

00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,680
with all the loose code in it code my

00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:05,450
fork test trap does near forks very well

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,860
solution is y a traditional sub

00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,080
processes may be combined would expect

00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:11,710
but test your app is amazingly useful

00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,710
thank you

00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:27,869
Oh me again hey what I wanted to say an

00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:30,570
additional is that a first we have the

00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:32,610
banks so when you go an explanation mark

00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:34,790
g after your search term you are

00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:38,700
directly very redirected to Google and

00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:41,040
so can access hundred fifty other search

00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,630
engines also directly which is very

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,430
handy for many people who have don't

00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:47,520
want to configure their browser every

00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:49,290
time for the search terms easy way

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,360
shortcuts and the other thing I want to

00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:53,340
say is that we make a jacket on the

00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,020
Kraken tech we call it where we have one

00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,840
day of talks and one day of hacking at

00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:00,450
the doctor go headquarter the three you

00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,190
can all come if you want and even though

00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:04,890
we have limited size of people there so

00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:07,410
we have place for 30 people or so but

00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:10,260
the food is free and yes we would like

00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:14,990
to see many of you it's at the 30s June

00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:18,720
to the first rely on this weekend at

00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:23,520
Philadelphia Sorry Sorry it's a around

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:25,530
Philadelphia exactly powerless thanks

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,910
and if you need more information just

00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,910
come to me and talk with me and I

00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:40,870
uh no it's not about clouds it's about

00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:45,130
hardware because some of you may have

00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:47,160
heard I'm kind of interested in the run

00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:51,100
the hardware hackathon rigging pearl

00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:53,290
involved in hardware so if you haven't

00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,990
been by the hardware hackathon I hope

00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:57,880
you stop by because I personally think

00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:59,530
it's really cool stuff and i hope this

00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,760
community comes up with even more cool

00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:06,550
stuff that i can't even dream up yet if

00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,870
you didn't know just like we have open

00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:10,480
source software we now have an

00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:11,920
open-source standard for hardware kind

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,520
of the poster child for that is the

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,570
Arduino platform which is really awesome

00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,610
but there's other stuff coming and

00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,140
there's other stuff out there but just

00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:21,640
to let you know that there's open source

00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:25,180
stuff happening in a hardware if you did

00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,680
not know that anyway so what I'm really

00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,210
interested in is Hardware hackathon some

00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,470
people get kind of confused and that

00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,610
happens and that's what we're having

00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:33,910
these hackathons and that's why I'm

00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:35,440
talking here other places is well some

00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:37,210
people think they want to put pearl on

00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,860
Arduino or some other kind of embedded

00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:41,200
device which hey that's cool let's do

00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:44,080
some of that but more than that you know

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,500
pearl has been doing that forever right

00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:50,140
we'd like to make things easy well I

00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,450
wanted you to think about what a

00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,500
peripheral is it's not your printer it's

00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,120
not your keyboard a thought your mouse

00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,790
well it is but it's not just those

00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,650
things it's not just a scanner I want us

00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:01,030
to extend our idea of what a peripheral

00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:03,220
is to your computer do anything

00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:05,860
connected to the Internet to your

00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:07,570
doorbell some of you pricing so my talk

00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:10,290
and I've got to kind of a follow up on

00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:13,900
it that I'm giving now or tomorrow about

00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:17,260
how when you ring my doorbell I get a

00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:20,500
text message which it was way easier to

00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,870
do that than to run a actual physical

00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:25,720
bell to the third floor of my house to

00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:27,940
then run the bail out to my backyard to

00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,440
run the bell to my neighbors or to the

00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,120
playground near my house which in all

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,060
those cases I'm pretty much home with

00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,320
someone rings my bell and I get a little

00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,730
text message which is everywhere

00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,960
although it's really handy when I'm here

00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,320
in a good a text message did someone

00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,600
ring my bell but um

00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,550
you know whatever so I want us to think

00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,760
about what the peripherals are and so I

00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:50,370
want to end up making you know easy to

00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,250
making the easy things easy for and that

00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:55,440
but with hardware and I learned us to

00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:57,600
like once we start to get tooled up for

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,850
this you know lots of stuff will fall

00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,100
out crop that's easy edge call that

00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,960
module and link this together and pipe

00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,520
that together and we've seen the wonders

00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,440
you know what we can do with web

00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,690
services and just using good old bash

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,950
and we've got the right you know perl

00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:15,480
modules in place to do some really

00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:17,070
awesome stuff so you know I certainly

00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,800
want some help some of that stuff gluing

00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:21,210
these things together we have lots of

00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,530
scientists that apparently are going to

00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,700
meet over at the piano right because

00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:27,780
there's like a thousand of you that are

00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:29,520
going to be over there so I don't know

00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,810
what kind of scientist you're doing but

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,930
some of these scientists actually works

00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:36,720
with hardware and they get to use really

00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:39,360
expensive equipment to in some cases

00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,880
just talk to serial ports and spit out

00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:44,310
some chrome with reading of the serial

00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,590
port so serial port plus protocol equal

00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:48,690
expensive software in many cases and I

00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:50,640
highly suspect pearl could do some of

00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:54,180
that with a little dancer app and do

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:57,690
just as well in many cases in all cases

00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:59,730
no or at least not probably easily but I

00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:01,620
think there's a real vacuum that we

00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:02,910
could fill their that people didn't even

00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,290
think about things they could be doing

00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:06,750
with the stuff in their labs if they

00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:09,330
could I don't know script their things

00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:11,370
in their lab on a unix pipeline that

00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:13,410
seems really crazily powerful for me in

00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:14,760
some cases so but we need modules we

00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:17,190
need like multimeter I don't know

00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,080
multimeter abstract and you know how do

00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,400
you talk to a fluke meter and how do you

00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,310
talk to all these things and make it

00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,770
easy because I bet most of you unlike me

00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:27,810
never set baud rates and you know all

00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:29,460
that kind of stuff with parity bits and

00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:31,710
all that fun days running your mom's

00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,750
phone bill up to 700 bucks in one month

00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:36,300
because you didn't know this stuff but

00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:41,070
you still remember 7-6 3 to 4 comma 264

00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:43,860
compras hurt anyone compuserve anyway um

00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:46,110
so I had to stop for a while where I was

00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:48,470
doing some testing of hardware and I got

00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:48,470
to do this

00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,720
plug it back up so basically i was doing

00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:56,790
is unplugging the power supply and

00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,040
restarting it so that kind of stocks are

00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:01,200
scripted it I took a large we know with

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,750
the relay I put a little button who hit

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,480
the button it waits five seconds powers

00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:08,610
back up the device and I go on with life

00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,350
crazy simple stuff I had some people in

00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:11,730
the hackathon that thought oh I can't do

00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:13,770
hardware I'm not going to mention names

00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:15,450
hopefully they might and evangelize a

00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:17,430
little bit for me but they were like

00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:19,290
whoa I can't do hardware and it turns

00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,760
out about five minutes they were turning

00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:22,350
servos or maybe 10 minutes they're

00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,720
returning servos and blinking lights and

00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:26,670
going wow I can do this and you can and

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,100
then you can both rest interfaces to

00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:33,000
stuff Thank You Sawyer for the blog post

00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:35,100
but it's it's really awesome stuff and i

00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,350
hope you get involved and so I have a

00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:39,720
github which absolutely has no repose in

00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:41,490
it but it's an organization so i'll

00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,380
claim the namespace for an organization

00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:45,300
for people who want to join me you can

00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,430
get you know ownership bit instantly

00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:50,340
i'll give it to you i don't care but I

00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:52,080
want people to help me start here let's

00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,510
build some cool stuff let's fill Sipan

00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,430
with cool cool modules to help people

00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:58,140
talk to hardware and come to the

00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:01,520
hardware hack it down I brought lots of

00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,520
stuff for you to play with

00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:15,680
so apparently I have famous people

00:45:13,969 --> 00:45:16,910
watching me on the stream here hi

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,650
Randall will enjoy your lightning dock

00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:20,150
big brother is watching you I really

00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,799
like test Raptors so much that i wrote a

00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:23,660
rapper module probably the last five

00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:24,559
minutes called test effects to automate

00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:28,390
it further just thought you might find

00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,390
it interesting all the best to Damien

00:45:32,019 --> 00:45:37,729
just a quick clarification about the

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,489
contest for the ipad it is an ipad we're

00:45:37,729 --> 00:45:42,979
giving away you go to the job fair

00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:44,719
that's going to be right inside the pile

00:45:42,979 --> 00:45:45,920
building take a left it'll be inside

00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:47,989
that glass room that was right there

00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,930
beside today you'll fill one of these

00:45:47,989 --> 00:45:52,819
out and you put it in the bag and then

00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:56,779
we'll draw one out later in the day and

00:45:52,819 --> 00:46:00,529
we will give out an iPad we will have

00:45:56,779 --> 00:46:02,869
your name and at tomorrow night tomorrow

00:46:00,529 --> 00:46:04,459
afternoon like four o'clock we have will

00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:08,239
you fill out your name and email address

00:46:04,459 --> 00:46:10,190
so I think if you're not present for the

00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:11,599
drawing will probably email it to you

00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:15,229
and tell you that oh you one if you

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:18,739
don't come and claim it then sucks v you

00:46:15,229 --> 00:46:20,119
will give it something else and then we

00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:22,729
also have a fun contest where you can

00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:25,880
put your own wind then claws on here and

00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:28,630
it will will pick the winners and give

00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,630
them t-shirts so

00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:41,040
hey there i'm casey west and apparently

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,930
I'm late which kind of sucks because

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,610
it's a hard act to follow with toys and

00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:47,040
iPads and all that stuff but I want to

00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:50,250
tell you guys about being the TP f4

00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,610
webmaster that's something that I do and

00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:54,690
I wanted to explain why do I need to

00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:59,820
back up from this microphone a little

00:46:54,690 --> 00:47:02,790
bit all right here we go so the pro

00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:07,380
foundation's website WWF and asian org

00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:09,060
is built on a piece of software called

00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,260
social text wiki software there's a

00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:13,290
company called social text they were

00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:16,380
very very awesome in creating an open

00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:18,180
version of their of their system and a

00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,730
friend of mine who worked there many

00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:22,800
years ago set up a version of that for

00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:26,340
the pearl foundation with two goals one

00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,660
of them was to have community wikis

00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,490
available that could be hosted by the

00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,710
the TPF and that would be a service that

00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:33,660
the TBF could provide and the other

00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:36,810
reason was that there was an interesting

00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:39,600
hack to create a website from one of

00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:42,690
these wikis basically using it as a CMS

00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:46,080
and an HTML template editor and that's

00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:49,260
what WWE r fundation org is built on top

00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:52,530
of now this open source version of

00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:54,360
social text is no longer maintained by

00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:56,190
the company they moved on to greener

00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,800
pastures and they're not really doing

00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:00,390
that anymore as far as I understand and

00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,580
the reason that I'm the TPF webmaster is

00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:07,140
because I used to work there and I might

00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:10,470
be able to keep it alive the the system

00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,790
isn't super great right now and there's

00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:14,400
there are two things that are happening

00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:17,730
one is that the website is being run off

00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,580
of the wiki it's not super easy to edit

00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:24,780
that that website for standard human

00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:26,160
beings you know not super geeks then the

00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,780
other thing is happening is there there

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,240
are a couple of community wikis that are

00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,860
still run they're not all the Perl 6

00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,780
wiki is still in use but mostly by

00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:36,660
spammers who have figured out how to

00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:38,910
register create a page upload static

00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,780
HTML attachments that contain links to

00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:41,940
other mal

00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:44,790
and other spam and then delete those

00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,890
pages so nobody noticed so occasionally

00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:49,650
I get emails from google that say your

00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:51,990
site is terrible and we're going to tell

00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:54,660
everybody who uses chrome and then I go

00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:57,060
and fix it so this is my plea I'm

00:48:54,660 --> 00:49:00,390
begging you the community if you guys

00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:02,730
want say a wiki system to run the Perl 6

00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:06,570
wiki or any other wiki the pro/5 wiki is

00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:09,750
now hosted on social texts platform that

00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:12,330
is platform as a service you know

00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:15,240
they're hosting it for us for free maybe

00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:17,670
pro/5 community likes that the p5p folks

00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,820
maybe they don't but if you the

00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:21,870
community would like a wiki system I

00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:24,120
encourage you to build one because i

00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:25,830
have i've offered a number of times to

00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,200
install mediawiki but that's not pearl

00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:29,910
and nobody likes that and then I've

00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,530
offered to install like drupal I don't

00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:34,080
care for the CMS you know to build a

00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:36,990
website for the pearl foundation but

00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,460
again that's not pearl and so you can

00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:40,620
come and talk to me and I'll be happy to

00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,330
explain some of the requirements they're

00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,920
very simple one is a CMS that builds

00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:47,780
websites that's usable by human beings

00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:50,400
the other one is a wiki platform that

00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:54,240
pearl projects and the pearl community

00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:58,290
could use if you guys want one so that's

00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:00,060
my talk I'm just asking you guys to to

00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:03,800
contribute anything that we could

00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:05,640
install that could replace what's now

00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:11,850
non-supported code that's running the

00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:14,070
TPF there's a question of the front yes

00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:16,230
so there's a killer web framework that

00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:18,960
Randall proposed last year in Perl 6 and

00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:22,980
I recommend anyone use that to to build

00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,870
a website no seriously that's all I god

00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:27,750
I can't offer you iPads or toys but I

00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:30,660
could buy you some beer and you know try

00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:33,890
and lubricate you into saying yes so

00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,890
thank you very much

00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,359
ty by my name is Garber and I would like

00:50:40,529 --> 00:50:46,019
to get a show of hands how many of you

00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:48,359
are using windows okay don't be shy okay

00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:50,539
so as I can see that it's about 10,000

00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:55,230
people including the ones watching from

00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:57,900
the field so random mentioned a very

00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:59,760
good module called expect but it doesn't

00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,680
work on windows and the reason it

00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,170
doesn't work on Windows is because

00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,240
natively is because there's a module

00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:08,869
called io TTYL that doesn't work on

00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,760
Windows Windows it does work on cygwin

00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:13,829
but not on windows so I would and

00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,930
actually we're going to check it there's

00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:18,510
about there are about seven to eight

00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:19,980
modules depending on that one that are

00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:24,119
not working on windows because of this

00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:27,359
so I would like to get some help from

00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:31,910
you to take out the code from cygwin

00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:35,599
that that allows io TTYL to work on it

00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:39,260
so it will be able to work natively on

00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,260
strawberry girl thank

00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:50,500
lightning a birth is with in between

00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:52,150
times I just wanted to point out at

00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:55,150
conferences I always get asked if

00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:56,800
Shadowcat actually exists or whether

00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:58,180
it's just a vanity domain which is kind

00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,920
of embarrassing given that there's three

00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:03,160
people from Shadowcat here we're all

00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:05,830
speaking and I just want I just wanted

00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:08,920
to point out that we've had a policy for

00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:10,870
a while where any shadowcats tarthur is

00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,850
allowed to build a certain amount of

00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:14,830
time for helping people out in the

00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:16,510
community so long as they do it in they

00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:17,770
do it with a Shadowcat email signature

00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:20,760
or something so that we can at least

00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:24,690
pretend that it's business related so um

00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:27,100
given we do basically you know hacking

00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:28,600
crucial support for the earth standard

00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,360
sleep and stack them whatever what I'm

00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,890
saying is I can't really you know stand

00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:35,440
up at yep see allows people to give as

00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:38,890
many but i can ask you guys to help my

they can put it they can put it on the

00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:48,790
