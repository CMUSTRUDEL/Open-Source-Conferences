okay welcome to the second half of the

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,539
second half of your first day at UFC

00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,359
this isn't a presentation this is

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,010
getting you a pause ID getting you to

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,960
make a module getting you to upload it

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,900
to see pan there are some people who are

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,119
here who I definitely know where you

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,640
have module in Sipan and there are some

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:36,270
people here who are here to help you do

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,290
this process and I at least I an LCD

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,910
wealth moment have all of the necessary

00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,950
magical powers to enable the things that

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,480
you're going to need to do that so the

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,059
first thing we need to do is get people

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,100
pause accounts pause is the Pearl

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,260
authors upload server which is the

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,690
gateway to see pan don't actually upload

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,850
a Sipan you upload to pause pause does

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,550
some stuff and then Sipan mirrors from

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:03,239
pogs so if you don't already have an

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:06,000
account get your credit cards ready and

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,510
going to pause dr. wheeler you're really

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,659
a double credit card Oh for those of you

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,310
who are new I know this because I

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,509
probably where you mentioned this but

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,049
I've been asked by the organizers to

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,090
mention it again on your way out just

00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:24,180
the tip jar if you can need five dollars

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:28,920
or five euros or whatever that's just

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,299
how we do it at UFC not really that's

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,869
why I be recorded down so they're just

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,420
going to take that sample bite note so

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,930
once you do this every things that are

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,880
set up in pause then I can they go

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,479
approve and you will Vicki and all the

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,340
author that lets say just pause that

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,229
promote work you get anything like this

00:01:47,340 --> 00:02:00,649
there is this request pause the counting

00:01:51,229 --> 00:02:03,060
now if the thing that you want to think

00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:06,090
somewhat carefully about is this desired

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,740
ID because although you can check you

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,349
can get any different egg you later you

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,470
can't modify this ID give it have to

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,610
manually transfer everything which we

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:19,100
you would have to be anybody transfer

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:22,370
everything I think and people confuse so

00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,410
if you're here to help people I like to

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,560
participate in that portion of the thank

00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,090

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,640

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,170

00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,310
you have if you need help or you're

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,870

raise your hand and one of these people

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,970
who have identified themselves as a

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,870
helper will help you out for ignore you

00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:49,820
or whatever they're going to do so what

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:52,790
I'm going to do now it's on my user

00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:55,550
interface for this see it like a Sierra

00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:59,690
quest coming down don't have any other

00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:02,800
pause happened in your duel I think

00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,800
there's a couple at the conference

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,740
no no no this is this is the people have

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,740
asked me powers too well

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:48,080
declaring this list funko hey very nice

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:48,080
of it no it's a list of pumpkin doesn't

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:14,010
okay i'm going to start improving things

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:18,630
here this is going to take a minute free

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,739
time because we actually have these

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,030
little links to check to see if there's

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,030
anything close to what you're asking for

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:33,599
after you've done this the next thing

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,949
we're going to do is prepare the module

00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:36,300
rough with the cpn it's not give me

00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:37,650
anything fancy it's just going to be a

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,509
module doesn't even have to have kogan

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,580
it we just want you to be able to upload

00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:44,330
a file it'll seep in so the way you

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,740
might want to start doing this is with a

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,810
something called module starter which is

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,789
the pro module module double pong

00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,240
starter I have a whiteboard I should use

00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:55,740
it i will show you this process but if

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,110
you're a headache serve wait for me to

00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:02,849
do something you might want to start in

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:04,530
this vid this ball is in the direction

00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:07,530
that you see the documentation for that

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,580
model and create the distribution again

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,909
it doesn't have to actually do anything

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:15,120
i would suggest if you call this module

00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:21,570
click attack me and then the name you

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:23,220
chose for your appalling acne Jesus name

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,840
is basically using Perl or goofing

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:31,259
around in eggs aren't entirely serious

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,509
okay so there is some name FL if you

00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:38,159
make a sound a tiny a new program

00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:40,580
reduces poverty so again you have the

00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,580
public

00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:57,020
let me do it much easier once Wow a lot

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,370
of people wanting positive now you don't

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,860
have to actually do anything with this

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,270
there's no requirement that you use it

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,110
once a year or something like that it

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:09,860
doesn't expire and of those ninety five

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:16,370
hundred or so people everything that we

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:18,050
claim their cpa opens a relatively small

00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:22,970
fraction that very active in a

00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:42,770
particular month whoa well here we have

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:46,550
it at one point you always it we talked

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:51,380
about doing a command-line interface for

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:52,909
this this is the sort of SP God normally

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,919
I just do this with the email that i get

00:06:52,909 --> 00:07:00,500

when I ever i approve this all right

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:11,050

pradesh mm ave at module Cohen Cohen

00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,280
starter and only thing already dozen

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,320

00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,130
I just get it up to and suddenly find me

00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,170
later or one of the people you know

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:33,550
whereas if an author they might be happy

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:42,830
to help you howwww let us move on life

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:46,820
now let's make some money so this is not

00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:49,490
really a class about downloading hmc pan

00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,260
or interacting with module that sort of

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,460
stuff if you have any question one of

00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,470
the people who have volunteered to help

00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,690
can help you along but most of this is

00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,610
sort of just follow the instruction and

00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:03,320
I'm going to do the same thing about

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:05,540
that on the slide so we can install come

00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,310
on let me eat module starter now you

00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:11,270
don't have to use this I mean it I'll

00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:12,560
show you an offering way to do this but

00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,120
this will give you a leg up you actually

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,060
start to do something Chloe's going to

00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,760
use your seat pan command on I have to

00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,860
put the version on the end of mine yours

00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,600
flights at CNN you're using Sipan minus

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,280
or something called edge doesn't matter

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,020
I'm get it all started this thing I

00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,910
think you could even just download this

00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:34,790
CD and install it bangladeshi one this

00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:36,590
point ok this is what a simple law in

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:40,460
the now tribe Modric very little good

00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:42,260
directory my golden starting friday the

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,450
liquid still isn't thing we didn't even

00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,220
do something simple like just use cash

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,530
to help if I can be simpler because it

00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:52,610
required model and you don't agree their

00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:54,020
own bottle is one you scroll 0 force you

00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:59,360
to do all the stuff that Jim just

00:16:54,020 --> 00:17:01,970
talking about who I just saw this is

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,720
about wiser you can see we uploaded is

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:07,689
broken local Dakota what happens easy

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,539
name set up a skeleton rectory

00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:12,459
structure for you and you just mention

00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:15,759
that in addition to module starter

00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:18,250
there's another cen distribution that

00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,379
does the same thing called exitos module

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,149
maker that was created by definitely and

00:17:20,379 --> 00:17:26,049
then he gets tough to me side the

00:17:22,149 --> 00:17:28,899
maintainer that's up a lot of it nutmeg

00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:32,830
question yeah I'm on a finger one is

00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:34,990
having huge net material to that's no so

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,639
there's a separation to this I don't

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:40,450
care how you make this distribution you

00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:43,120
guys need to make it so let's if I have

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:55,529
module shorter I gotta find where I put

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:59,769
it okay let's see if I can just say this

00:17:55,529 --> 00:18:03,429
module let me say acne I'm just going to

00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:08,620
go off the side of a meeting point ok so

00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:13,080
it creates the same for me give me a

00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:15,549
bunch of output okay I guess that's fine

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,610
biscuit I hope you know you care about

00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:22,120
me though don't you have a directory now

00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:28,210
called acne I think meeting boy if I

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:31,090
change into that yes and so there is my

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:35,980
module bring the left side of your

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:38,889
screen theme I think this has the font

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:41,919
size just add your screen a little bit

00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:46,840
movement the right day I had seen oh ok

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:49,450
I see I got intended usually this whole

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,460
bar yeah I think part of it was just

00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,830
then you discreet other innovative right

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,799
ancestor go which way to the right you

00:18:53,830 --> 00:19:04,419
were right for this quarter yeah okay

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:11,350
great that makes do where you look quite

00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:13,899
an easy dolls okay so is anyone having

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:16,110
problems to this point get over the

00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:19,539
arguments for module starter so I did

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:22,049
know your whole before where is a module

00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:22,049
starter

00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:27,349
well I think if you wanted without a

00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:31,759
argument will tell you it'll get eprice

00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:38,349
all your compu you just a module you

00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:38,349
give something I said acne dee dee Moore

00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:50,059
is it typical to use your email your

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:51,080
cpap okay okay so listen up off you for

00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:53,629
some other names include your email

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,950
reason you didn't see online i forget i

00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:57,139
headed for you configure in a

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,820
configuration file okay the email that

00:19:57,139 --> 00:20:00,470
you use it's going to put into the

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,049
documentation for the module so if you

00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,940
don't cough your whatever email you want

00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:07,039
to protect in there don't use it with

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,599
finals harder because we're about to

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,059
upload this to see you can which now me

00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:12,259
it's going to upload the pause which

00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:15,289
means it'll make it the seat pan which

00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:19,519
mean google will see it which means it

00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:23,570
will be out there it's there forever yes

00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:25,549
okay so if you're inside your module now

00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:28,210
some of you might have built this in

00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:31,720
other ways that's fine this one has a

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:37,580
built up heel in so how I do that is I

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:42,399
red pearl on the build-up kill ok then I

00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:48,139
read I'm just gonna rebuild yes it is

00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:49,999
yes letters going to build this so just

00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:52,639
run it you don't have to know what it's

00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:57,080
doing it does not matter what's going as

00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:59,450
long as you get it in this file for that

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:03,379
def Bible your vital that looks like

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:07,489
that similar do not need your module

00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:09,470
Maggie ed boy your cause will accept it

00:21:07,489 --> 00:21:11,090
it won't be indexed but hopefully work

00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,679
they might want to show you questions

00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:16,399
could you show books last two commands

00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:18,919
hood yes I did the last man I did but

00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:25,539
okay personally I did was this the next

00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:25,539
one I did was build this

00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:31,659
you don't have abilify oh you can do 40

00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:34,450
my file and make ya didn't make all that

00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:36,159
you'll do pearl they piled up in a disk

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:41,099
is that normal that module started

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,099
fulfilled my mom even kind of said

00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,690
you're sure as you can not work others

00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:36,070
might not be set up yet I don't know how

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:40,719
that happens at my bats like every hour

00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:43,570
of the day goes on your eyes out so if

00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:45,249
you have to run the makefile um then

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,879
what have to do that using namespace

00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:52,950
he's a bit of work do we do on the

00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:58,419
models are dead kappa lips you do pearl

00:22:52,950 --> 00:23:02,049
make while started with PL the next

00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:06,759
thing is just made it right just I'm

00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:08,679
just gonna die okay I'm there so now

00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:13,709
after that you can have something that

00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:17,169
looks like you're modeling mortgage easy

00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:18,219
if you're on Windows Amaya becomes it or

00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:19,749
if you guys don't think you're figured

00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:22,450
otherwise interview I having slightly

00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:26,379
I'm ready compression system on or

00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:29,529
invited said punch TTT so if you're dope

00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:33,389
that horrible let's go back to our web

00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:36,809
browser login to your paws account

00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:36,809
where's my book

00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:49,320
neologism so if you mind estimates so

00:23:53,999 --> 00:24:04,299
now Oh see if there are bunch of

00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:06,399
different ways and begin upload a file

00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:09,639
to pause the easiest thing for you to do

00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:12,570
right now is to go to this thing upload

00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:15,070
a 12 you pause or public policy pan

00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:18,070
let's under your user menu that shows up

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:35,049
once you login Kristen so if you click

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:40,989
on that you're going to get these

00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:43,779
various forms we can you would HTTP

00:24:40,989 --> 00:24:45,489
upload at the base and we now there's

00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:47,379
also a way to the URL where this thing

00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:49,629
was is for modules how do you keep this

00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:51,639
cases but let's ditch work you say get

00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:55,059
this directory from github or something

00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:56,080
like that I'm or you can use ftp we're

00:24:55,059 --> 00:25:00,369
not going to though we're just going to

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,349
go get where do I owe this thing is I

00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:04,299
don't want me to show the boneyard he'll

00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:07,809
play is a little bit cheerier and yeah

00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:11,830
now it is quite a bit i am I know and

00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:15,429
then oh there's a juice oil thing where

00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:19,239
do I get the desktop feelin a upload

00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:24,940
that thing that you just created doesn't

00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:31,479
change horrible it's horrible then you

00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:33,759
should get something like this oh well

00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:35,950
successfully taught me to think what's

00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,289
happening is that you don't want to

00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:41,830
pause it just takes a while to give it

00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:43,419
that does not mean it accepts it yet one

00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:45,789
of the things that has to do is be a

00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:48,970
unique name that name could never have

00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:50,480
been seen by pause before what someone

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,090
upload they well the particular day

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,490
that's it and if my name maybe the whole

00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:59,390
thing the hackney BTW boy the version

00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:01,160
over there in the target of TC it does

00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,950
not care who it came from here so i can

00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,570
upload a lunch appt days it look like

00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,970
some distributions and somebody else's

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:12,830
paul says losing handle this but right

00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:16,610
away it just takes no I'll get a tiny

00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:19,400
terrific thanks lady that's nice oh um

00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:24,620
so is it take a little while for

00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:29,120
positive get that into space it's a lot

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:32,440
of people doing this great oh look at

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,179
this so brittle is here mario has

00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,010
uploaded multiple FPC van authors

00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:40,190
Brazilian which is just a list of

00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:43,130
Brazilian pause IDs if you are Brazilian

00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:46,280
and you haven't talked to him yet t get

00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:48,679
your name now in that model but you see

00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,350
at the end was made and shows all the

00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:56,030
things have been uploaded there's a name

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:59,450
Arizona file size and there is the

00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:01,280
author than that belongs to now this one

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,570
here's what I'm is not posted now

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:06,669
there's a dress doesn't have an all the

00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:09,830
next book yet by exam to do this dfm I

00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:11,360
do that once again this no wonder we

00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:14,419
loaded instead of once again one of

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,520
those deeper step see if it hasn't

00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:19,160
helped yeah so now it's had time to do

00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,230
as little batch processing problems I

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,860
don't blow off the fires off little kids

00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:28,250
and I have dreamed it is strange so

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:34,700
whoever EV it is that some sort of joke

00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:36,470
about Roman method by the plane just we

00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,679
just the reverse the evening for the

00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:41,780
table um ready so looks like a lot of

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:45,650
people have had no problem uploading

00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:48,490
their first module to see p.m.

00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,490
congratulations

00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:57,070
that's all it is that's it so we're done

00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:59,190
see if dad's all if you take away ball

00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:03,850
roll stuff all the programming stuff

00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:06,190
that's what it is now now we're going to

00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:29,200
add some fun so let's go back to our

00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:30,850
module good find these windows now now

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,809
we get our model directory you know I'm

00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:39,100
going to do just so we on the same page

00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:41,789
here i think i'm going to start over I'm

00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,789
your sort of you

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,740
hey Brian does I might have missed

00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:56,940
something so we started with our module

00:28:52,740 --> 00:29:03,570
sorry did you go over what needs to be

00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:15,870
done to edit the lid file well I want

00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:35,580
this acne boy mm mm n which one because

00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:39,540
i still even oh wait retardo I use my

00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:46,980
microphone I mean look like a filter so

00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:50,940
yeah it is macho starter ok now I am Oh

00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:54,240
animal I don't go to build up hill I

00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,100
guess it does the compatibility it's

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,780
probably reading the config file of your

00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,120
home directory so you can get it also

00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,559
add an Alitalia ok don't worry about

00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,990
that it might see it up a few extra I

00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:07,740
don't want to change my configuration

00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:16,230
right now let's see if I can do this

00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:19,860
pearl make boiled up snow then we make

00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:30,270
this fantastic ok so now I want to do

00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:34,080
this do make test I thought the pots

00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:36,390
average broke automatically on module

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,240
started like the pod coverage breaks

00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:43,559
because in a document OS is a

00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:47,280
documentation of our boiler plate I

00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:52,040
think it was boiler as you give you know

00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:53,940
you like I've covered every installed I

00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,550
think you can actually cover because

00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,160
this tub has caused i think the t

00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:03,300
boilerplate t was to say hey you have

00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,890
enough they did this stuff yeah ok so

00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,280
we've taught is saying is that it

00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:10,169
suffice me i'm always has passed because

00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,970
modules hard earn it boilerplate teams

00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:13,559
test is actually looking for things you

00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,870
haven't updated in a template that

00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:17,190
provided for you he wants you to go

00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:25,770
through and you have to fill in your

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:32,250
code why don't we look at that it's a to

00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:35,840
do so it failed expectedly you don't you

00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:39,000
should say that build effective okay

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,350
what can i do so then one had a chance

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,860
to run out and see that almost has

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:45,840
passed okay so what we've done so far is

00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:49,260
we've uploaded it onto the cpn is where

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,990
all the tests casts Audrey what is going

00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:53,040
to happen now is that the CPM testers

00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,919
are going to recognize that you've

00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:59,160
uploaded a module the CPM and this group

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,620
of a couple I don't know how many people

00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:04,679
aren't seen as it like a 100 or so more

00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:06,450
you don't know are going to download

00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:08,190
this module two test it on there versus

00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,870
a pearl in their machine and a lot of

00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:12,059
these people have virtual machines set

00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:14,880
up for all sorts of things so you're

00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:20,760
going to get tests on all without the 56

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:22,380
on like solaris 2.5 or a test on VMS or

00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,330
something like that pump their own doing

00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,160
this for free we have this distributed

00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:28,140
quality control team that will run your

00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,240
stuff on all their different cells which

00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,010
means you don't have to do this yourself

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,540
you prepare the distribution that you

00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:37,679
want to have tested you uploaded and it

00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,540
happens now it's going to take a while

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,169
to let me get back to you what if this

00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:44,269
response

00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:44,269
an investor so we won't have our browser

00:32:50,149 --> 00:33:03,450
has changed the young they can change

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:18,480
the door obesity because there's some

00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:24,960
problem nope this is the one that it

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:26,669
broke it down so there's a CPS message

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,600
that are doing all this wind up and then

00:33:26,669 --> 00:33:34,369
let's look at a module that's hello

00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,369
sniffles in forever tax dolphin is

00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:39,720
looking fit 10 tap one of these kept

00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:45,899
course or death as you can get all over

00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:47,970
the place so you get this nice matrix

00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:52,289
now across the top is that slight

00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:54,299
leasehold there is a bunch of different

00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:55,830
operating systems so windows but under

00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:58,470
cygwin and then whatever these other

00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,480
ones are and inverse is a pearl and it's

00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,850
showing some colors based on the

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,389
aggregate feeling for that particular

00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:07,919
module seed manchester's is getting

00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:11,879
hundreds of thousands if not millions of

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:15,240
these reports each month this will look

00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:17,909
like everything passes so here we can

00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:20,760
see how you look a person about just

00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:24,119
make up teammate tips there are all

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,859
these motors on something well show you

00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,839
all sorts of things here there's 400

00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:31,889
anyone test muslim most of these things

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:34,859
are failure this version I don't know

00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:36,929
what that anyway that is what's

00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:38,220
happening to your module right now now

00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:40,470
you might not see these results for a

00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,970
couple days as the told Jane catches up

00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:45,119
with you but this is the sort of thing

00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:46,859
you're getting of a cpa offers okay

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,309
let's so what we're going to do this

00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:52,349
will happen to our terminal and we're

00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:54,030
going to do something so that it and

00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:57,540
anyway you like

00:34:54,030 --> 00:35:04,820
the file with acne and whatever your

00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:06,930
unit in there and all I want you to do

00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:09,530
and you can do something else is this

00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:11,580
come down and remove that so my goal

00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:18,930
where does he make the bug that doesn't

00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:24,000
compile so i will save that i'll go back

00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:31,350
i'll make my test in oops they test now

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:32,700
my tests do not pass oh I should have

00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:35,400
mentioned I want you to make one other

00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:38,460
change go down here the same it says our

00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,900
version it just change that be something

00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,960
that's greater than the version can see

00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:48,210
there so I'm just going to turn that one

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:50,490
to me to not only to spas require that

00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:53,400
you upload a unique file name but when

00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:55,530
it wants to add another version of your

00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,570
module you have to increase the version

00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:59,970
number I just make it different but it

00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:02,310
actually has to increase so what we're

00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,870
going to do is just make that happen if

00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:06,720
you don't you'll get back some indexing

00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:09,870
tell your give you an email saying the

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,760
verse numbers are the same and so just

00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:13,410
going to leave it alone what we want to

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,530
do is mention we have our stuff show up

00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:20,040
the various you can search site hey

00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:22,860
that's let's district I wonder if this

00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:27,300
is already happened let's go to betta SI

00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:32,070
tengo org this event is the universe

00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:33,720
shiny cpn search interface and I think

00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,750
it actually looks again a pod incoming

00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,820
directory to grab information about

00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:40,590
model before it's technically available

00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:44,490
for the rest of the world this is the

00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:47,400
length updated maintain its first port

00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:51,930
by bhajan a little yeah it shows up it's

00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:54,690
just it not yet oh it's so it's there if

00:36:51,930 --> 00:37:00,600
you wanted here episode if you click

00:36:54,690 --> 00:37:04,290
back oh we go back ok click on one of

00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:09,530
your other modules ok and then rename it

00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:09,530
up on the URL told ya gotcha

00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:17,010
so have good dab it is so how do you do

00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,510
it how do you do a previous version you

00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,849
have to actually specify the previous

00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:23,970
Irving will figure it out does not work

00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:26,400
at this point right now but that by the

00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:28,339
end of the day sir module should show up

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,260
on one of these pontiff answers or

00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:33,270
medicine man you will have an author ID

00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:37,109
that is there you can see various things

00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:39,930
about yourself either SP for getting

00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:50,220
caught up with this next bit i also want

00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:54,680
to show you free here's my picture ah if

00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:58,339
you set a gravatar so gr a I'm going to

00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:04,830
let the writing so I think it's GA are

00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:06,990
gr8 b8 m8 are commenting you can

00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:10,800
associate a little picture with your

00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:12,750
email address in the search sites they

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,790
will look for a picture associated with

00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:22,710
your CP an email address and put it next

00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:25,980
to your stop by quick the idea be on we

00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:27,690
would thought would be a member that's

00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,330
right but then it's always is it yeah

00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:37,800
yeah yeah all right it's like a garlic

accept donations I'm not rivet there's a

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,820
lot of it you can fill and rocker people

00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:43,710
can know things about you if you're the

00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,750
sergeant ever wants to have a different

00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:48,140
job than what you have now these are

00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:50,670
building your online professional

00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:52,800
profile your brand as they would call it

00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,720
is a fancy marketing books that's part

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,530
of this is the fact that you had it for

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,910
a while you don't want to have some job

00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,350
interview they look at your stuff and

00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:04,370
they say oh you've been acting since

00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:07,230
last month that is not an impressive

00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:08,340
president always been acted for years so

00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:15,720
even if you don't plan on having

00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:18,210
something now turpin this up okay so as

00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,400
I'm on broke in their home yes probably

00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:22,260
the easiest thing you've done this would

00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,450
be the one instance in a class where

00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:28,320
people would get along by making our

00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:33,270
code working okay so now what you do is

00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:36,510
is due to make this again well before

00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:38,220
you do that do make this test this is a

00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:40,160
name that will take everything is going

00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:42,870
to do to make your distribution do that

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,660
change into that directory run the test

00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:47,220
again to make sure you've got all the

00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,710
pits in place they might have left out a

00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:51,270
file meet again we're not explaining

00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:55,050
with CGI mechanic so what's actually the

00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:56,400
distribution boat so I am I used to have

00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:58,440
this problem quite a bit so I forget to

00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:04,200
put a file in manifest or something to

00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:08,040
that should also feel now it does but

00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:10,370
what I want you to do is doing me just

00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,370
again

00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:36,869
might have to glue a neat on the way

00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:36,869
that 00 itunes

00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:58,940
what you should have now in your

00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:02,090
directory is another car ball with your

00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:04,220
new version number pub load that is

00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:06,620
broken I want you to upload it I'm get

00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:07,880
my ogres keeping our soap okay have you

00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,670
gave your all for his number for some

00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,220
reason there's a way you can start over

00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:15,440
and that's what I had to do Sadie do a

00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:17,090
make clean I don't actually know the

00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,240
problem that let us know that this makes

00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:22,760
Plitt as an addict it's up with that

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,280
build or make I mean if you're if you

00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,820
have a pound uphill he's made whatever

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,410
command you're using before okay and

00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:36,370
then she starts over and into the pearl

00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:36,370
whatever again pearl they filed uphill

00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:50,740
okay so upload that so make this doesn't

00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:53,290
run a big test part no make this test

00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,270
wool well I guess you can configure to

00:42:53,290 --> 00:43:00,850
do that but no make this will just make

00:42:55,270 --> 00:43:02,770
the disk yeah if it ran a test before

00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:04,660
life would be so much easier if you'd

00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:13,420
never get to make the distance like the

00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:15,910
sea panic ok so this up we'll head again

00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,710
now you're not going to see Paula

00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:20,650
complain about that pause does not care

00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:28,960
if your tests pass it will gladly put

00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:35,920
your stuff on CTN ok now what we're

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:39,010
going to do is anyone still ok so now

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:43,990
we're going to do in our directory let's

00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:46,330
go to the end of that bottle again me

00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:52,000
just need that problem that you create

00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:56,370
it alone Oh what it is they're going to

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,380
update the documentation to here we go

00:43:56,370 --> 00:44:01,510
notice that when I was talking about the

00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,860
boilerplate stuff and then description

00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,690
of the names of the great new acne

00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:06,760
Phoebe point that one of the things the

00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:12,280
boiler plate looks for especially to

00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:14,080
change ok so I'm going to take that

00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,320
version I'm birkin right after the 02

00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:19,240
i'm going to say hundreds 401 the

00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:21,910
underscore is a thing that marks this as

00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,950
a development release it is not for get

00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:26,200
users it's for you to upload the seed

00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:27,880
man for other people to trying but it's

00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,620
not going to show up in the CPM indices

00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,780
it's up going to show up as the thing

00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:33,490
that the c-band client download and

00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:36,760
hopefully it doesn't show up at the bank

00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:38,770
people actually start using as you know

00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,500
as I said that one jump on these things

00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:43,090
they see fan the sea pen testers start

00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,590
grabbing it they will grab the

00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:47,370
development version so this is the way

00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:49,540
they can say hey I had a problem on

00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:51,310
linux or debian or something i'm going

00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:54,020
to try this throw it up there see if i

00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:56,930
still have the problem if i do

00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:58,340
it's not going to disturb anyone but if

00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:00,950
you don't have the problems eh maybe I

00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:07,490
can help promote this to our release but

00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:17,420
all what you do now is make that dish

00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:20,420
again pop why is it you gotta read your

00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:23,090
profile yeah why do they have to do that

00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:28,610
you just go I know Holly wait how do I

00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:32,690
know what I did you make ain't it oh no

00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:36,470
I hope okay right I'm not goes up to

00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:42,470
figure that perhaps they documented at

00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:44,450
the pod version change I don't know tell

00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:47,930
me you by Evans if you say pearl they

00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:49,760
file that hill oh yeah that's right so

00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:52,970
you might want to do this just make this

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:56,030
command my big clean a semicolon pearl

00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:57,860
mate wild up there's nothing stupid

00:45:56,030 --> 00:46:12,830
going on here but I'm not going to stop

00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:19,490
to figure it out extend yeah 400 make

00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:21,500
the main player moves you'll intro this

00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:24,050
is a danger of doing live demonstrations

00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:27,770
yes it is true you have to change the

00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:29,660
pie version as opposed to the our dollar

00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:34,550
version almost that's the one that I'll

00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:40,190
sat on about Dawn's you're just I think

00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:42,410
my father did no change did you might

00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:45,140
see that because if you try to do it as

00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:47,360
the change may be a ton of oil do my

00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,980
blog awright maybe i just had to detach

00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,420
do it twice like it's at once then

00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:54,830
change the 5 version and I did it again

00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:58,970
it works so okay maybe the maybe just

00:46:54,830 --> 00:47:01,760
need to do to the timestamp anyway so I

00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:05,330
know how this thing it is still broken

00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,510
but it's a developer version so upload

00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:07,510
that

00:47:08,479 --> 00:47:14,910
now what I expect to happen when you

00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,009
look at your seat pan page later or

00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:23,099
tomorrow that you'll see then they have

00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:26,729
01 02 and maybe you won't see dot zero

00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:28,019
to underscore 01 wouldn't be there what

00:47:26,729 --> 00:47:29,249
users won't see it because it's not

00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:31,440
something that users are expecting to

00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:38,809
see it should still show up in the seat

00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:38,809
man testers stop you can look at that

00:47:38,900 --> 00:49:04,519
okay let's finish up how to make do oh

00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:04,519
my

00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:22,420
it's going to get off the router say

00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:24,920
that terms of it is but certainly easier

00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:51,130
it was over to our chocolates you had

00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:54,790
the board let's talk of yeah I'm fine

00:49:51,130 --> 00:50:22,850
you know too much about this anymore

00:49:54,790 --> 00:50:25,190
yeah it was should process oh yeah yep

00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:27,980
we haven't added anything I look at

00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:30,920
examples of total i'm going to create

00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:40,760
another test pal yes okay all right and

00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:43,610
it fortunately I don't have in our

00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:46,220
forces so see ya I love the place will

00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:50,120
learn about sometimes works my chart

00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:53,750
down there what other your judgment each

00:50:50,120 --> 00:51:04,870
other's eyes focus look like you have

00:50:53,750 --> 00:51:04,870
different slideshow oh shoot

00:51:32,869 --> 00:52:37,050
yes what's the deal with ginger files

00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:38,760
and eel I made a little scare there so i

00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:41,040
think it's just say just want to show

00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,570
you men get a time an automatic with

00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,430
eggs to file with the fact that you

00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:46,740
upload I think it also physically it up

00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:49,560
and just say announcing her pretty more

00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:52,200
alive so if you look at the web form i

00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:55,530
think it comes behind or something in

00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:57,210
quiet on the miles there's a technical

00:52:55,530 --> 00:53:00,180
than them and then write later the other

00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:02,010
ones and they have none yeah young from

00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:05,520
ya if you get out as ever in hospital ID

00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:13,670
yeah did you get this airport yeah

00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:25,609

this is the mostest and you can do this

00:53:33,859 --> 00:54:10,759

00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:10,759

00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:17,160
are basically go to trial versions upon

00:55:13,829 --> 00:55:21,019
the only route to write elapsed we're

00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:21,019
getting word in common

00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:32,970
right here right right right so there's

00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:37,240
the example on the Nordica my face right

00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:40,960
the past two years because you will see

00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:47,980
in credits from my school using the

00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:53,230
difference a dip 0.2 0.1 and so apart

00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:55,660
did someone got particularly there are

00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:59,830
some really significant differences and

00:55:55,660 --> 00:56:03,130
we are either so and you oughta turn

00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:06,670
around I mention Christmas matter

00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:13,540
educational programs targeted sujet du

00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:20,200
equals shining at Avery my husband ni to

00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:22,750
our neighbors worse under my feet

00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:26,140
they're so what you do is where I

00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:43,350
started quite to focus all over and then

00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:46,090
I had like a later now say they are dark

00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:51,220
they are accessible by going to descend

00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:55,140
ago and it didn't work out not spot this

00:56:51,220 --> 00:57:00,180
agent Leisel dead my daughter's

00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:00,180
exploiting is a server relationship

00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:22,450
search to go to church dance music long

00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:24,870
ways well if you have already commented

00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,870
on

00:57:27,289 --> 00:57:36,809
yeah yeah hundred that we were wondering

00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:40,740
that you said is so that it's all the

00:57:36,809 --> 00:57:43,380
and of course the w manure all over the

00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:45,660
road is like Kaitlyn basically goes to

00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:48,359
an arbitrary person uses their beer on

00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:50,339
okay oh you only every time you look at

00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:52,079
the ball that is there are companies New

00:57:50,339 --> 00:57:54,569
York and I very short and this is the

00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,609
course companion which is years ago you

00:57:54,569 --> 00:58:01,440
know the connections were take us why we

00:57:56,609 --> 00:58:06,420
have so so answer that's a good thing

00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:08,849
government seems live I'm tired I know

00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:15,859
you don't I'd remember that donor is

00:58:08,849 --> 00:58:19,529
broken for custom way to if you can use

00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:29,430
the other to every there may be some itt

00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:32,999
variety so so that's the there others

00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:35,430
all you can do series of the things here

00:58:32,999 --> 00:58:38,609
like would say you were at some point

00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:40,230
well i would say i took a little

00:58:38,609 --> 00:58:45,089
minister matter what areas are the

00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:47,220
original author get maybe anchor go into

00:58:45,089 --> 00:59:08,940
shipping emissions and change the

00:58:47,220 --> 00:59:11,670
mission so that I from your city I can't

00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:14,099
be I hope you know they're both young

00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:17,369
and the restless that's new to the chi

00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:25,499
barrier switch that is there even wanna

00:59:17,369 --> 00:59:27,799
become canonical since a mess I to make

00:59:25,499 --> 00:59:27,799
soda

00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:42,660
okay so we did that and then here are

00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:50,910
coming up there with others nope I dress

00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:54,539
atone save hunt so our rule 65 it was

00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:57,000
just a demonstration so I think you know

00:59:54,539 --> 01:00:02,839
the other years and then attacked

00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,839
commentary bug you are stupid so I said

01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:16,529
most abused complete sequences put up

01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:19,680
dark and then kinds of people let's get

01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:22,559
started again we're going to show you a

01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:25,250
few other things and then we only have a

01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:28,170
little bit more plan anyway you just

01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:31,349
take questions from you or try

01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:35,069
everything if you like to do so so far

01:00:31,349 --> 01:00:37,109
you've uploaded it one that passes one

01:00:35,069 --> 01:00:38,670
that fails but as a user version number

01:00:37,109 --> 01:00:40,710
one the building has a developer version

01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:42,390
number and something effects of that

01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:44,750
you're not going to see until the other

01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:46,559
bits of the toolchain get a hold of it

01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:49,640
one of the things that we're also not

01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:52,859
going to get to play with right now is

01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:56,760
the request tracker every cement author

01:00:52,859 --> 01:01:09,210
automatically gets an account at RT got

01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:10,829
C&O org RT dot C pandaboard or e so this

01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:13,730
is where we can find bugs of all things

01:01:10,829 --> 01:01:15,809
before you actually log in let's just

01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:20,039
the search for the search for

01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:24,839
distributions that it's quite module

01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:27,539
finding tangency all my books there's if

01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:33,779
there's on my modules just look for your

01:01:27,539 --> 01:01:37,110
bug list for saying this guy taxi and so

01:01:33,779 --> 01:01:41,880
there's something I to do with that

01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:45,090
you will get this sort of thing for your

01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:48,600
module automatically just by having an

01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:54,330
account because you have a CID we model

01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:55,830
the bottom back to get a few inside part

01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:57,720
you guys even at work thank you is just

01:01:55,830 --> 01:02:00,180
a section of this set aside for a

01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:02,940
particular namespace this case is half

01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:09,990
CPM so what we could do let's go back to

01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:12,060
the main page moon it began crop report

01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:14,940
a bug just as a normal user and a

01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:18,960
variety of ways let me make this one of

01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:21,450
your team check this out you can just

01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:24,360
say both cash they get your distribution

01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:27,240
date at RGS you can afford to set up

01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,710
meal which will now report bug it

01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:30,750
doesn't have to be for your module it

01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:32,670
can be for anybody's module but it has

01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:35,250
to be the distribution aim I be

01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:36,720
different than the modulating will see

01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:40,770
the distribution and we look at minute

01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:49,980
CPM work Sipan search so I might have a

01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:54,930
bug app cpn well 0 at RTE beyond org

01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:57,030
don't say no it up oh you want to play

01:02:54,930 --> 01:03:02,510
around that let's see what else I head

01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:02,510
up hoping to bring it on we can do is

01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:10,320
listen to this report about certain you

01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:14,330
can do it on this boat deck I think you

01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:14,330
had to sign in to use the GUI interface

01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:27,460
let's do this oh here is a new ticket in

01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:35,090
yeah I can never find it tighter bundle

01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:39,880
mastering parole I'm not going to

01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:39,880

if someone's being a jerk to you for

01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:45,570
some reason there is this interesting

01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,970
article I read the newspaper the other

01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:50,850
day about how the internet is being

01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:52,560
taken over by trolls because every

01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:53,820
comment board is this an excuse in that

01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:56,220
would push whatever political

01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:58,320
positioning out even is a website about

01:05:56,220 --> 01:06:00,660
giddy and they want to talk about yarn

01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:04,260
they will talk about the war in the deal

01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:05,940
or no everything's it doesn't matter

01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,200
people are going to be like I've no

01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:10,200
matter what you feel about it to just

01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:11,580
delete their stupid tickets if it's

01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,340
something when they're reporting an

01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:18,000
issue in their meeting about it in some

01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:19,560
way doesn't matter does it change your

01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,450
life should change your life anyway just

01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:24,660
say thanks for the information I'll look

01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:26,190
into that and they go on have a heavy

01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:29,760
dinner with your family go out see you

01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:32,280
moving don't let the pool waste your

01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:36,390
time yes I could be mistaken but I

01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:40,560
believe in the in the case of of logging

01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:43,200
into rit.edu org Doogie either set up an

01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:46,770
account with our own account with our

01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:49,410
content Oh leave it for more 50-54 if

01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:51,630
you are a secant author you can log in

01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:54,750
with your quads ID okay so there's a

01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:57,150
couple ways to get into it and they have

01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:59,580
suddenly different functionalities

01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:02,070
capabilities but hopefully it doesn't

01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:04,530
make much difference okay what's once it

01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:07,620
says you are logged in your log in and

01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:11,390
you can create a bug report via the

01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:15,090
interface you can also advise earlier

01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:17,850
create a bug report with you know just

01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:21,180
might be just anybody and using the

01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:23,190
gmail okay so you're going to get those

01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:24,990
sort of things on that buggy stuff for

01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:29,670
you tomorrow morning I think that

01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:31,830
happens overnight let's go back to see

01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:36,330
if I can get okay so this is sort of my

01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:37,500
the minus our meeting tonight now when

01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:38,670
you get a ticket it doesn't have any

01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:42,810
particular priorities you can go ahead

01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:45,000
and step on it stuff yourself see over

01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:47,550
here it says new

01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,290
hope it installed so this one I haven't

01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:55,950
responded to get its opening it's

01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:59,040
critical to what they should do is take

01:07:55,950 --> 01:08:04,280
the shows i dealt with this or any

01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:06,690
little thing I'm going to say stalled

01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:10,320
how to fix it after this conference I

01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:13,170
think mark everything up to yes this is

01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:14,400
a note even after appointment they get a

01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:16,890
little bit feedback which will probably

01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:21,029
ignore that said yeah you saw it deal

01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:22,410
with it oh I hate the negatively framed

01:08:21,029 --> 01:08:24,390
like that where this is going to be a

01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:25,470
pain for you it's just you're not going

01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:28,200
to notice all the people who are

01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:30,509
extremely positive and helpful they're

01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:34,200
going to totally really really bad about

01:08:30,509 --> 01:08:36,750
one person who spoil the whole thing you

01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:38,490
put yourself out there as a programmer

01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:40,799
as an artist that's whatever you're

01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:44,069
getting your everyone license to say

01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:46,020
things about me it doesn't matter my

01:08:44,069 --> 01:08:48,600
wife it is an opera singer she does not

01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:49,770
read the reviews you know what none of

01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:53,430
the opera singers that don't beat their

01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:55,680
rooms it doesn't matter you they know

01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:57,240
what they did in this matter you know

01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,950
what you've done you know that this is

01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:00,720
open source you know that this is really

01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:06,480
available to anyone to change it any way

01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:08,100
they like you aren't fiercely okay again

01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:11,220
i'm saying some negative things about

01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:13,259
this I just want you to be prepared with

01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:19,350
a realistic expectation of how this is

01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:21,210
going to go down okay so that's that but

01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:22,680
probably that out once you get so yeah

01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:24,630
any broken module now so you can submit

01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:28,980
your bug again said say hey create this

01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:31,080
or fixes virgin now let's do the next

01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:33,630
thing you want to do again this is not

01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:34,710
the class and making modules so if you

01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:35,880
don't quite understand what's going on

01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:38,100
maybe we can just follow the

01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,060
instructions the end a pro key module so

01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:43,290
what I'm going to do is try to make

01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:44,790
tests before i do anything i do a make

01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:47,910
test either to make sure i made a good

01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:50,730
spot birthday works or that something is

01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:52,109
actually broken if i start changing go

01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:54,810
before you that i might not actually

01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:58,440
know where i started time so we have to

01:09:54,810 --> 01:10:00,239
fix that let's fix that and Mike

01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:05,070
ladies removed a silly bulbs open that

01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:08,040
bag and as i'm doing this i'm just going

01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:13,230
to increase the version number there in

01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:15,600
a dog and in module so I'm just going to

01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:16,949
increase the part that is after the

01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,810
underscore because I don't know if it

01:10:16,949 --> 01:10:20,280
works yet so I'm going to fix it but i'm

01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:21,750
going to give CD and testers a chance to

01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:28,680
look at it before i actually promote it

01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:30,449
to a fixed release so from that bit you

01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:34,530
can go ahead and make the distribution

01:10:30,449 --> 01:10:48,210
again let's see if it works so it cleans

01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:51,719
though and then i can have both that but

01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:53,280
wait if I guess this is a tub in party

01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:55,170
writers you get submit button and

01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:57,900
claiming he bills and both me and

01:10:55,170 --> 01:11:01,790
shortening in that case i'll upload that

01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:04,170
oh wait for you to that make dis test i

01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:05,940
read some of the stuff as a tool to just

01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:09,900
do all this money automatically you can

01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:13,469
always forget the step but now that i

01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:16,770
could manually again so the test path

01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:23,930
might not go back also you don't way to

01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:23,930
do this see my ftp ftp upon the work

01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,920
help

01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:50,000
see their ftp open but not see what they

01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:50,000
do no

01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:11,080
his paws up roll that work whoever said

01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:12,640
that thank you this is machine somewhere

01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:17,400
in Germany Brent by a guy named my

01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,400
greatest pony so log in as anonymous

01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:28,000
send some string there to be a password

01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:29,290
if you look in here you don't have to do

01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,890
it like this as a feel a little hard way

01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:31,890
reviewing days

01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,650
and we're just showing you the very

01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:45,270
basics of all of this if you search for

01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:47,310
how to upload a seat pan you'll find

01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:50,760
about 10,000 different people upgraded

01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:52,619
differently to do this it's like a see

01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,300
you can upload script there I even a

01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:57,060
male model release the tank all dis

01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:59,159
Zilla you just got to pick something

01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:01,940
that fits with how you like to work and

01:12:59,159 --> 01:13:08,639
how you like to deal with your stuff

01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:14,400
come on okay we're going to we want come

01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:22,739
back to that in so now we want to do is

01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:29,639
make a change in our module what's good

01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:32,190
edit this guy so I already open a

01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:37,380
diversion they just did where do we

01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:40,679
upload that yeah we did I'm going to do

01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:41,820
this i cant pretend we're going to fix

01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:50,670
everything i'm going to call it version

01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:55,619
3 0.03 let's just look out further in

01:13:50,670 --> 01:14:01,110
this now here is the code that putting

01:13:55,619 --> 01:14:04,920
it for you automatically this is some

01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:06,119
stuff over there is a documentation and

01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:09,300
then there's a subroutine so there's

01:14:06,119 --> 01:14:12,900
some documentation which has not be as a

01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:20,670
17 so you know I'm going to do this I'm

01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:26,489
going to make this I call some film the

01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:31,320
documentation it turns the sum of

01:14:26,489 --> 01:14:38,179
numbers since I'm doing that I'll come

01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:38,179
here and say expecting list of numbers

01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:43,170
this is actually how I take a program I

01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:44,880
just want it right out documentation

01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:47,940
that's right clarifies my thinking a lot

01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,170
about to do because as I say I'm going

01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,890
to do something that's my weight lad to

01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:52,750
deport wait

01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:55,570
by the timing through that process I'm

01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:57,100
ready to code having to go oh its way to

01:14:55,570 --> 01:15:00,070
let that we now have to back up and

01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:03,970
throw away that going so now I'm going

01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:06,430
to also change the flesh issue this I'm

01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:08,530
going to stop with that I get a little

01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:10,540
bit too excited about this sort of stuff

01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:14,470
so I want to stop in the middle if you

01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:17,110
make test again and look at this I add

01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:18,490
to the documentation for some by change

01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:20,710
the function name and now my ipod

01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:23,890
coverage test build saying I have one

01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:25,510
making supper gene its function one it's

01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:27,070
looking at I have a documentation bit

01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:29,170
for every function that I put in there

01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:31,300
and since I change the name of the

01:15:29,170 --> 01:15:34,330
documentation but not the actual am 17

01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:37,860
they've been playing so let's go back

01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:37,860
and fix that Oh

01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:52,880
okay so what we're going to do is just

01:15:50,179 --> 01:16:03,260
say there's various ways that we can do

01:15:52,880 --> 01:16:05,750
this will just be simple I'll talk with

01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:08,119
my son is 0 this is not the way I

01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:09,739
program is but I don't want to explain

01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:13,730
programming in this pass obviously these

01:16:09,739 --> 01:16:14,960
up in learning profile for each thing in

01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:28,670
F hundred square which is the argument

01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:33,199
list FF to some again return some okay

01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:34,750
now we've done that it's not important

01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:37,099
that particular code you put in there

01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:39,619
we're just I'm just showing you changing

01:16:37,099 --> 01:16:42,710
a thing what we're going to do is write

01:16:39,619 --> 01:16:44,869
a test for that it's not important

01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:48,139
heating what the test does for this

01:16:44,869 --> 01:16:49,489
class it's just that we're going to have

01:16:48,139 --> 01:16:52,550
a test because it's going to be a new

01:16:49,489 --> 01:16:57,829
file in our distribution so we'll say

01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:59,179
make test again great pop make tested

01:16:57,829 --> 01:17:00,949
probably one of the things I hate most

01:16:59,179 --> 01:17:05,119
frequently and all of my programming

01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:07,190
career if i type in MA my finger just

01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:09,289
magically keep going to make test if i

01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:11,300
wanted to make something else I mean I

01:17:09,289 --> 01:17:14,869
think it's only second to like typing

01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:17,869
ce4 change director maybe he'll ups but

01:17:14,869 --> 01:17:20,420
L that's not so much okay that's great

01:17:17,869 --> 01:17:22,969
but what I'm going to do is I want to

01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:26,059
make a new test file I'm gonna call T

01:17:22,969 --> 01:17:32,630
some duck team how am I going to do this

01:17:26,059 --> 01:17:37,969
this is a perl script the huge strict

01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:43,460
use mornings well i'll let other stuff

01:17:37,969 --> 01:17:48,139
go crucify me over bottom row this use

01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:49,730
test for the simplest thing that could

01:17:48,139 --> 01:17:52,519
possibly work right now there is a

01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:55,429
function tests were called pass so I

01:17:52,519 --> 01:17:57,079
don't want to explain testing you might

01:17:55,429 --> 01:18:00,139
already heard this gym to do all that

01:17:57,079 --> 01:18:02,120
stuff here the import be the actual

01:18:00,139 --> 01:18:04,400
tehzeeb it is not important for our

01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:10,310
this is the fact we got a new test file

01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:15,320
in our distribution is okay Plus that

01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:17,360
make test again look at that so some

01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,890
ducks here and it says tests were run

01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:21,890
but don't plan with your player okay

01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:24,230
good i got in here I should have pointed

01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:26,810
it up to force let's do this at the

01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:29,900
bottom here business a done testing you

01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:34,640
need a recent version of test more kind

01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:39,230
of use that if you get it there're still

01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:41,390
with that we will try something else so

01:18:39,230 --> 01:18:46,670
I run big test again now everything

01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:48,880
passes i can upload this to c pn at this

01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:53,290
point i would tell you to upload and CPM

01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:53,290
or did they make yes Oh

01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:16,119
and everything would appear it worse see

01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:18,760
if ingested to get in they go through

01:19:16,119 --> 01:19:20,739
all the stock level it wouldn't get

01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,940
these some tests that we just created

01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:24,190
because it didn't show up in our

01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:25,989
manifest file so it did show up in our

01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:27,340
distribution so we want to be

01:19:25,989 --> 01:19:33,070
distributing all the stuff that we

01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:40,630
needed but so don't upload this version

01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:43,510
just yet okay oops so in our directory

01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:46,330
there's a manifest and this is true part

01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:54,489
we wanted to use build up PL and make

01:19:46,330 --> 01:19:56,739
all up hill we look at that I was just a

01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:59,230
list of file that make disk is one to

01:19:56,739 --> 01:20:00,340
use to create the distribution it

01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:01,600
doesn't care what you put in there

01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:03,400
whatever file is you put in there

01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,139
whatever paths it's going to take

01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,219
putting in the archive that it makes and

01:20:05,139 --> 01:20:13,360
that's the thing that shows the patient

01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:15,550
arbol so those are our team / sub da

01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:19,030
teef I love nothing there now we don't

01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:23,739
have to edit this file ourselves we can

01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:26,889
say made manifest look at this it's ads

01:20:23,739 --> 01:20:32,369
manifest by tarball which is interesting

01:20:26,889 --> 01:20:36,510
I don't want that and it's added this

01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:36,510
let's go find out why it did that bit

01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:48,330
why white men just skip it should have

01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:48,330
been going to our goal would Oh

01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:57,090
okay there's also this file which I

01:20:54,959 --> 01:21:01,439
don't want to get into its you realize

01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:03,659
in the various documentation and I'm

01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:05,669
going during a pearl oh man does not

01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:10,139
skip that they Pat is a list of pearl

01:21:05,669 --> 01:21:15,119
patterns to ignore we've you make panda

01:21:10,139 --> 01:21:19,079
oops so some reason I don't have the

01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:22,860
version except the back up with that so

01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:27,269
if i run this again now it has a pattern

01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:36,840
say ignore the tarball i remove the

01:21:27,269 --> 01:21:42,929
manifest that thing everyone tracking so

01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:44,189
far okay so look at my manifest which

01:21:42,929 --> 01:21:47,610
you normally don't have to do you sort

01:21:44,189 --> 01:21:52,320
of presence there there is my some tea

01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:54,510
ah there is an excellent book on this

01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:56,219
sort of stuff that is going through the

01:21:54,510 --> 01:22:01,820
same for some that we're doing here and

01:21:56,219 --> 01:22:01,820
slightly out of date but it's all riding

01:22:01,939 --> 01:22:12,409
perl modules or seep in I think it's

01:22:09,869 --> 01:22:15,989
something like that it's my Sam trigger

01:22:12,409 --> 01:22:17,550
and it's an impress buck and they used

01:22:15,989 --> 01:22:23,249
to have a free download but I think you

01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:24,659
remove that it's interchanges old or

01:22:23,249 --> 01:22:28,260
something like that but the process had

01:22:24,659 --> 01:22:32,610
to change that much so all this same

01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:35,539
stuff should be in here so I want to

01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:40,889
release it again so hopefully big test

01:22:35,539 --> 01:22:44,969
what okay he always has passed well

01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:48,739
let's go back to Hawaii kinda high and

01:22:44,969 --> 01:22:48,739
the FDB think of the work

01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:09,600
oh ok so now i can upload this and

01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:12,300
there's my thumb of team why don't we

01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:15,840
make this test bachelor show the

01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:17,489
subducting thing works now about those

01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,570
you going to do test I'll go in and do

01:23:17,489 --> 01:23:20,610
all the things that you've probably seen

01:23:18,570 --> 01:23:22,350
other people talk about testing I would

01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:23,460
call this over team with a bunch of

01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:25,290
numbers and see if I get back the

01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:26,820
expected thing I follow subroutine with

01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:29,730
nothing to see what it does with no

01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:32,010
arguments I'll give it jump arguments

01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:33,360
and see how it handles that I want to

01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:36,360
test to see if it gives warnings when I

01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:39,530
try to break it how I can enjoy that and

01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:43,320
so on but that's not with this class

01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:46,230
okay so we got to go dad in you're all

01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:48,120
set that's basically the process the

01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:49,470
rest of it you'll have to discover as

01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:52,830
you go along you're going to interact

01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:55,020
with various other things tomorrow you

01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:57,510
should get to see a page for you in your

01:23:55,020 --> 01:24:00,660
modules on meta see panda or in Sipan

01:23:57,510 --> 01:24:04,320
search you should have your RT account

01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:06,780
that sometime tomorrow you will probably

01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:09,720
get some email from sea pen testers

01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:11,070
saying your module fails and give you

01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:13,050
some information about that hope that's

01:24:11,070 --> 01:24:16,950
what we should do we have seen a message

01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:18,510
preferences don't we the problem

01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:21,120
teaching some of these classes is that I

01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:24,290
noticed once only once ever in my life

01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,290
but forget that it ever existed

01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:41,690
Jim you remember how does it see that

01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:54,810
doesn't preferences I've never done it I

01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:56,100
don't think this is the same login okay

01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:57,600
I don't know where this is maybe i can

01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:59,910
come up this later there is a way you

01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:02,040
can say i want mail or don't want me out

01:24:59,910 --> 01:25:06,330
I want me Oliver only these modules and

01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:11,240
all these other models oh wait yellow w

01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:17,510
yo little crevices somebody reads

01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:19,500
Reading Is Fundamental okay um login

01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:26,250
this is probably using lessee pen

01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:27,750
potential clue yes fantastic okay great

01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:29,700
so there's that preferences link at the

01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:39,120
top that is between the yellow and the

01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:43,620
green bars okay over here default

01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:45,390
filters go ahead and say what was the

01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:48,480
think of any individual reports it said

01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:49,800
all these summaries some reason I don't

01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,690
like so much you might like them

01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:53,730
humphreys it's really hard to get things

01:25:51,690 --> 01:25:57,030
out of your inbox because you don't

01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:59,370
handle all the things in the report you

01:25:57,030 --> 01:26:00,540
can't bring it out of your inbox but

01:25:59,370 --> 01:26:02,850
then when you come back then you don't

01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:05,930
remember which they can handle well it's

01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:08,850
up to you however you like to do it now

01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:12,540
each report here let me make this a

01:26:08,850 --> 01:26:13,890
little bigger each report can have a

01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:15,870
different sort of grade it get past

01:26:13,890 --> 01:26:18,390
which we've all your tests and no

01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:21,030
problem fail something wrong or

01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:22,350
something bad happen here's an NDA yours

01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:23,820
various ways that you can save the test

01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:25,230
up to say this doesn't work on Mac

01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:29,850
because it's a windows thing so don't

01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:32,040
even try not camac the hook and in there

01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:33,660
if they get something where it says

01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:37,200
don't need to test me on the system it

01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:39,320
send you back to na i'm not sure what it

01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:42,270
ended it has it wasn't have something

01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:44,270
but what I get to say yes we tried it

01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:47,090
and I did say na

01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:48,890
I guess that if you see if any testers

01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:50,240
got something in the tested don't try to

01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:53,060
use me because i only work on windows

01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:56,900
for instance you got back in a report on

01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:58,880
that would let you know that people who

01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:00,890
try to install this on a solaris or

01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,260
whatever are going to get the same

01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:06,500
fashion saying i don't work on this so

01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:08,420
don't install me so I isn't an

01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:10,280
indication that did that Kate will

01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:12,770
having a bunch of others up so you might

01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:16,160
want to go and set that stuff I don't

01:27:12,770 --> 01:27:19,220
know if it's already set up for you as

01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:20,570
I'm just write it it works okay

01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:24,710
fantastic so you can save your settings

01:27:20,570 --> 01:27:30,800
there on all sides that they purchased a

01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:32,120
few things too I haven't did if there's

01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,070
something you just want ignore like I

01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:38,650
want to ignore like HT access or

01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:41,920
casually I team I can do that I think

01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:46,580
otherwise it is your overall the vaults

01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:51,220
disabled notification they I don't get

01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:54,220
me a little anyway I want to use is that

01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:54,220
ok

01:27:56,150 --> 01:28:01,010
I think that's all that we can show you

01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:03,800
right now that's the basic process

01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:05,239
that's really how simple it is the rest

01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,830
of the stuff is actually dealing with

01:28:05,239 --> 01:28:08,690
your module dealing with a code in your

01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:11,810
module the different vowels in you can

01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:14,780
put there and you can learn a left in

01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:16,280
the various CD and distribution tutorial

01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:19,310
things that are already out there those

01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:21,409
focus on those bits I guess I should

01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:25,520
someone should make up a tutorial for

01:28:21,409 --> 01:28:37,750
this it just does the boring process

01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:52,400
fits well with any questions yes okay so

01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:54,710
if our module uses other modules there

01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:57,080
there is a built file in our

01:28:54,710 --> 01:29:02,870
distribution if you've done them a call

01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:07,429
at PL one is that we look at that there

01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:12,350
is a prereq p.m. of entry for that and

01:29:07,429 --> 01:29:14,659
said I require these modules to work now

01:29:12,350 --> 01:29:17,659
we're we could probably talk for a whole

01:29:14,659 --> 01:29:20,360
session about this sort of thing this is

01:29:17,659 --> 01:29:23,060
the old school boring bits this just

01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:26,150
says I need these dependencies when AC

01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:27,590
bank plane sees this stuff it goes and

01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:31,969
fetches those dependencies and try some

01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:35,000
solace first the various things happen

01:29:31,969 --> 01:29:36,800
with that the newer stuff have way to

01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,480
break out these dependencies into why

01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,250
you need them you might need a

01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:42,080
dependency just to configure the build

01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:44,179
script for instance people want to have

01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:45,679
a newer version of module build or make

01:29:44,179 --> 01:29:47,270
me or something they want to make sure

01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:49,400
you're using that so that would be a

01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:52,489
configures requires instead of the

01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:57,530
prereq p.m. you might be modules just to

01:29:52,489 --> 01:30:02,030
test so that would be a build requires

01:29:57,530 --> 01:30:05,120
is that right builder bars but for just

01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:07,330
for testing in there people using my to

01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:09,489
build is testing fired I don't know it

01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:11,170
okay

01:30:09,489 --> 01:30:13,780
the documentation for your ex she tells

01:30:11,170 --> 01:30:16,210
Meg Baker or module bill look for

01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:18,429
something that requires Escamilla be

01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:20,019
some key where you list the modules the

01:30:18,429 --> 01:30:23,739
modulus of is just the name space that

01:30:20,019 --> 01:30:26,320
you want and the version such as the fat

01:30:23,739 --> 01:30:28,539
arrow now the wisdom here is to put the

01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:31,389
actual name of the module that you're

01:30:28,539 --> 01:30:33,489
using there I'm not another lie on any

01:30:31,389 --> 01:30:37,749
other particular module to include death

01:30:33,489 --> 01:30:39,610
for instance test simple comes in the

01:30:37,749 --> 01:30:42,130
same distribution has test more but

01:30:39,610 --> 01:30:44,260
there have been cases in C Vann history

01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:45,579
where modules have split off deployment

01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:47,590
own distribution so they can travel

01:30:45,579 --> 01:30:51,099
separate paths if you're depending on

01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:54,940
test more gauze a load test simple in

01:30:51,099 --> 01:30:59,010
that split off that might be bad well

01:30:54,940 --> 01:31:02,590
for instance lwv the live w w / /

01:30:59,010 --> 01:31:05,199
recently split off in version 6 the

01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:08,079
support for https into a separate module

01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:09,639
that way you can install the main WP

01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:12,190
stuff which didn't require any of the

01:31:09,639 --> 01:31:14,710
encryption stuff to handle ssl and get

01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:16,780
that and if you want the ssl you can

01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:18,760
install a separate module for that so if

01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:22,900
you said you dependent on one module

01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:25,179
from the HTTP stuff https stuff the

01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:27,550
secure socket layer stuff and expected

01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:30,219
LD BP to automatically load as a

01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:32,800
prerequisite on that word burn and the

01:31:30,219 --> 01:31:34,599
other way around so in there if you look

01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,460
in the make file or the build-up Caleb

01:31:34,599 --> 01:31:39,369
will see how to do that we'll see where

01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:41,170
to do that and then you just keep doing

01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:42,639
that then you have a drink I'm trying to

01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:59,079
figure out which dependencies you have

01:31:42,639 --> 01:32:01,630
and boilers up if you have class this is

01:31:59,079 --> 01:32:03,639
my new models including you yeah yes so

01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:07,119
you just wait well yes you just put your

01:32:03,639 --> 01:32:09,460
something with and the index goes most

01:32:07,119 --> 01:32:16,829
everything and live and discover puts in

01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:16,829
there any other questions

01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:26,690
you asked me and I tell you the answer

01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:30,620
oh and then almost the case he's going

01:32:26,690 --> 01:32:34,330
to see camp at and the cause that so

01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:41,510
let's just go back to the pause web page

01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:45,650
there is FL pause this coach thinks

01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:48,710
about that included that is they taking

01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:52,450
over and there it is the subtly written

01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:54,800
to take over in bandar namespace now

01:32:52,450 --> 01:32:56,510
what we've done has posited minute

01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:59,030
raters you have a capability just

01:32:56,510 --> 01:33:01,100
randomly flip this stuff around this is

01:32:59,030 --> 01:33:03,050
decided collectively just like envision

01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:05,990
that we want to respect people's

01:33:03,050 --> 01:33:09,740
intellectual property we don't want at

01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:11,240
the poor turn port it is open source so

01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:12,260
we don't want to be hasty in just

01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:14,750
someone says I want to take over this

01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:16,670
module because it hasn't had a released

01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:19,790
in two years you want to give the author

01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:22,040
a chance to respond but that might me

01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:23,960
he's on holiday you know he's under some

01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:25,760
pressure at work or whatever it is so we

01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:29,600
don't want to just visit respond in the

01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:31,820
next hour we're passing it on so we go

01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:33,290
through this process with basically i'm

01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:35,270
not going to read you the whole thing we

01:33:33,290 --> 01:33:37,370
ask people to announce publicly in a

01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:40,580
widely read place that i intend to take

01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:42,260
this over just so the community knows

01:33:40,580 --> 01:33:44,450
maybe someone knows what's going on with

01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:46,640
that guy like his email changed or

01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:49,730
whatever and this sort of a cooling-off

01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:51,470
period and if the author doesn't respond

01:33:49,730 --> 01:33:52,880
in a couple of weeks we can make the

01:33:51,470 --> 01:33:55,460
change but that doesn't mean the

01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:58,010
meantime that you have to wait to do any

01:33:55,460 --> 01:34:00,560
work you can put up your version of it

01:33:58,010 --> 01:34:02,720
like a github or wherever and tested you

01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:04,010
even uploaded it if it won't be indexed

01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:06,230
because you don't have the permissions

01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:08,510
that say your version of it should

01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:10,100
appear in the data files but you can

01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:12,170
still have see pen testers looking at it

01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:13,100
and all this other stuff you come to a

01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:16,070
 you've gone through this process

01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:17,720
and you say hey you know it's been three

01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:21,830
weeks or whatever and we usually just

01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:23,990
say okay fine we'll we'll transfer it

01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:25,040
and we send it up to the authors saying

01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:26,690
if you disagree with this because you

01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,310
pop back up you know all this stuff is

01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:31,450
undoable

01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:33,550
we can go back and handle that right

01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:35,830
with you module at Pearl it or I mean

01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:37,150
it's at the instructions as well because

01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:40,390
this is where the paws and is will look

01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:42,190
for this information even if you know

01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:44,830
that manic pause admin and you want this

01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:47,320
done don't write to my private email

01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:50,320
address for this because we are very

01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:52,030
very adamant about carrying out all this

01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:54,520
business in public so people can read

01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:56,440
the email exchange between us unless

01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:58,780
there is something that is very very

01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:01,570
sensitive but you don't want to let on

01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:03,790
like you know we have situations where

01:35:01,570 --> 01:35:08,440
employees disgruntled employees left the

01:35:03,790 --> 01:35:11,460
company and I don't you can imagine the

01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:11,460
sort of situations we might encounter

01:35:12,690 --> 01:35:20,260
any other questions okay in general the

01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:23,860
positive are very glad help with things

01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:26,350
that are related to the process not

01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:27,940
related to what do I do with a code what

01:35:26,350 --> 01:35:33,280
should i do in that sort of thing there

01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:39,150
is another mailing list that you can try

01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:43,600
out that's almost the same song module

01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:44,980
dash authors as people who will

01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:47,650
specifically talk about what I

01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:52,030
specifically generally talk about audio

01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:55,480
development you get advice for them

01:35:52,030 --> 01:35:58,600
little baby advice you know about

01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:59,860
various things I think they might also

01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:04,030
be glad to answer these sort of

01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:08,140
questions on learndutch.org so that did

01:36:04,030 --> 01:36:09,820
a website which is supposed to be

01:36:08,140 --> 01:36:11,230
friendly and have people who are there

01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:12,820
because they want to help people not

01:36:11,230 --> 01:36:16,840
people who are there because they want

01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:18,400
to import their view of the world things

01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:20,530
like stack overflow in 40 months

01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:22,570
generally if you say hey I'm new I

01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:25,630
haven't done this before confusing this

01:36:22,570 --> 01:36:29,110
big help me out I'll try this I tried

01:36:25,630 --> 01:36:32,280
this they are willing to help you might

01:36:29,110 --> 01:36:34,570
even run into me again with that also

01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:36,040
it's only wednesday so you have birthday

01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:37,870
and friday if you want to try to

01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:40,620
accomplish something and actually have

01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:42,810
someone here help you

01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:44,610
it's easier to have someone stand over

01:36:42,810 --> 01:36:48,600
your shoulder and knows what you're

01:36:44,610 --> 01:36:51,240
doing feel free to ask me I can get

01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:52,950
pretty busy during these conferences but

01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:55,800
you know if you want to copy to sculpt

01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:57,570
and interrupt I just you know make sure

01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:00,090
i knows you tell me you have a question

01:36:57,570 --> 01:37:04,830
or I don't kill would be willing to help

01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:07,260
if you see him maybe let me just get one

01:37:04,830 --> 01:37:12,750
thing go module type an author's intro

01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:15,510
that org number one is a moderated list

01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:17,100
so if you have it always subscribe to

01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:21,360
list your pose with the help of

01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:24,060
moderation so see them but more to the

01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:27,240
point is what data dating most people

01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:29,610
use for his I want to clip this code on

01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:32,300
seat pan and I really want other people

01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:35,700
to use it what should I call the

01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:40,350
distribution so that people will so that

01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:44,120
it will be self document and you'll see

01:37:40,350 --> 01:37:46,320
some back and forth you know we're and

01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:50,790
various people whose first educated and

01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:53,340
you don't have to accept it but it can

01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:56,280
be useful because people people might be

01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:58,230
able to say there's a better place for

01:37:56,280 --> 01:38:00,600
you to put in critically at the top

01:37:58,230 --> 01:38:02,820
level and you might have thought of me

01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:06,270
to yourself there's also along with that

01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:08,040
on the third item on the pods public

01:38:06,270 --> 01:38:09,560
venue is all the naming of modules which

01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:13,170
is just all the advice that we sort of

01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:15,810
collected its advice is not they're not

01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:17,220
rules I'm things that we have IP laws

01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:20,700
admin for years and years and years and

01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:23,580
one of my main duties on that is to help

01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:25,140
people choose an appropriate aim I am

01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:26,640
suitable for that because I've been

01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:28,920
around for a while i've been working

01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:31,950
with pause for a while i know a lot of

01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:36,960
models that are already on Sipan as Jim

01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:40,080
said and he's made for me yes huh as Jim

01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:43,410
said people often think they have to put

01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:45,720
their models any particular hierarchy at

01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:48,390
the beginning of Sipan we are trying to

01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:49,680
classify modules so that you know like

01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:51,600
you would have a library where all the

01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:53,740
models adult networking tanks are under

01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:56,620
net all things in web 900 of you

01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:59,850
ww we have moved away from that thing

01:38:56,620 --> 01:39:03,000
has begotten the 25,000 modules or

01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:04,990
25,000 different distributions and

01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,360
110,000 models that we have now that's

01:39:04,990 --> 01:39:09,190
not all that useful especially when

01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:11,530
people are uploading stuff that you're

01:39:09,190 --> 01:39:14,070
just completely in the wrong spot we

01:39:11,530 --> 01:39:16,270
don't have any librarians or actually

01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:19,150
real librarians who are trained and

01:39:16,270 --> 01:39:23,110
classification and sorting working on

01:39:19,150 --> 01:39:26,580
this so there's just a bunch of things

01:39:23,110 --> 01:39:28,600
there as Jim said the main concern is

01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:30,010
making it so that when people see the

01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:32,530
name of your module they know what it's

01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:34,480
going to do for them if you call yours

01:39:32,530 --> 01:39:36,550
like like acne be devoid no one knows

01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:38,740
that's going to do for we're going to

01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:40,990
put all initializations of things be

01:39:38,740 --> 01:39:44,170
marking it up there's some advice there

01:39:40,990 --> 01:39:45,760
so thank you for coming I'm glad this

01:39:44,170 --> 01:39:47,950
turned out well I'm glad we made so many

01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:50,860
new Sipan authors you can go back and

01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:52,060
tell your work that you got all the

01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:55,210
stuff set up make it sound like it was

01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:59,590
really really tough and arduous I think

01:39:55,210 --> 01:40:02,730
that you really spent time working thank

01:39:59,590 --> 01:40:02,730
