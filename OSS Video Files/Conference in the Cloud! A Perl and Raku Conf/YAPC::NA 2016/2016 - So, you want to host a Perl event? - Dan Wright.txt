okay good morning my name is Daniel

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,690
right I see a lot of familiar faces in

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,309
the room so I appreciate that for

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,620
anybody that doesn't know me I'm the

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:17,789
treasurer of the pearl foundation I've

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:21,240
also organized a total of eleven pearl

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:24,529
events so far and including this one

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,320
I've also been involved in a number of

00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:32,430
other pearl conferences as in a support

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,430
role and today the topic is so you want

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,160
to run a pearl event and so I'm hoping

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,700
that there are at least a few of you out

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,940
there that are looking at this event

00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:46,590
going on right now and saying that seems

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,590
like something i'd like to do this seems

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,350
interesting and so my goal is to perhaps

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,910
inspire you to get interested in either

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,910
helping out with the app see or to start

00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:00,690
your own conference somewhere now this

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,899
is a 20 minute talk today back in 2012 I

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,350
gave a much longer talk on on the

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,439
subject of running events and I won't be

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,900
able to get into all the nuances that I

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,760
did that time it might be fun sometime

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,640
in the future to just do like a massive

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,140
brain dump of everything but that won't

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,640
be today today you're just going to get

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,810
the the highlights I'm going to talk

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,130
about some of the things that have

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,420
changed since I last gave this talk and

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,490
I'm going to try to leave some room for

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,590
questions at the end because I think

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,869
that if you're here wanting to learn

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,490
about running an event you probably all

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,960
have questions and I'd like to give you

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,950
an opportunity to ask some of those at

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,470
the end so hopefully hopefully if I did

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,200
a good job you're looking at this event

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,829
and saying hey this looks easy I want to

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:57,869
try this and my response to that is you

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:59,399
should but perhaps before you think

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,630
about starting a gap see it might be a

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,130
good idea to start with something a

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,970
little bit smaller I think it's a great

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,970
idea if you're interested in running

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:14,220
pearl conference to kind of work your

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,740
way up to it so if your goal is

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,510
to have a two-day workshop somewhere

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,100
then maybe start out with a hackathon

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,420
and then build up to a one-day

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,830
conference and then go to a two-day

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:28,350
conference so that you can learn and go

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,480
progressively a lot of times what will

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,720
happen is somebody will start out on a

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,450
really big project and become

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,760
overwhelmed because there's a lot to

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,040
learn it's sort of the iceberg principle

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,020
where you have the the ten percent on

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,570
top that everybody sees and the ninety

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,790
percent under water which is your job in

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:53,700
making a conference happen and so it's

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:57,600
best to approach that gradually the

00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:00,230
biggest mistake that I've seen and I've

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,470
lived through in running a conference is

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,750
not having a solid vision of what your

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,209
conference is going to look like

00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,310
whenever it actually happens and this is

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:14,910
this is so important and it's so easy to

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,890
jump over because again we only see you

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,620
know ten percent of what goes on at a

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,930
conference and we're very excited about

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,440
making an event happen that we don't

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,050
take the time to really think about what

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,330
the look and the feel of the event is

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,700
going to be and and this is so important

00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:35,489
to have a good solid vision from day one

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,650
because if you don't if you don't have a

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,320
good solid vision of what you want your

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,930
conference to be you will be constantly

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,750
reliving that decision-making process

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,330
every step of the way and it'll cost you

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,780
a lot of time and and grief and agony in

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,310
the long run the other thing that can

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,170
cause you a lot of grief and agony in

00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,989
the long run is not having the right

00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,970
team to help you there there is no way

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,160
that one person can run a conference

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,350
maybe maybe if it's a hackathon or

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,680
something very simple you can get away

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:10,080
with a single person job but just the

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,670
you know for example for yap see we've

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,260
got four different rooms running there's

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,900
no way one person could manage four

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,269
different rooms at the same time so it

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,669
takes a lot of people and the more

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,950
people that you have helping you the

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:24,599
less that each person has to do and the

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,950
more likely that when you get to the end

00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:27,510
of the conference everybody's still

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:32,940
going to like each other

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:36,360
so building a team is is important and a

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,550
part of that team for you can be the

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,690
pearl foundation the pearl foundation

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,850
can be a part of your team there are a

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,570
number of things that TPF can help you

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:51,120
with along the way we have a liability

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:54,300
insurance policy carried by the pearl

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,860
foundation it's a 22 million dollars

00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,980
single incident 4 million dollar

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,990
aggregate insurance policy which is what

00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,420
a lot of venues are going to expect from

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,620
you if you're running a conference it

00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,170
doesn't matter if you're on a university

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,550
campus or in a hotel they're going to

00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,380
expect you to have your own insurance

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,660
for in case somebody should happen to

00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,950
get hurt and you'll have to provide that

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,360
proof of insurance and that's something

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:21,690
that TPF can help you with we have a lot

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,350
of equipment that belongs to TPF in

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:28,260
terms of projectors cameras audio

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:37,290
equipment and this is all things that

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:39,870
can be loaned out to you we can do your

00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:42,330
accounting for you if you want if you

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:47,280
want we can accept payments for your

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:52,920
event we can pay out the expenses at the

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:57,120
end and depending on your relationship

00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,890
with TPF we can even go far as go as far

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:04,380
as to extend a certain line of credit

00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:06,480
for example if you are if you need to

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,220
put a deposit down on a venue in order

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,520
to hold it before you've taken any

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:16,770
ticket income in in then TPF can help

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:19,380
you with that as well fundraising is

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:22,500
something that we've been helping out

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,510
with more and more recently it used to

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,200
be if you wanted to run a conference

00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:30,570
then it was your job to go out and get

00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:36,410
your sponsors and set up all those

00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:36,410
relationships with them but

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:43,950
what we found happens is sponsors don't

00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,630
want to have to talk to the organizer

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,950
for this event and then a separate

00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,620
person who's the organizer for that

00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,750
event and a separate person here they

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,790
they prefer to have someone that they

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,950
know that they can talk to for

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:59,060
everything and so what TPF has done is

00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:02,430
transitioned to a model where sponsors

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,230
sponsor TPF directly and then that pot

00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,090
kind of gets shared amongst all the

00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:12,810
conferences and it is working well for

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:14,490
us and of course finally we have a lot

00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,280
of people within the foundation that

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:21,810
have some experience with hosting events

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:25,440
and if you need advice or ideas where

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:28,260
we're happy to be there for you and all

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,440
of these things can be done while it

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:35,550
still remains your event we're not

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:38,460
looking to take over your events and you

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,780
know slap our name on it if you're Pro

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,760
longer group wants to hold a workshop

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,660
that's great we're here to support you

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:48,390
not take over so we're here for you and

00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,340
and we're happy to help and so I would

00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,590
advise anybody that's thinking of

00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,900
putting together a pro event of any sort

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,229
to to reach out to us and see how we can

00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,229
help you

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:09,000
so I wanted to talk very briefly about

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,100
dealing with venues and what I'm talking

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,710
about a venue I'm talking about if

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,870
you're holding it in a hotel if you're

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,300
holding it on a university campus it

00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,730
doesn't really matter where it is unless

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,130
you are small enough that you're getting

00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,930
everything donated to you you're going

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:28,770
to be dealing with with some sort of

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:33,419
event manager at a hotel or or wherever

00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:36,419
and they're going to be bringing up the

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:40,229
dirty word and the dirty word I'm

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:43,200
referring to is standard the first rule

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:46,980
of conference venue standards is that we

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,860
don't talk about standards because there

00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,350
is no standard if if you keep having a

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,050
venue use the word oh we just do it the

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,450
standard way it's this is just standard

00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:01,800
this is how we do it that's a red flag

00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:04,230
because there are no standards the the

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,030
way that venue a does it is going to be

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,950
different from the way venue be does it

00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:11,160
different from the way venue see does it

00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:14,820
do not take anything for granted do not

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,730
assume that it'll just be fine you have

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,500
to actually talk to your venue and get

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:23,100
all the details and don't be afraid to

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,910
ask silly questions don't be afraid to

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,760
ask is it okay if we plug our computers

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,950
into the outlets on the wall because

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,570
I've had venues that have gotten upset

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,940
when people have brought their own

00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:40,890
extension cords and plug their computers

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:43,170
into the wall don't be afraid to ask how

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:46,560
much is it going to cost us for the

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:48,630
pictures of water on the table because

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,450
I've had venues that have charged me

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:58,290
five dollars per pitcher for the tap

00:09:51,450 --> 00:10:00,240
water on the table every venue is going

00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:03,720
to have their own little hidden gimmicks

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,490
to try to make money off of you that's

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,800
the way they operate there are business

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,990
there for profit and if you're not here

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,160
if you're not here they're going to have

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,910
somebody else here that they can make

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,610
money off of so be aware of that so

00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:21,960
all common techniques that venues will

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:24,330
use to try to make some money off of you

00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,220
first of all they're going to have this

00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,390
thing called a service charge it's going

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,120
to be hidden in their contracts

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:33,230
somewhere and what the service charge is

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,610
is it's about a 20 to 25 percent charge

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,590
that's going to appear on your master

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,740
bill at the end of the conference that's

00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,180
the only place it's going to appear

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,040
every time they send you a quote and say

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,390
oh yeah we can do that for you it's

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,120
going to be a fifty-dollar charge for

00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:50,790
this or yes this food here is going to

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,910
be seventeen dollars per person they're

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:56,220
never going to say plus the service

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,750
charge so you've got to keep that in the

00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,640
back of your head constantly what's the

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,870
service charge what's the real price

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:06,750
that they're going to charge me at the

00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:11,150
end of this venues will require you to

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:14,460
use their catering service if it's a

00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:18,480
university they most likely have out

00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:21,000
sourced their food prep to some large

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,690
organization for example aramark is very

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,990
popular and usually to get the best deal

00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:30,660
with those food prep organizations the

00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,390
universities have given out exclusive

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,940
rights to those companies so for example

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,740
if you have a university that's using

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,020
air mark somewhere in their contract

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,390
between the University and air mark it

00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,720
says nobody else except aramark is going

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:49,710
to serve food on this campus and if

00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,650
that's the case you're stuck going with

00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:56,250
them at their prices and believe me

00:11:52,650 --> 00:12:00,930
their prices are crazy if you've enjoyed

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:02,640
a bottle of water at this yap see TPF

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:07,140
paid three dollars for that bottle of

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:11,250
water if you've enjoyed a bottle of a

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:14,370
can of soda TPF paid three dollars for

00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:18,380
that can of soda that's the way it works

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,380
plus plus the service church

00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:24,250
so when people see that it costs a

00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:28,740
hundred and thirty thousand dollars to

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:31,780
run a Yap see that's a big reason why

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,060
last year at Yap see we had a social

00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,730
event on tuesday night we had the

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:39,250
banquet and the reason that we're not

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:44,770
having the banquet this year is because

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:48,790
we ordered food for 350 people at forty

00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:55,630
dollars per plate and we had about 150

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:58,870
show up plus the service charge so it's

00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:00,580
expensive it's very expensive and and

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,020
you have to watch out for what you're

00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:06,490
doing so a lot of times when you're

00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:08,500
running an event it's a good idea to try

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,880
to find locations off-site if you can to

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,880
have some of your some of your meals

00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:20,620
there's an interesting thing that hotels

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:23,560
have called patching fees now AV

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:28,830
equipment is super expensive at a

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:32,140
conference to rent a projector at a

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:34,900
conference I kid you not it was

00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,839
literally cheaper for TPF to go out and

00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,839
purchase the projectors that we're using

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,740
this week then to rent them from the

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:47,320
hotel for a week we can we can buy that

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,170
projector right there use it all week

00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:53,890
throw it in the dumpster at the end of

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:56,020
the week and save money over what it

00:13:53,890 --> 00:14:01,690
would have cost to rent the projector

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:03,900
just a minute or e that's a good

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,900
question

00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:12,010
so hotels know this they understand that

00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:13,829
that's what's going on so they've

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,510
invented this thing called patching fees

00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:18,459
what the patching fee is basically if

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,980
you're going to bring your equipment

00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:23,110
into our hotel and expect to plug into

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,630
any of our systems at all we're going to

00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:28,570
charge you a fee for plugging your cord

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:31,290
into our system and that's a patching

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,820
fee so for example these are our

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,279
microphones and our audio mixer but

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,380
we're using their house system so we've

00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,769
paid fifty dollars for the right to plug

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:46,180
this microphone into their speakers and

00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:51,899
that's how they make money room

00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:54,760
attrition room attrition is basically

00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:57,339
we've asked the hotel to reserve a

00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,610
certain number of rooms for our event we

00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:02,769
say we want 720 room nights for this

00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:05,769
event and we want you to give us a good

00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:08,500
rate and they say okay we'll get we'll

00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:10,620
set aside 720 room nights for this event

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,899
and we'll give you this price per night

00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,699
but you have to promise us that at least

00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:18,490
eighty five percent of those rooms are

00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:20,260
going to be filled if you don't get to

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,480
that eighty-five percent mark we're

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,620
going to charge you for the difference

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:29,680
that's what room attrition is so

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:31,930
conferences expect you at least nine

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,510
months ahead of your event to know

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:38,860
exactly how many rooms you're going to

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:40,449
need to book for their event okay so two

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,810
documents that you need to know about

00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:46,420
the the event contract and something

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,310
called the beo the contracts pretty

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,709
self-explanatory it's the agreement with

00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:53,500
a hotel where you say this is how much

00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:55,540
we're going to pay this is what what

00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,540
services they're going to provide in a

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:02,649
broad overview the other contract is

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:05,890
called the beo the beo is your enemy the

00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:08,769
beo stands for banquet event order and

00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:11,440
it is a written detailed specification

00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:13,870
of exactly what's going to happen during

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,170
your event and exactly how much every

00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,100
single item is going to cost the beo for

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,430
this event

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:25,180
that you're at right now was 17 pages

00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:28,360
long and it lists line by line by line

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,940
and you have to you have to read every

00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,220
line and check off every item and then

00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,060
you'll call the hotel and say okay we

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:38,529
need to make these changes and they will

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,029
generate a brand new set of be eos and

00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,410
send it to you and you have to read it

00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:45,329
line by line to make sure they only

00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:49,149
change the things that you asked for so

00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:51,940
yeah like i said i'm trying to try to

00:16:49,149 --> 00:17:01,930
encourage you to do this so i'm going to

00:16:51,940 --> 00:17:07,120
move on now well it's paid for so you

00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:10,329
better enjoy it that's okay so what I

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:13,150
want to say is simply I want you to if

00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:15,909
you are into this keep trying and if and

00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:17,199
by that I mean plan is if you're going

00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,689
to do it again even if you have no

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:23,199
intention of doing it again plan as if

00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:24,579
you are keep records keep track of what

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,319
worked and what didn't at the end of

00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,480
your conference everybody sit down and

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,130
talk about what worked and what didn't

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,490
put together a document that's what we

00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:36,669
do for you app see last year on the

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:38,650
thursday after yap see we all got

00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:40,780
together at a restaurant and utah and

00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,669
started talking about what worked what

00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,799
didn't we put together a document and

00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:48,789
that was meeting one of the planning

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:51,130
team for the for this year even if you

00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:54,760
even if you never run an event again

00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:58,059
it's useful to have that data it heck

00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:03,309
publish it let other people learn from

00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:04,720
your mistakes focus on how you might

00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:09,400
want to improve your event in the future

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,919
this year TPF made a decent capital

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,539
expenditure on AV equipment for this

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,370
event with the intention that we can use

00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:18,159
it year after year we're looking ahead

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,620
and we're saying okay how can we not

00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:23,860
only improve this event but make future

00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,510
events even better some of you might be

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,770
saying okay well that's great but i'm

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:31,480
not interested in working a pearl

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:33,670
workshop i want to host yap see well

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,600
that's great I want you to host you op C

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:39,850
to the days of local pro longer groups

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,150
going off on their own and hosting a gap

00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:45,160
see are pretty much over at this point

00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,680
we have a conferences committee we have

00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,880
a team and that team is going to have

00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,340
someone that's going to be the lead

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,710
organizer so if you want to be a lead

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,500
organizer get involved with the app see

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,820
get involved this thursday we're going

00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,280
to be going out to a restaurant and

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:08,710
talking about what we're going to do

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:10,030
next time so get it get involved so but

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,400
there's still a place for a local team

00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:16,090
if if you want to see yap see in your

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,770
town there are still things that that we

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,240
can have you help with the

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:22,450
responsibilities are going to vary year

00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,340
to year we're going to we what we want

00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:29,560
is people that can help bring the local

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:30,850
flavor to the event so I didn't bring I

00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,420
didn't have enough time for questions

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:39,940
but I'll be available for questions

00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:42,250
pretty much any time and I guess my

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,990
point here is we want to see you get

00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,210
involved we want to see more Pro

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:49,150
conferences happen we want to see Pearl

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,410
workshops all across the country anybody
