hi I'm John Radcliffe I'm the director

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,730
of engineering at active state software

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,340
and it's my pleasure to be here talking

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,620
to a roomful of people every single one

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:20,369
of whom knows more about Perl than I

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:22,800
give so Who am I I'm a physicist by

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,689
education I dropped out of academia

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,430
during the dot-com boom when they would

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,310
hire anybody who was warm and breathing

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:32,610
and could write a little code and in

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,070
2016 I was one of about 1400 physicists

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,420
who were honored with the 2016

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,629
breakthrough prize in fundamental

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,399
physics for work on neutrino physics I

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:45,120
was a postdoc with the Sudbury neutrino

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,300
Observatory in the 1990s working on

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,739
detector simulation calibration building

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,850
radiation sources for detected

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:56,010
calibration and writing code to move the

00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:00,660
drive the robotic manipulator to move

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,340
sources around the detector and and thus

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,260
no results combined with results from

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,390
other neutrino detectors around the

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,130
world demonstrated that neutrinos have

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,439
mass which was one of the big open

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,890
questions in physics in the 20th century

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,740
I am a lapsed pearl person one of my

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,170
first jobs in the commercial world was

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,689
on an application called gene linker

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:27,570
which was a desktop data analysis tool

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:30,509
for genomics that had an embedded pearl

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,070
engine for user scripting and I was

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,829
doing a lot of Perl at the time though

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,540
the Perl was the only scripting language

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,979
that that I kind of allowed people to

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,659
use in the company I wanted us all

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,090
focused on Perl because it did

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,439
everything and it did it very easily we

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,829
didn't need half a dozen little

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,680
languages we just needed Perl around

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:53,430
about 2005 for one reason or another I

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,649
moved into doing more Python partly

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,299
because like the Perl native object

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,079
system was too complicated for me and I

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:04,640
didn't understand it and have spent most

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,020
of the time since doing embedded C

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,979
algorithm development for medical

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,310
imaging for

00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:14,349
a computer-assisted surgery and some

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,170
prototyping in Python but I haven't

00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:20,280
really looked at Perl literally in about

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:25,120
10 years until I joined active State in

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,010
August of or July of 2015 so I haven't

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,049
been with a company for quite a year I

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,480
am the director of engineering there and

00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:35,200
we I'll talk a little bit about all the

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,730
things the company does active state as

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,319
many of you probably know has been

00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,209
around for a long time in the Perl world

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,349
it was a vey originally founded to

00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:47,500
supply Perl on Windows in 1997 when Perl

00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:49,870
on Windows was really hard to do it has

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,150
gone through a number of iterations that

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,519
I will talk about it currently supports

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:58,390
we currently support everything from 5-8

00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:01,599
to 524 on a huge range of hardware and

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:03,879
we are an enterprise support company

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,370
basically we sells Perl to the

00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,890
enterprise and there are a lot of large

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:12,069
organizations in the world running a lot

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,079
of Perl on really old hardware I have

00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:16,030
this vision of some of our large

00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:19,150
customers having sort of Indiana

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,549
jones-style warehouses full of AIX and

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:25,599
hp-ux boxes all of which are running

00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:29,470
Perl jobs so if anybody wants 32-bit you

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,849
know five ten on each box on titanium we

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,639
actually ship that to some of our

00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:35,079
enterprise customers I sometimes really

00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,329
wonder what they're doing with it and

00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:38,250
other times I'm not sure I really want

00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:41,739
to know

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,810
in the early 2000s active State was

00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,849
bought because they had written a spam

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,530
filter in Perl that was really good and

00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:51,010
you could get bought for a spam filter

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:53,950
back in those days the acquirer didn't

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,500
really want the the core languages they

00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,569
wanted the spam filter so they spun the

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,000
language part of the company back out

00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:03,220
and so that was active state 1.0 which

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,609
became what we think of his active state

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:09,280
2.0 which continued to ship active Perl

00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:11,620
added active Python and active tickle

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,079
tool command language we also have

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,469
Komodo IDE which is a development tool

00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:20,109
and a tickle dev kit and a perl dev kit

00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:20,850
Perl dev kit has got a debugger it has a

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:23,450
propping

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,580
has a whole bunch of features that

00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,770
iteration of the company decided to

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,830
build a private platform as-a-service

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,480
I'm not totally sure what that means

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,490
called staccato which was very

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:40,410
successful and was bought by

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:42,510
hewlett-packard in August of 2014 where

00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,460
2015 rather which sounds like it was a

00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,460
month after I joined the company it was

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:51,810
actually about three days I joined July

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:54,780
28 the staccato unit was sold August

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,310
third so I had to come up to speak very

00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,890
quickly because some of our senior

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,560
people went with the sale and it's been

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,800
a very exciting year moving the company

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,960
forward since that time and things have

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,730
settled down now we're shipping the

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,830
languages that we have always shipped

00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:13,080
we're shipping the development tools

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,240
Komodo Kent komodo ken has just been

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,760
released with all kinds of awesome new

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,980
features and we are looking around and

00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,220
asking okay if this is active state 3.0

00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,710
what are we gonna do next I'm mostly a

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,360
Python guy so I came into the company

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,270
thinking well you know Python is cool

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,160
python is the future and I started

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,100
looking at what our customers were doing

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,500
and how they were doing it and I

00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,930
realized that maybe I should have been

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,260
paying attention to Perl a little more

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:47,070
for the last decade so part of this talk

00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,600
is sort of Tom's Perl revelation that I

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,180
think there are probably a lot of people

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,340
out there like me who for one reason or

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,430
another drifted away from Perl 10 years

00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,830
ago who now we have a great opportunity

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,320
to entice back I think it's a very

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,390
exciting time for the language and I've

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,760
started to think about this as the Perl

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,560
Renaissance which I have almost heard

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,690
those words out of people's mouths if

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,670
nobody else has said them they've said

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,700
things very close to that and I think

00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:17,700
that the data that I'll show really

00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,770
validates that reality that we are in

00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,170
the midst of a Perl Renaissance which is

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,030
not at all what I was expecting when I

00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:26,400
wrote the abstract for this talk for

00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,800
example so things are gonna gonna wander

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,970
around a little bit what I thought I was

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,490
talking about was just what I thought of

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,960
the Perl paradox which is literally

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,370
nobody talks about

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,660
I hadn't heard about it I hadn't gone

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,600
looking for it but I hadn't heard about

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,460
it whereas I had heard about Haskell say

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,039
in the last ten years I hadn't really

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,229
heard about Perl but looking at our

00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:50,759
customers and other people in the world

00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:54,090
it's clear that everyone depends on Perl

00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,050
and it got me really wondering what's

00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,740
going on here

00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:04,490
why is it that a language everyone

00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:08,039
depends on is basically invisible unless

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,419
an invisible sometimes frequently over

00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,490
the last few years especially when

00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:14,430
people have talked about Perl they've

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:20,340
talked about it in fairly negative terms

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:24,139
as if it was this legacy edifice that

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:28,020
was impressive and amazing in ancient

00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:30,479
but not really lively and active and

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,880
interesting which is not at all what I

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:38,460
was seeing that's a quote from Fast

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:40,949
Company in 2014 now and it is stated in

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,419
this weird way but prognosticators in

00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:45,389
the press tend to state things which is

00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:47,490
basically if the cause of X happens then

00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:49,080
X might happen if you read that that

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,289
quote carefully which looks very

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,199
prescient if X actually happens and can

00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:56,520
be shrugged off if X doesn't happen I'm

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,289
going to talk a little bit about

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,900
committing to your beliefs in in a bit

00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:06,300
one of the fun things about working at

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:10,050
active state is I get to talk to Gartner

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,650
analysts who are incredibly smart people

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:17,909
and have a ridiculously deep knowledge

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:20,729
of the fields that they study I'm amazed

00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:23,400
by the information that they can bring

00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:26,099
back to us and when we talk to them

00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,620
about Perl they literally say no one

00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:30,930
talks to them about Perl that it's been

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,789
years since anyone has come to them and

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,400
asked for instance a typical question

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:38,580
they might get is I'm starting this new

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:41,550
project should I use one of these two or

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,380
three languages Perl doesn't come up in

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,660
those conversations

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,700
apparently I think there's reasons for

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:51,110
that that aren't as

00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:53,900
had as some might infer on the other

00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,570
hand I'm sure you've all seen pearl was

00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,860
back in the top ten which is kind of

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,860
exciting you know you can argue about

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,240
whether or not the TLB rankings are you

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,570
know the best possible measure of

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,550
language popularity you can argue

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,950
whether or not you know as a as a

00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,480
skeptical physicist I would be apt to

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,100
say that that line looks kind of flat

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,050
and I need a few more years of data

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,630
before I'm convinced that it's rising

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,970
but this is not the only data we have

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:22,190
there's other information that I'll be

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,530
talking about because for example the

00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,510
big the big thing that I saw inside of

00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:29,590
active state almost immediately is our

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,850
pearl business is large and growing and

00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,040
there's no way that's consistent with

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:37,250
what everybody or many people out there

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:40,340
are saying about pearl how how can this

00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:44,060
be and when we talk to our customers

00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:46,850
directly we get this kind of feedback

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,130
that they're using more pearl that

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,790
companies that they're working with are

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,710
using pearl that various internal groups

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:57,920
doing more and more sophisticated things

00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,840
are using pearl in this figure of 10,000

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,430
jobs has actually come up that specific

00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,660
number has come up a couple of times

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,570
talking to completely different

00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,010
customers in completely different

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,780
industries on opposite sides of the

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,670
Atlantic where they say yeah we have

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,350
10,000 you know production jobs you're

00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,870
running scripts automation and what have

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,210
you that are handling moving data around

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:19,640
inside our business all of which are

00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:22,390
written in Perl so there's something

00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,980
something interesting going on there

00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,900
there is also the famous Gartner market

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:31,400
clock and I was unfortunately not able

00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:34,160
to find a version of this from 2013 but

00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,380
I have heard a rumor that they'd

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,500
actually pushed Perl into obsolescence

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:42,500
and then brought it back I I can't

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:46,040
confirm that but I have heard that the

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,230
display here shows the maturity of a

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,570
technology around the circumference

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,970
although slightly weirdly the zenith is

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,350
at the bottom which I presume is what

00:10:52,970 --> 00:11:02,700
happens when an MBA uses an astronaut

00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:05,280
metaphor and the radial axis the radial

00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,780
Direction dimension is the degree of

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,360
commercialization or industrialization

00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,730
and you'll see that pearl is sitting

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,720
over there it's a pretty good company

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:17,580
with C with C++ they pushed Fortran past

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,290
the threshold of obsolescence although

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:23,520
my friends who do computational fluid

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:26,100
dynamics might argue vigorously to the

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,320
contrary I don't think any of us are

00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,650
ever likely to fly in an aircraft that

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,260
doesn't have some Fortran in the design

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:37,620
the other thing that I've added to the

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:40,050
to the clock is a fork not the not the

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,550
source code repo fork but the table

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:47,610
utensil we think of technology as

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:49,950
something that grows matures and then

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:53,520
dies and we have reasons for that we've

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:56,340
seen a lot of that in the last 30 40

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:59,880
even 50 years new technology that

00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:03,330
becomes mature you know the VHS that is

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:06,390
everywhere and then it disappears this

00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:09,180
is actually pretty any typical Forks

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,430
were introduced as tableware not not as

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:15,180
cookware into the english-speaking world

00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:17,130
in the early 1600s and they were

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,050
controversial they were talked about

00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,030
apparently there were church people who

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:24,320
condemned them because it was impious

00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:27,270
not to touch God's food with your hands

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,210
but they didn't go away they didn't

00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:32,130
become obsolete forks are everywhere but

00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,960
nobody talks about them just like pearl

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,060
and I think there are differences but

00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,880
it's something to keep in mind that I

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:42,300
think we have a very strong bias toward

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,940
the new toward the novel and an implicit

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,700
assumption that anything which is not

00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:50,100
new novel and growing in technology is

00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,620
going away and dying and I don't think

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,770
that's the case at all I expect that

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:59,130
people will be writing C long after I am

00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:01,020
gone and turned to dust I don't think it

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,460
is a language that solves the problem it

00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,130
was meant to solve extraordinarily well

00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,270
it will be very hard to replace and I

00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,970
think there's a similar argument to be

00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:11,949
made for pearl

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,959
so I asked myself a moral point I asked

00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:16,059
the marketing people what's going on

00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,920
explain this to me I'm just a dumb

00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:22,779
technology guy you tell me what's going

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:25,809
on in the market and they answered me we

00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:30,369
have over a hundred thousand downloads

00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:33,239
of active pearl every month and we ask

00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:35,350
people for their email addresses and

00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:37,779
some small fraction of them a few

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:45,549
percent actually give them to us good

00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:48,279
email addresses not faq.com out of the

00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:50,889
the numbers so we sent an eighteen

00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,939
thousand surveys to ask people a bunch

00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:54,610
of questions about what they're doing

00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:56,860
with pearl and we got three hundred

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,119
fifty odd responses back which is it's a

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,759
two percent response rate so we're

00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:04,269
talking about 0.4 percent maybe of our

00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:06,939
total population here nonetheless I'm

00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:09,759
going to argue going to kind of put some

00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:12,490
scientific purity behind me and that we

00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,660
can look at these data and possibly draw

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,619
some interesting conclusions about

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,480
what's going on in the pearl market one

00:14:17,619 --> 00:14:21,369
of the interesting things is that we

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,439
have enough responses about a hundred

00:14:21,369 --> 00:14:25,869
people who are using pearl in commercial

00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:27,939
uses versus 200 odd that are using it as

00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:29,709
individuals to split those out and

00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:31,869
analyze them separately and we'll see

00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:35,139
some patterns in the data that suggest

00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:36,759
there's some legitimacy in in inferring

00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:38,259
things from this and the kind of

00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,689
questions we ask this is not the

00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:43,809
complete set but you know what version

00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:45,939
platform of you are you running how long

00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:48,040
have you been doing this what industry

00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:50,740
are you in what are you doing with it

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:54,009
and how can for us particularly hook I'm

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,839
actor pearl and not something else so

00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:59,679
I'm gonna be a little Bayesian interlude

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:02,019
because I am a committed Bayesian a lot

00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:04,119
of the work in the nineties on on hard

00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:07,419
statistical problems led us toward

00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:09,999
Bayesian style inference because it lets

00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:13,029
us fold in prior beliefs you know in a

00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:15,100
natural and controllable way and the

00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:16,569
important thing about Bayesian reasoning

00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,220
they're a couple of important things one

00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:20,379
is that certainty is off the table I

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,000
personally believe that certainty was a

00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:24,660
mistake

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I liken it to Alchemist search for the

00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,220
Philosopher's Stone they did all this

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,360
interesting stuff but they were solving

00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,560
the wrong problem they were searching

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,080
for something that would turn base

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,950
metals into gold which we know basically

00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,840
can't be done

00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,730
philosophers spent thousands of years

00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,860
searching for certainty and I think

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,540
their arguments why that's a bad goal

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,020
even though they did lots of interesting

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,060
stuff

00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,250
what Bayesian czar interested in is

00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,770
what's more plausible and what's less

00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:53,280
plausible one of the nice things about

00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:55,440
that is that it makes arguments much

00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,480
more continuous rather than binary and

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,210
you can you can start to see and value

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:04,440
and get value out of diverse points of

00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:07,500
view the fundamental thing that the base

00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,920
theorem runs on the idea that rare

00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:13,830
events that would be made less rare if

00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,750
something was true constitute good

00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:18,030
evidence for that thing being true or

00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:20,820
more plausible at least that's the

00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:23,670
fundamental thing that drives it and I

00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:28,610
like when I'm even doing an informal

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:31,470
analysis to commit myself to a favorite

00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:34,260
hypothesis to ask myself upfront why do

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:37,680
I really believe and that forces me to

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:40,260
confront the data in a particular way

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,030
where if I have a bunch of things that I

00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,550
believe that are contradicted by the

00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:46,320
data I can't say oh yeah well that was

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,420
obvious because I've already committed

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,089
myself it didn't write it there's a good

00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,520
book by this guy Duncan Watts called

00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:56,760
everything is obvious in the sub

00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:59,310
subtitle is once you know the answer and

00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,960
he's talking fundamentally about how we

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,140
convince ourselves as things are obvious

00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:06,209
after we know the data

00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:08,400
curiously were lousy at predicting what

00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:11,250
the data should be beforehand which of

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,130
things were genuinely obvious they'd be

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,560
predictable they aren't so I held myself

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,540
to account and I wrote down what I

00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,680
thought and to an extent what we thought

00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:24,900
within the company was the the what we

00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,180
expected the survey results to be based

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,040
on our various our hypotheses about the

00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,330
language we expected it would be mostly

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,150
Windows because we're a Perl on Windows

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,330
Company and Perl ships with Linux why

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,280
would they use ours

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:38,020
we thought older versions I certainly

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,150
thought older versions would predominate

00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:43,120
because I was thinking about pearl is a

00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:44,500
legacy language used in legacy systems

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,080
why would people be upgrading when

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,810
they're running old code likewise I was

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,450
expecting pearl devs they're gonna get

00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:54,280
old the more you know the longer we back

00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,020
going the the further more experience we

00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,110
get we're gonna see this ramp up we're

00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:01,120
not gonna see new young pearl hips

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:04,660
because it's a legacy language little

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,630
did I know I expected most use would be

00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,310
in software and IT rather than non

00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,200
software industries because it's a hard

00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:13,240
core language programmers are going to

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,150
be using it not non-programmers not

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:19,060
engineers analysts people like this and

00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:21,040
I was expecting pearl was gonna be web

00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,870
related and you can probably tell

00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,530
looking at this that I didn't know very

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:28,330
much

00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:30,280
and I learned we saw a lot of Linux in

00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:32,320
the responses and I'm still not sure why

00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,710
this is part of it maybe we ship exactly

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,720
the same stuff on multiple platforms and

00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,640
we do know from our commercial customers

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,160
the people like that I'd like to be able

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,020
to run exactly the same thing on Windows

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,880
on Linux on Solaris or whatever

00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:48,760
combination they're running so they're

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,260
never chasing bugs because oh we're

00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,630
using a different version of some module

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:55,960
here rather than there but we need to

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:58,120
dig more deeply into that I'm going to

00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,740
show graphs of this in a bit but I like

00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,280
to look at the raw numbers first because

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,840
it gets a little complicated we do see

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,120
older versions or bumping up in too

00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,810
close to the double digits then there's

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,210
this lull in the middle and then usage

00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:16,690
ramps up with later versions quite

00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:19,270
dramatically and the years of experience

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,980
are probably the most startling thing in

00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,540
the data and again this is 0.4 percent

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,550
of our total you know there's several

00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,760
million downloads over this we got 350

00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:30,780
people nonetheless we are seeing almost

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,730
how well more than half the developers

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,830
in the individual users who have been

00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,410
using Perl for less than three years and

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:40,360
about a third in the commercial users

00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,640
who have been using Perl for less than

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,870
three years these are new people coming

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,940
to the language they aren't necessarily

00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:48,400
young people with their developers who

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,370
have come to Perl and started using Perl

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,049
in the last three years weirdly because

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,940
the the survey was designed by marketing

00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:58,120
people we somehow left out the four year

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,980
mark we'll do better

00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,320
we'll do better next time so there are

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,960
no I don't know what people did if they

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,490
if they were using the language for four

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,350
years they may have answered various

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,179
ways we do see a lot of older Perl devs

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,220
especially you'll notice this is one of

00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:14,200
the patterns there's more people in the

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,929
commercial world who have more

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,919
experience than in individual users

00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:19,600
which is one of the things you would

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,669
expect so that that does help validate

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,120
that there's something interesting going

00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:27,970
on here in terms of experience so that's

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:32,649
this is all those tables summed up in a

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:34,510
single graph the turquoise is individual

00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,500
users the green is corporate users I

00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,630
probably could have chosen more

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,940
different colors the interesting thing

00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:42,399
to me is this is the the x axis here is

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:45,880
the year a particular version of Perl

00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:47,860
was released and as you can see was we

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,159
know there were some big gaps in the

00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:54,159
release schedule between 2000 and 2010

00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,600
and we do see other than the the 510

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,350
release which is a bit of a blip but we

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:03,360
basically see a decline in the version

00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:07,570
that people are using in that period and

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,360
then in 2010 the Perl community to its

00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:13,480
great credit started producing yearly

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:17,830
releases with an regular cadence new

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:22,390
features bug fixes the whole bit and we

00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:24,850
see this strong powerful ramp up in

00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:28,000
adoption and again we see individual

00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,770
users have a steeper curve than the

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,240
corporate users which is what you would

00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:33,490
expect individuals are tending to

00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,710
upgrade more quickly this is small

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:39,070
medium business use typically they're

00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:41,350
hanging back a little bit and if we add

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,940
our enterprise users which are large

00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:46,000
enterprises this is from different data

00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,890
set fold it in you can see the peak is

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,220
at 516 that number actually goes up to

00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:53,529
30% so our large enterprises as you

00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:58,059
would expect are hanging back even more

00:21:53,529 --> 00:22:02,120
I would love to know why what how the

00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:05,360
people who were using 5 10 5 6 + 5 8

00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,580
are doing what is keeping them on those

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,470
versions of the language and that's

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,330
something we'll be looking at later as

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:14,059
well because undoubtedly the world would

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:16,340
be a better place if those people could

00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:21,080
be shepherded forward to a more modern

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:22,670
version of Perl so that's the core of my

00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,929
story that that curve is a pearl

00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:26,990
Renaissance which I will come back to

00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:31,040
you nonetheless we also asked where are

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:33,500
people using this language and we saw a

00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,169
lot in software but if you can see more

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,540
than half is in non software related

00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:40,220
industries we knew that there was a lot

00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,169
in finance and some in healthcare in

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,760
government telecoms and semiconductors

00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:45,470
were surprises to us we were to where we

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,179
were we're getting that much uptake

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,429
there we get a lot of pickle use there

00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:51,850
because tickle gets use to drive command

00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:54,080
tools in some electronic design

00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:56,480
processes but there's a lot of Perl

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,179
being used there as well and of course

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,750
somebody is using it for beer which can

00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:01,750
only be a good thing

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:05,540
likewise when I was expecting everything

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,540
would be or at least it would be

00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:11,840
dominated by web use this turns out not

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:14,480
to be the case general scripting data

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,580
transformation were the absolutely

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:22,100
dominant uses of Perl throughout the

00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:23,330
enterprise web is 7% overall so what

00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,070
people are using Perl for is

00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,140
fundamentally a general-purpose

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:31,400
scripting language optimized for data

00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:33,950
transformation that that was a surprise

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,850
Perl has become the duct tape of the

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:40,970
enterprise it's through a small medium

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:42,980
and large enterprises and this is a word

00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,530
cloud of what individuals are using it

00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,830
for you can see a lot of data processing

00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,520
text parsing the symbol informatics up

00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,179
at the top

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,679
manipulation scripting applications all

00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:56,600
general programming tasks I don't even

00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:59,480
web is on here someplace but I don't

00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:03,799
think it's big enough to see corporate

00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,570
uses data processing analysis scripting

00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:07,370
scripts web there you can see people are

00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,470
still driving websites with Perl which

00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:12,890
is not a bad thing but it's by no means

00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:15,880
the dominant use of the language in the

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,660
enterprise just a lot of general purpose

00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,010
processing and transformation and we

00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,590
wanted to know why are using active Pro

00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:24,680
windows does loom large ease of

00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:29,240
installation looms large this is for

00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:32,150
individuals and for corporations support

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:35,240
is is a big thing having a one company

00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:37,520
that supports this language on Windows

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,780
matters to some people that if you're

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,050
running a large enterprise where you

00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,820
have mission-critical processes that are

00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,020
depending on a language you want to be

00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,610
able to pick up the phone you want to be

00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,950
able to email and you want to be able to

00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,930
get help so that was that was gratifying

00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:55,190
to us it made us feel we were providing

00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:58,160
some value for the world resolution of

00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:59,240
the paradox of why nobody talks about

00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,820
currently even though everyone's depends

00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,220
on is it really was this wall in Pearl

00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:06,130
adoption three to five years ago that

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:08,300
wasn't that was a real phenomenon and

00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,430
the yearly release cadence the new

00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:13,640
features the the back porting of

00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:15,770
features from Perl six the vigor and

00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,260
vitality of the community have

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,720
absolutely turned that around

00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:23,480
so today Perl is ubiquitous in the back

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,850
rooms of the enterprise people are using

00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,240
it and the reason why nobody is going to

00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:31,190
Gartner and asking should I use pearl in

00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,600
this project is because if you were to

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,530
build an automobile you wouldn't go and

00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:38,090
ask an expert should it have four wheels

00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:39,680
you don't ask if you need to use Perl or

00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,860
you should use Perl because you know

00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:46,180
it's the right tool for the job we don't

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:49,400
talk about decisions that are easy and

00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:51,890
Perl is easy it's easy to decide to use

00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,380
it and it's easy to use once you have

00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,880
decided to use it that's fundamentally I

00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,970
think the story that these data are

00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,380
telling us so this is kind of a summary

00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,750
don't buy the marketing people so it's

00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:06,620
prettier

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:10,520
almost half of developers are have have

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:12,950
three years or fewer experience with

00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,170
Perl which is just an amazing statistic

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,830
people are out there learning the

00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,960
language

00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:20,510
today we're adopting new members into

00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,100
the community and we have kind of three

00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:24,770
ages of Perl we have a classical

00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,350
antiquity back in the 90s we had a bit

00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,560
of alone in the Middle Ages and we are

00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,140
now very much

00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,980
in the middle of a Pearl Renaissance and

00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:37,650
that is the conversation that active

00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:40,350
state wants to be part of we have a

00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:43,560
language with speed power flexibility

00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:46,320
ease of use comprehensiveness back in my

00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:50,460
pearl days I did die I did things like

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,680
solve OD ease in Pearl why because I

00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,270
could just pull out OD e solver off of

00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,860
Sipan and it worked I didn't have to

00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,340
think about it was it the fastest thing

00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,210
in the world

00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,800
no but it just worked and Sipan as we

00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,480
all know is expanded enormously since

00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,130
then it's become easier to use

00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,530
there's better infrastructure it's

00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:11,000
easier to find things testing is more

00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:14,010
comprehensive and I feel foolish I

00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,360
drifted away from pearl ten years ago

00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:19,140
and I think a lot of people out there

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:22,260
are like me and we just haven't thought

00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,500
about the language since so I'm very

00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:28,230
excited about the possibilities of

00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:30,630
engaging with people like me laps pearl

00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,700
people and bringing them back and

00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,430
showing them how amazing pearl has

00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:38,130
become and how much more amazing it will

00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:47,390
become in the future and that's what I

00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:49,400
have we have

00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:53,950
we have time so feel free to ask

00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,950
questions make comments throw stones yes

00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:05,020
yep yes yeah

00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,779
bye-bye

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,280
he is certainly possible given how

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:31,810
sparse the sample is sure as I said

00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,930
there are patterns and the data that

00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:38,770
make me think yeah there's there's

00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:41,620
something here the it's it's it's hard

00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:43,270
to make the case that less than 1%

00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,390
overall that have gone through two

00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:48,550
different filters are going to be you

00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:53,470
know hugely gregorio necessarily

00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:55,090
representative but when you when you

00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,130
when you when you really understand both

00:28:55,090 --> 00:29:02,260
ings and you just get no I or you and

00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:04,840
you've got a correlation you've got self

00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,610
selection going on it typically comes

00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,440
out in the data you can typically see

00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:11,220
things in the analysis that are that are

00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,190
in the data that are affected by that

00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:17,170
that give you reason to doubt it I

00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:19,600
haven't seen that in in these data

00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:21,010
I've run various tests it doesn't mean

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,030
that they aren't there and I'm just

00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:26,890
missing them but until I'm contradicted

00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,450
I'm gonna remain hopeful and we are

00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,460
looking at you know following up on this

00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:33,370
now we're talking with our enterprise

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,530
customers and a lot of detail and a lot

00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:38,770
of the things we're hearing in those

00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:40,720
conversations confirm this when a

00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:42,700
company tells you know we see new

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,800
developers coming to the language when a

00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,180
company tells you they're increasing

00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,550
their adoption of Perl well they're

00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,930
gonna have to hire more Perl developers

00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,260
which is going to bring new developers

00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:55,810
into the language so there's a lot of

00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:59,320
ancillary information that I think tends

00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:02,790
to make the idea that we're undergoing a

00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,790
Perl Renaissance more plausible

00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:24,020
yeah we're selling to most of the

00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:26,060
fortune 1000 so we're selling to most of

00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,730
the people most of the people that

00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:31,160
Gartner's talking to so there's a

00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:56,450
considerable overlap between those

00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:58,730
groups yeah

00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:03,290
the answers basically no to both we have

00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:04,870
not dug into the act of Python customers

00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:07,460
Python is a smaller part of our business

00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:13,460
so this is where we focus our efforts

00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:15,230
initially on on Perl and getting real

00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,230
data on languages like Scala and go

00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:19,910
figuring out adoption curves is

00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,740
extraordinarily challenging we're

00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:24,410
fortunate that our customers will

00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,670
genuinely talk to us but even that can

00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,520
be a challenge because you talk to a

00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:30,650
bank for example they don't really want

00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,670
to give you too much information about

00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:34,730
what they're doing and that's absolutely

00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:36,530
as it should be but it does make it

00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,970
difficult for us to determine what their

00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:43,870
internal adoption rates for various

00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:43,870
languages really are yep

00:31:51,890 --> 00:32:01,770
you would assume that some of our we're

00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:05,760
working on improving our internal data

00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:08,610
capture a lot there was the center of

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,440
gravity of the company during the

00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:16,110
staccato years very much shifted toward

00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:20,250
that that part of the of the enterprise

00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:22,950
and it did mean that a lot of the things

00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,750
you would think we were doing we maybe

00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:27,030
haven't been doing as well as we would

00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:30,570
like in the last three to five years and

00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:32,730
part of my mandate is to make all of

00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:35,010
that better and now that we're through

00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:37,680
the transition period we're running on

00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:43,830
all cylinders we're very much focused on

00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:45,660
asking questions of that kind we do well

00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:47,400
one of the things I've done actually is

00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:51,780
insisted that all scripting in the

00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:53,190
company being Perl because I I think we

00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,480
don't want a proliferation of languages

00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,800
in the company we don't want yeah I've

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,060
been in places where we've had half a

00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,760
dozen scripts written in half a dozen

00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,450
languages and when the guy who knows you

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,730
know awk

00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,650
for example leaves well then somebody

00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:11,970
has to decipher so why not do it in Perl

00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:15,240
in the first place Hermey Komodo is in

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:17,870
Python yeah so that I'm that in

00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,870
JavaScript

00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:33,580
that's possible although I would argue

00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:36,580
that the modern pearl movement is is a

00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:39,099
good piece of marketing to call us

00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:41,889
around because modern pearl is not pearl

00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:44,679
as I learned modern pearl has got all

00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:46,990
these cool things that either weren't

00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:49,780
there or we weren't doing back in the

00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,369
day so I do think that that there are

00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,080
opportunities modern pearl pearl

00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:56,800
Renaissance there are various things we

00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:59,859
can do to convince people which should

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,130
be easy because it's true that pearl is

00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:04,599
a modern dynamic first-class programming

00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:07,109
language that they should be paying

00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:07,109
attention to

00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:15,110
I I think the too late yeah I think

00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:17,270
given given the facts on the ground what

00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,590
we should be focusing on is is talking

00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:21,770
about modern curls talking about the

00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:23,930
Pearl Renaissance talking about the cool

00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:26,510
and amazing things that people are

00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:28,160
actually doing in the enterprise today

00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:29,890
from from our perspective and on the

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,460
desktop and in the scientific community

00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:36,850
there's incredible things going on and

00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:40,450
we should just not be shy about

00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:40,450
celebrating those things

00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:50,380
yep you see a lot of Python in academia

00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,730
no no doubt about that and one of the

00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,920
problems is that the kind of people who

00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:55,750
are using Perl are large enterprises

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,540
banks financial institutions insurance

00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:00,790
companies who don't talk about what

00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:03,760
they're doing so it's up to us I think

00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:06,369
to educate for the language to promote

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,630
the things that we know that are going

00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:10,000
on in the back rooms of large

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,960
enterprises without naming names the

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,960
Perl is doing yes

00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,329
so the question was is there a way of

00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:37,749
getting the Perl language back into

00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:40,900
academia the short answer is I don't

00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:43,779
know it would be cool if more people in

00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,089
academia were learning you know if

00:36:43,779 --> 00:36:49,569
people were students for learning pearl

00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:50,230
in in the classroom I myself I mean I'm

00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:54,460
a physicist

00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:58,599
I took one Fortran for engineers course

00:36:54,460 --> 00:37:02,829
in 1980 or 81 that's my entire formal

00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:05,319
education in in computing and some of

00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:08,049
the best developers I know in all kinds

00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:09,660
of languages have not learned you know

00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:12,249
through a computing science degree or

00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:14,980
similar so well it would be cool it

00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:17,349
would be nice I'm not sure how

00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,720
fundamentalist let me ask of the people

00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:25,690
in the room how many here took a Perl

00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:27,099
course in in University one two so we're

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,289
doing pretty well without the academics

00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:44,859
and if you know they'll catch up to us

00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:46,900
eventually yes right right yep yeah but

00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:52,420
those five students are very in demand

00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:54,339
today yep and and the people who didn't

00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,920
take it which they did and we'll get

00:37:54,339 --> 00:38:03,099
that message across eventually I think

00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:19,319
yes yeah I saw what I mean I have no

00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:19,319
confirmation bias at all there is

00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:24,670
since I was but maybe COBOL is another

00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,760
Fork

00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:29,530
maybe COBOL will be with us forever this

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,720
belief we have that there's this natural

00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:33,100
growth and decay in languages I think is

00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,260
one that we really have to challenge

00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,730
ourselves on and we just haven't had

00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,040
enough time to see a play out because

00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:42,280
programming is such a young discipline

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,160
but I think it's quite possible that the

00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,570
syntax doesn't decay that these

00:38:45,160 --> 00:39:16,420
languages will be with us potentially

00:38:46,570 --> 00:39:17,530
for a very long time yes yeah in the

00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,480
sense there are more languages on the

00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:22,420
other hand the newbies though the Rubies

00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:25,210
of the world say there are languages to

00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:28,090
pop up and come down again the seas the

00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:30,430
cobol's of fortran's the pearls are at

00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:32,680
this steady level and they may be

00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:35,140
growing but they're they're ubiquitous

00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:39,250
and they're not going away so there is I

00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:40,210
think a space at the top where the or

00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,960
maybe at the bottom where these

00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:46,420
foundational languages lived and there's

00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,250
competition for the space above them in

00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,720
the transient languages and some of

00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,040
those languages may succeed and may

00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,960
ultimately replace one of the

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,860
foundational languages but we haven't

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,200
seen that happen even with COBOL even

00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:01,870
with Fortran right the first compiled

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,120
language is still with us we have one

00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:06,480
minute left so time for one more

00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,480
question

00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:12,210
language the rebrand name is our pearls

00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:14,400
organ pearl 11 organ the answer to get

00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:18,589
Pearl back into academia is to have a

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:22,950
super-duper fast version to use for

00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:33,779
scientist that is one way to do it

00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:35,279
yep not a bad idea at all yes then I

00:40:33,779 --> 00:40:37,650
can't speak too because I have measured

00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:40,170
the general market even then I'm not

00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:42,539
sure it's a bad thing if we grow in

00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:44,519
absolute numbers that's a good thing

00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:46,349
even if even if other things are growing

00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:48,089
faster and that's something that will

00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:49,950
vary over time there will be times I

00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:52,529
think we may be entering one where pearl

00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:54,150
is growing faster than most things

00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:56,460
there'll be other times where we slow

00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:59,279
down and that's natural for any

00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:02,479
technology I think we're out of time

00:40:59,279 --> 00:41:02,479
