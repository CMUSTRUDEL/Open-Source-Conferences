good morning I thank you for coming this

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,759
is a challenging time slot because at

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,610
the same time speaking right now it's

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,100
important cardo morning Steven in yet

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,470
another so thank you for choosing this

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,060
one if you suddenly have discovered that

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,720
I told you you should be somewhere else

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:29,789
you're free to go all right so this is

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,940
part two of this is part 2 of 6 for

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,170
beginners I did part 1 yesterday I how

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,510
many people we're not here for our

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:52,920
conditioning right so to the you

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:54,960
tailslide video ok so now right also for

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,360
those who are getting the live streaming

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,030
or who are giving this on youtube in

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,550
yesterday's patients here to talk to the

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,930
switching to this today we can so now

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:09,960
you have space lights as well alright so

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:19,049
where we go to next is very basic io in

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:21,360
prophase so say is the function that

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,460
Perl 6 introduced and relies on a copy

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,320
in order to be able to write line to

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,750
standard output if you want to go to

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,439
standard error that's just note and that

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,890
will send it to standard error so that's

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,320
the easy way to get output say produces

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,390
something called the gist which is a

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,090
human readable version of whatever it is

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,770
that you're trying to say and different

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,360
objects different types will have

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,399
different ways that they choose to

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,880
represent themselves when they know that

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,590
they are being said that's different

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,150
from print and this is kind of an

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,040
interesting

00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:59,210
differences provides that still the case

00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,430
that criminalizes I've cracked so if you

00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,800
say to print something then you get

00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,420
extremely string representation if you

00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,720
say something you get what's called it

00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,280
jist which is its human readable form

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,420
and those who are not always equivalent

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:20,720
depending on the type really wonderful

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:23,870
for pie safe fun right okay ah a

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,240
convenient way to be able to read a

00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,459
value from standard butter is to use the

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,800
proc pump function so you just a taunt

00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:33,950
you say what you want its profit and

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,720
that will wait for these tenderfoots

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,370
providing line of text and then we will

00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:43,670
try to buy you a new consign somewhere

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:47,060
else so if i go to my I'm here Missy all

00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:51,590
right Raonic this little shorter like it

00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:56,540
so see my color equals from naming their

00:02:51,590 --> 00:03:01,400
color so so to ask in color and I'll

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:05,860
stay purple and so now if I say color it

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,860
comes back mrs. problem any auto choice

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,659
okay if you want to read the entire

00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:22,390
contents of a file then you can do that

00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:26,470
by using dessert from here you just pass

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,870
a funding and it will be back a screen

00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:32,980
which the contents of that entire file

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:36,730
Poland oh my go I you want to be able to

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:39,760
get lines then you can i use the lines

00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:42,609
method or to be able to do that and so

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,299
here you'll get happy okay one or list

00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:47,709
of politicians able to be forever and so

00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:49,690
if you just want to read all the lights

00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,639
and file you can do that we'll talk

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,689
about the tightening that loop here just

00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:58,209
a little bit I got some shortlist spurt

00:03:54,689 --> 00:04:00,819
so if you want to send a big one strain

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,379
of stuff into a file and you don't want

00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,180
to bother with opening the file and

00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:06,069
doing all of those things that you can

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:11,139
do they start to aponte medical center

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:16,269
now alright so that is going to flow

00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:18,039
control in pearl sage to second profile

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,500
we have several operators or the

00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:24,760
different types of comparisons that you

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:27,190
might want to do so even if you don't

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,990
know what kind of operations you have if

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,550
you have other types the operator will

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,409
tell you what kind of comparison they're

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,090
going to perform so the numeric

00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:36,310
operators are just there to straighten

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,889
wants others to their that's actually

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,150
missing the spaceship operator so let me

00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:44,740
just point out

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:48,070
operator so spaceship operator compares

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:52,090
the two elements and we'll give you back

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:55,900
3 is less than 5 or i can say five

00:04:52,090 --> 00:05:02,040
spaceship 0 that tells me that five is

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:02,040
10 or if i have things that are equal

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,880
there are even if it's equal

00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,400
participation in order to now alright

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,740
and so on you'll see that it actually

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,090
comes back to these values less more

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:20,200
insane and those are if we say what are

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:26,050
those actually right so here we knew

00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:29,230
what in then it tells you they're tight

00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,910
border now those are the 501 so you

00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,090
can't still kind of these things same

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:42,820
way to look for the straight version of

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:45,430
the spaceship operator is le g is LEDs

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,920
and the way to think of it is a

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,020
spaceship operator is testing for last

00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,480
minute equality and Griffin all drunks

00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,600
and the leg operator is testing for less

00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,910
than equal even greater than all of us

00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:03,730
that's how we really need these are

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:06,010
going to have this in this plane okay

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,690
pearl is generally fallen view the

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,420
different semantics means you use a

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,710
different operator right and that way

00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,660
you know what the program will do

00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,230
operators are birds even if you don't

00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:20,170
know what the date is right equally

00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:22,480
people always means numeric equality eq

00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,730
always being straight up old plus this

00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,480
edition of air conditioned Tildy is

00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:32,710
concatenated right but in 405 we had

00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,820
other operators that didn't that try to

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,150
be clever they try

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,890
and sometimes that can be confusing so

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,460
for example in pro hi if you said

00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:43,570
reverse on a string then it would change

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,070
the order of characters and

00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,710
strengthening the reversal list would

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:50,710
change the order enlist in Pro 16 now

00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,780
call the strangers my left foot right so

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,250
you put the string and if you're using a

00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,650
clip that means that you're talking

00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,980
about something that is stringing right

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:02,770
so it's going to do a character reversal

00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,560
in that case if you say reverse then it

00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:09,940
assumes you're doing a list right so we

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:13,510
can see you can see that real quick so

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:16,870
if I say eat them back flip right back

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:20,260
is native and if I say one two three

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:23,650
reverse then it reverses the list if I

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:27,460
said once you three flip what am I gonna

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:35,650
get back I'm gonna get string three two

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:38,770
one with spaces so longer list it's a

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:41,440
string because flip coerces whatever it

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,390
is to be a straight just like the equal

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,170
equals operator forces whatever I have

00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:50,550
to be a number right similarly if I said

00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,550
edem not reverse

00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,340
I'm going to get a list containing just

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:01,090
that thing because it acts like a list

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,850
of one so here a flippin reverse flip is

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:06,160
always doing things on strings reverses

00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,660
always doing things on lists and there's

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,130
no floor this mu do these about which

00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:15,610
one you mean similarly with the X and X

00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:17,500
X operators right so the X operator with

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:21,640
the single X means that you're doing the

00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:25,270
string repetition the XX operator always

00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,100
been to doing this car decision so

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,190
there's a lot of things like that in pro

00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,540
6 that have used for a live you know if

00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,760
there was an operator where it could be

00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,680
multiple things that we rename them to

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,450
reading it to make sure that they're

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,070
going to do this is another reason why

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,410
we don't use land for anything it's now

00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:47,440
about cares or gallons or something like

00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:49,480
that okay um for hip statements they're

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,820
the same is what you're used to in

00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,180
profile usually in other languages as

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,760
well you just do hip condition and a

00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,190
block and you can have nelson with a

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,200
condition

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,120
in another walking UK also the block in

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,680
prostate to the parent or of our option

00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,230
you don't have to have the parents

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,660
around them in order to do that they can

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,960
if you want with one caveat that I'll

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,600
show a little bit but they're optional

00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:17,300
and this ends up being the champ can our

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,650
way that most of us right across states

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,350
and I'm writing our conditions we know a

00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,970
lot of the parents there's also no West

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,680
but if you use unless there's no else

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:30,200
unless they're healthsmart so that is

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:33,200
just the single block there is also a

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,200
given win which is pearl sixes version

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,330
of a switch statement but it does a lot

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:45,230
more than just switch between

00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:47,330
alternatives the given when syntax is

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,510
basically given and you have some sort

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:53,210
of value that is your given and what the

00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:55,910
given statement does is it topic Eliza's

00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:58,700
whatever hole isn't working so if I say

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:01,550
given and a value then inside of the

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,200
block that value that was the argument

00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,030
to be given it is now good and all

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,980
around this way it's now the primary

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:11,990
high inside of that walk I can put

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,150
Wednesday Thursday you with any

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,070
statement inside of this given block you

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:21,160
aren't limited to just when statements

00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:25,960
oh and these are like conditionals but

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:30,260
if in a win watch if the initial is true

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:33,100
then it executes the argument blockage

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:36,140
with it and exits the surrounding block

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:39,380
okay so in that statement would not exit

00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,900
but here we go through when we say

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,850
prompt enter a number and then we say

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,880
gift that number I'll explain the start

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,190
of the rule bizim just if that number is

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,490
less than zero we say negative and we

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,670
exit the block if we did thanks in the

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,500
block then we check to see

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,440
number is greater than 0 and if it is we

00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,140
say positive and we've exit the block

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,390
and then for default if we get to this

00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,970
point we do the fall we say 0 and do we

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:09,000
exit the clock so remember yeah we

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:11,400
explore right now in between those one

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,900
statements I can do other tread

00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,230
statements I can do other things as well

00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,090
so when is basically do this test and

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,190
then basis and surrounding block now

00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,440
exit the surrounding rock is a little

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,270
more magical than that it means into the

00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,000
surrounding block that set now are inter

00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,590
store so if you have invested in

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,930
something else it will actually go to

00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:36,630
the block full set of the dollar

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:39,990
underscore to be able to that okay so

00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:42,240
that's given when it's really cool what

00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,550
makes it even cooler is that these

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,210
conditions here are in fact a smart

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:50,310
match now my talk doesn't go through all

00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:53,880
the wonderfulness to destroy matches

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:57,630
incredibly cool feature but you can

00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:01,080
actually do all sorts of tests in this

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:04,140
in that mark like testing for time and

00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:07,050
testing for equality and the specific

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:10,520
value just by putting that is the

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:15,390
argument to lend to let statement right

00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:17,730
yes I think thanks one from the previous

00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:19,529
life why your name's Andy

00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,260
fibers are reasons not to be with the

00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:24,420
same we still see in theatres on health

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,699
yes CF gene does a different type of

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,850
comparison without generic comparison

00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:33,570
with any any type of doc just high and

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:35,490
this one could you alter a good one is

00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,130
this using this mission operators on my

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:45,829
map in those less more same values of

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:49,529
these APIs whooshes have set up Ashton

00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:57,709
that was just let's just see if I can do

00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:57,709
something like that a c6 so

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,990
fault

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:21,639
what I've been saying that sangria

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,589
network right here instead of topical

00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:27,100
izing the number when popular poptropica

00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:32,500
lysing the resultant station and then

00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:37,300
say one less one more patient me inside

00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:39,430
to prompt yes automation possible by

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:43,089
using everyone now remember just you

00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:46,209
know during a half of it was three thank

00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:48,910
you I'm sorry but yeah yeah you did you

00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:53,079
do it that way as well with concept this

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:55,870
devil the speech to me yeah right you

00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:58,240
know given this test and you know every

00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,920
tested 40 but if I was testing for

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,290
something that else like this day right

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,600
what test for content right now this

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,610
case you notice my 33 outlets you

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:13,079
couldn't eat all three reveal the same

00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:19,540
would saying I just did good personal um

00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:21,519
okay if I was being really haha really

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,620
you know paranoid as i can write it this

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,050
way because i say default have because i

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:29,410
don't know the spaceship operator will

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:32,769
always give me less more per se I kind

00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:36,250
of know for these two values it could

00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:38,769
give you like I could get a failure I

00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:41,970
could yet it could have been overloaded

00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:45,279
with another meaning by somebody else

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:48,639
alright so you know I wanted to be used

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:51,189
a little bit more I in prospects I

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,040
always worry about when people say you

00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:56,699
know such and such because I know that

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,699
you don't know

00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:04,649
as there because there are so many ways

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,670
that the language can be changed mutated

00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:09,990
now I discovered that's the point 06 but

00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,519
there are times when you don't go with a

00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:15,690
different operator it would be somewhere

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:18,690
in Calvert lexical scope and and where I

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,430
learned that in my pingu case was in

00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,959
dealing with inheritance for regular

00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:24,389
expressions because regular expressions

00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,220
are done with methods and you know we

00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:28,050
often look at regular expression which

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,639
ends up becoming the method call and

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,860
everybody says we you can optimize this

00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,540
because you know a little claw and the

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,660
answer is no as soon as somebody drives

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,660
a new grammar I don't know and so that's

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,550
a there's a lot of stuff that's anyway

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:47,399
thanks it oh thank you get to the stars

00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:49,560
so that star is called Blair that that

00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:53,190
is its name it's whatever and it's used

00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:55,860
as a placeholder when you want to have

00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:58,190
some witness and want the compiler to

00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,769
figure out whatever it is that we need

00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:05,579
so in this case of the scar ends up

00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:07,410
becoming the topic says give me prompt

00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:09,209
and when whatever it is is less than

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,839
zero when whatever it is greater than

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:15,420
zero and so forth and that started to

00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,769
used a lot of different places oh good I

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,699
said I wouldn't be too much cool stuff

00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:24,420
but I'm going to do this to try to give

00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:27,209
an idea so if we wanted to get an

00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:32,510
element from the end of the right right

00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:34,560
so x equals that this is do 15 like so

00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:39,600
actually the students and

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,220
Apple open in generating right so i have

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,980
this let's say I'm gonna get the last

00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:48,200
element from the array then way to do

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:51,839
that is to say a whatever minus one

00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:54,060
right and that whatever there is place

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,950
holder that says well what would we

00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,680
naturally think of as being here it's

00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,830
the length of the array and so it tells

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,709
me give me the elementary at the

00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:07,500
position you know in this case 4-1 so

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:10,290
that would give me the first middle

00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,589
grade and I see Dave but we're not

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:15,750
limited to just doing the minus line

00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:20,160
there will be pushing other elements

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:22,620
onto that so that's what screw so now we

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,199
can see that acts like a has happened

00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:29,089
there so I even do things like say give

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,089
me the government is in the middle right

00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:39,870
so that's what ever the length of the

00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:42,360
array is I do i do and you can do even

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,760
bigger map and stuff like that to be

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,470
able to consider so this star has to be

00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,040
taking the sea views in different places

00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:52,560
that whatever we just once and put we

00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,540
needed something there and let the Pearl

00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,980
to figure out for us then whatever is

00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:00,380
good it's also used for infinity so

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,140
actually i'll do that will be changes

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,610
you

00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,610
the marvel

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:18,350
I hope this is a great way to be no

00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,390
current scars oh it's a range about to

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:27,210
the end so yeah it's doing exactly what

00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:29,940
you asked oh yeah it is I should have a

00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:33,750
message yes but it is but that Casey's

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:35,900
feel air guitar he's ever cheated ready

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,040
yeah I used to do this contextual

00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:46,620
whatever you're passing the star too

00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:50,580
besides what is media is so so I can do

00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:57,420
can I was work everything bought the

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:59,850
last report there yet everything about

00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:03,510
the last moment so to to read that sorry

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:06,090
I just one guess mean the length of the

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:08,640
array minus one right and then the up to

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:11,010
operator says give you a range going

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,290
from that to the thing for it and so

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,000
that's everything except for the last

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:18,240
element which looks kind of nice is it

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:24,960
or not so if you want you really do care

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:29,670
start off back here sorry I saw me try

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,460
it try to visit right report not yes so

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:35,520
what's the distinction there between

00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:37,680
star minus one and just star in one case

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,130
it means the length of the array and

00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,420
cool greatly right that's correct okay

00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,150
urging that the whether you're buying a

00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,530
particular know whether yes the minus

00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:51,130
knows to do something different with

00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:53,050
this Martin the array subscripts the

00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:55,420
intuition what's getting the star is the

00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:58,360
earth it's actually a way of writing can

00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,160
sign up something and it's not just in

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,990
the subscript it says oh this is a

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,400
function i will call it the flood last

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:09,310
argument but if you call it the first

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,950
are the subscript says oh they call them

00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:14,770
to the bear start they wanted it ok so

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:24,340
it really does mean whatever in context

00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:27,490
to what are you have to yes yeah it says

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:32,100
no to that so if you use a bear

00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,100
subscript then I do now get a

00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:40,990
discontinuity

00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:45,670
right right um so then you know so then

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:47,320
the question becomes often what I would

00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,910
do probably not the best programming

00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,800
practice but you know if you just quit

00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,870
index crack words that you actually add

00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,640
you know looking around your brains do

00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:57,160
you do modulo arithmetic and easy

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,230
realities for soccer sent yeah you can

00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,120
you start right here oh whatever

00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:03,040
something's right for sex talk right

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,960
yeah so there's a lot of things that you

00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,730
can do where if just means you don't

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,970
have to take a lot of stuff so you'll

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:14,410
see a lot of I our skin in Perl 6 which

00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:16,360
is our yahya john clutter all right okay

00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:19,060
the loop statement is for writing an

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:22,390
infinite loop until you just say look

00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,490
and put there and it does forever and if

00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,290
you're really old school UIC style loops

00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,240
then that's the way you do it with the

00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,710
loop statement as well you put parents

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,840
and then you can have the initializer

00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:36,670
part the testing part conditional and

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:40,570
then the negative report while loop is

00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:42,640
pretty much as we've all confused too so

00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:45,640
too I out conditional block with

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,030
whatever you want to have done there's

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,820
also until which is the same as while

00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:53,560
but it reverses the sense of the test so

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,420
while just something as long as

00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,160
something's true and until there's

00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,920
something as well those things as long

00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,590
as the pulse there are also do forms of

00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,710
these so that there's a repeat routine

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:13,030
writing to you can say repeat block wild

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:18,730
hola and repeat until the stars the star

00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:20,140
envy sense within this loops loops on go

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:24,910
bust our

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:29,500
and correct correct it was repeating

00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:32,020
choir Peter wider yes yes though you

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:35,650
can't really place to be conditional

00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:37,660
love to the front drink I'll save you

00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:41,020
you can't save our meanwhile whatever

00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:47,460
inventive luck and as always this is

00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:53,320
okay and those are the tests yes we did

00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:55,420
traditional parents yes yes yeah yeah

00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,950
pal appearances though it's the one

00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,870
place where you have to have parents or

00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:09,160
initials it is more than just one

00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:11,620
national we could advise it but and

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,390
claritin budget in devotion there will

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:20,170
be modulus to budget it will not go to

00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:23,970
recruit we're actually want to

00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:27,730
discourage it exactly exactly all right

00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:31,900
now you can do 20 lakhs with while and

00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:33,580
if and these other things and so what

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,690
happens is so we've enjoyed watch you

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,490
give you twenty bucks and I'll talk a

00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,190
little bit more about twenty bucks they

00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:41,440
love it but this says while it prompts

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,480
of Allah Allah and the 20 baht the

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,610
pointy arrow there says take whatever

00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,970
the value of this test was and stick it

00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:51,700
in a variable colon dollar tea and so

00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:53,620
this simultaneously gets the prompt and

00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,780
then inside the block associates it with

00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,820
this variable poverty so you don't have

00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,650
to do a lot of mind whatever you have to

00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,660
do assignment within a while you can

00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,960
just do it and it still does all the

00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:07,679
testing that you can come if you would

00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:11,920
sony could fake box like robots

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,390
and it's the actual value before play it

00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,140
might have been done telephone game

00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:18,730
universe but it gives you it gives you

00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,809
what came back from here not its

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:25,090
luminous so if you did until it would

00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:28,900
probably fail it'll probably never end

00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:32,670
of the block now that's what ever you

00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,670
enter as opposed to the industry

00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:56,259
then or something easy yes other way

00:24:52,289 --> 00:25:02,039
though because it was true instantly

00:24:56,259 --> 00:25:05,039
make it gladly haha do that signal feet

00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:05,039
even

00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:19,980
so it didn't say it didn't say that's

00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,490
where it sent you because it wasn't

00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:26,160
actually yeah and now it's doing the

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:29,040
until and so many times I they get it

00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,990
will spill stuff all right let's go yeah

00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:36,180
let's go do weird cases like that all

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:38,100
right let's get the try can see first

00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,220
the size of you have one of the things

00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,690
if you want to go back and do this again

00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:45,030
okay and there's the for loop to the for

00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:48,240
loop this is the way to do Federation in

00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:50,340
process and you can use it to iterate

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,870
over anything that makes sense carry

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,580
over and you can use at a rate things

00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:56,250
developing sensitive in right over able

00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,590
to its best right so the canonical form

00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:01,560
for iterating over an array is something

00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:04,950
like this I would say for your rating

00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:07,500
assigned tasks you do the arrow you say

00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:09,960
what you want the value to be stored in

00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,660
the inside of the block and then you

00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,520
have a lock and you can go and do

00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,800
whatever you know you want to do within

00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,420
that block if you don't have a pointy

00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,460
walk there if you just put a bear walk

00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,100
without that then it will of course

00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,770
wanted all my other store just like

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:28,260
we're all used to but the arrow pointing

00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:31,140
block is a way of being able to say what

00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:35,760
we want the iterator variable to be

00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:39,900
inside of the former okay so very very

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:42,300
handy ranges are also very proud of a

00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,030
little move over arranged and for those

00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:47,010
of us who like to have code

00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:49,410
they somewhat self-documenting it's real

00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,300
pain to say you know do something from

00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:54,090
06 from what I'm really trying to say to

00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,760
you something because the number seven

00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:58,080
doesn't appear there anywhere and so

00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,840
then you get around that you can say oh

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,450
well this new things you know from zero

00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:07,530
to seven minus one which really looks

00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:10,170
ugly as well the range operator is

00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:13,110
really nice with the half this means do

00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:15,980
something this is saying out of seven

00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:19,260
times dr. Lena produces a range from 06

00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:23,970
do I have yeah here it is so here ranges

00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:26,070
in 406 right so range is another type

00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,260
and then six if you use the two dots

00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,820
than your gramma cash and you're

00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:33,390
creating a range between a pair of

00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:38,850
numbers and they implement my water and

00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:42,300
astoria right oh yes well it said it

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:44,880
must finish and also very really artists

00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:48,870
intervals right test against them you

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,370
can match 1.5 so some correct they are

00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:53,130
not they are not get it rearranges

00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:57,300
except we must use the vicinity what a

00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:59,190
practicing so um if I have a range like

00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,040
when we fly and I say what is that its

00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,890
range this is a type just like hair was

00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,280
a type when we were talking about

00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:13,310
go into ashes and I get aside arranged

00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:16,430
to a variable right and so you'll notice

00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:18,320
that is scalar and i find it arranged

00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:20,330
and if i say what's in that scalar it's

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,090
actually a good range that's a single

00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:25,960
object it is not the values blow 2 3 4 5

00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:30,140
that's because that expansion comes a

00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:32,060
Defen you have a person or 12 is it do

00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:39,080
the parentheses also create this objects

00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:40,880
no no no no common stock correct and to

00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,770
bear here in screen into his work yes

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,310
but yeah her parents are novice

00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:48,500
constructors common service concerns I

00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:50,330
just did the invite said say one def I

00:28:48,500 --> 00:29:02,420
find out what forgot what lines ready

00:28:50,330 --> 00:29:05,780
for the range in so yeah alright so so

00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:08,570
ranges are you no first class types in

00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:11,600
pro 6 and that means a number of

00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:13,730
different things one of those that you

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,200
can smart match against them so if we

00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:18,170
want to test if the number is inside a

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:22,760
certain range then I can say is three in

00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:24,710
the range 0 to 10 like so and will come

00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,770
out and say true and it didn't actually

00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:30,200
have to do the expansion of 0 God

00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:33,620
attended determine them back if I say is

00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:36,770
we got high in the range of 0-10

00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:38,480
complex's true even though if I were to

00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:41,600
expand that range in the list

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,820
literatures 3.5 it exists in there right

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,410
oh that's what we need my ranges are

00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:50,440
continuous there are also importance of

00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:53,950
the range operator good or

00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,899
this is an exclusive so 1 by x 10 means

00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:59,080
the range from 1 to 10 including one in

00:29:55,899 --> 00:30:01,120
10 but if you put out of the carrots on

00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,149
the other side Ranger operators you're

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:08,440
saying exclude that endpoint term range

00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:11,769
so when Cara got five means one but not

00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,590
including one up to five and whatnot

00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:17,679
carrot drive means one occupy the

00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:22,179
concluding five and if you do that thing

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,799
in the middle or the cat ears then that

00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:26,169
means the range of one to five not

00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:28,720
including 15 and I guess continuous so

00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:31,929
one point one is in this range even

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,090
though one point though is not and then

00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:37,029
we have our shortcut notation the carrot

00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:39,549
5 which is the same thing as zero carrot

00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:43,149
five which means everything up zero up

00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:48,419
to five and there's type of those items

00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:48,419
in here I should be 0 1 2 3 4

00:30:51,090 --> 00:31:02,919
apparently not cheap altitude well it's

00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:07,600
the range from 0 to the fio2 one is the

00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:12,730
three hi baby anyway they were gonna

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:15,190
Jonathan in science all right the really

00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:16,720
nice thing about the 20 blocks and taxes

00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:20,100
that you aren't limited to having just

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,799
one iterator you can have multiple and

00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:26,260
so if you put multiple variables after

00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:28,780
the arrow then that means take n at a

00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:33,040
time from the list instead of taking one

00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:37,059
at a time so in this case um I have set

00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:40,030
of capitals here which is key UK value

00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:41,679
London p Slovakia value brush law and I

00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,809
believe Katie on them that gives me a

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,500
list and that this is going to be key

00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:54,250
value keynote it's Latin right so let's

00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:56,549
just just put this inside and out of

00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,549
here

00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:10,050
no it's a little time yeah perl 6 you

00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:12,150
don't need find some progress in the

00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,530
pilot knows the thing on the left hand

00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:16,850
side is a list so it treats the

00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:21,210
right-hand side as almost all right okay

00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:25,170
and so if i say what is ke for this

00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:27,930
you'll see that it gives me smooth as

00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:30,870
well here the steam that when i get back

00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:33,330
is slovakia box lava UK one and that's

00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:35,310
my list right and if I'm going to get

00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,930
irate over those I don't want to take

00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:39,780
them I want to go to take them to the

00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:43,470
time and so by then it this way i can

00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:45,690
say apples katie and put the first thing

00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,700
that I get the list in the country same

00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:50,130
thing that I get in the city going to

00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,540
the loop go back up to the top the next

00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:53,130
thing that I get the country the next

00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,770
thing in the city you are new loop so

00:32:53,130 --> 00:33:01,280
it's always grabbing them two at a time

00:32:54,770 --> 00:33:01,280
to be able graphics um yes what I have

00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:10,020
because katie is producing something

00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:14,250
that is illness that's that you can all

00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:18,600
agree plot thread right perhaps modified

00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:25,920
ashley reed you don't wanna do that I

00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:28,520
said try and see but my initial compiler

00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:32,250
language person is it's undefined

00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:34,380
including the way it's undefined right

00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:37,040
until until somebody wants to be in the

00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,040
spectrum where

00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:52,799
there was no reason for that other than

00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:54,270
my figures head to quotes because I

00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,580
sometimes working languages where the

00:33:54,270 --> 00:34:00,900
fat arrow doesn't hotter quote the thing

00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:04,169
in the live there fat girls the only

00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:06,360
place auditory in process right but

00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:08,990
sometimes I just do it out of habit I

00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,609
didn't want to max missing all right um

00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:13,770
what's really nice and I use this fair

00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:15,960
bit is that you can use this Katie

00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:18,419
method on a race as well and when

00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,190
Edwards what it does is it gives you the

00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:24,240
index for the elements followed by the

00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:26,639
actual element for the array and you can

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,200
then break out so that you have the

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,720
index of the element in this case

00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,760
visited afternoon and the value of the

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,220
elevators in the duct task and so now

00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,349
you know for every iteration through the

00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:39,570
loop what the value was in the array but

00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:41,159
you also know where it was so we don't

00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:47,070
have any magical variable it gives you

00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:49,409
the current context of a loop so that's

00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:55,169
just uh i think i have my another day

00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:58,000
here today they said okay this if we on

00:34:55,169 --> 00:35:01,720
find if you up at pier right

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
not a business or is that more like here

00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,040
you are injured Nexus second actually

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,720
say what you're really doing the top kds

00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,520
are computed producing an iteration

00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,230
which is the set of elements so if you

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:17,650
edit the array I don't know what that

00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:20,890
does to the iteration that I will never

00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:28,840
work in front of do probably reserve the

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:31,020
right to change of director is very

00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,090
short

00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:36,900
just for you to exist does not others

00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:39,690
just for so I asked for a top kv you'll

00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:44,490
see I get the indices and things and so

00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:50,640
I can do through it or a KB into our key

00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:54,480
and I tend to do just key eval you so

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:59,850
and you can see I get the indexes and

00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:03,420
values very very easily that one all

00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:04,980
right um so you can take two or three or

00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,600
more then of course the question becomes

00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,450
well what happens if you're taking two

00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:12,750
at a time and you pass it and list with

00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,370
a lot number of elements right and the

00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,310
answer is is that on that last iteration

00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:18,810
you'll get an error because it will say

00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,870
I need two elements and there's only one

00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:31,470
there and it won't actually work so let

00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:41,550
me come or this could hear Jane gentle

00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:44,390
Johnny Jimmy you have to pay stop I and

00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:50,010
I'm just going to be the odd over here

00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:52,800
or dancers pick ok so what it could do

00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:57,920
so pickable picked a random thing out of

00:36:52,800 --> 00:37:02,160
sequence right so if I just say answers

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:07,170
take then it will pick one out again can

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:09,390
I don't you okay but okay but if I say

00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:11,640
pick three things at random out of the

00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,770
list then it will pick three things but

00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:17,070
never the same thing twice wreath with

00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:18,750
removal in that right good so it doesn't

00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:22,800
change the value cancers it gives me

00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:24,390
list where I think three right um if I

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,370
want to pick and I just want to shuffle

00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,160
everything up all of the dancers to be

00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:30,400
picked in summary

00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:33,130
order that's where we use the star right

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,810
so this is pick out a list of the

00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:39,430
dancers and every time I read this I'll

00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:41,980
get a different sequence right not with

00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:49,450
replacement of herbs Global's that pic

00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:53,290
as it does so if i'm going to do like

00:37:49,450 --> 00:38:09,430
the standard monday at six roller roller

00:37:53,290 --> 00:38:12,880
a nice once ok so here I'm only a six

00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:16,840
sided die right I don't roll it if I'm

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:20,260
going to roll it three times I want to

00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:23,860
rise 8 times 8 times that's what we mean

00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:27,370
by with replacement you know if I save

00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:34,420
pics eight times it can only pick each

00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:37,000
number wats part ok he said the place

00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:43,090
until I see the best actor backpack yeah

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,470
yeah so anyway so roll you know I can go

00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:50,340
through and same hole device and other

00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:58,120
times and they will do the big dasa game

00:38:50,340 --> 00:39:00,190
right so if i go back to my dancers and

00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,770
i say give me a hand seat with some

00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:05,380
dancers right so if i want to randomly

00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:08,680
parodies out with my for loop then i can

00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:10,900
do something like this for dancers in

00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,910
some sequence give me one dancer and

00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,740
another dancer and say these to dance

00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:15,640
together but i have a lot of the road

00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:24,540
answers that I

00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:24,540
and up there then I found e1 and e2 here

00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,140
so here we see the Jill dances with Jane

00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:41,000
Johnny dances with Jenny and somebody

00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:43,910
got left out yes to bring anything

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,720
inside oh wait what if you want to rush

00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:48,980
enjoy yourself then there's not

00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:59,720
sufficient information in this

00:39:48,980 --> 00:40:03,350
particular model okay so yes is that a

00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:08,440
fatal for of that of the closest table

00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:16,060
avail so you can't great soul basil

00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:16,060
folks hazel as I said I okay stop

00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:28,450
or do that by fixing to you all right ok

00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:31,660
so this arrow notation that we see here

00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:34,240
is actually a general-purpose thing it's

00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:37,900
not hard for statement it's not part of

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,670
the plastic right it's actually just a

00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,040
place where wherever we put a block we

00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,900
can pretty much go to pointy lock all

00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,310
right and appointing lock is just

00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,080
introduced by the arrow which is a

00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,700
hyphen full of a great design and then

00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:52,540
after that you can put very good things

00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:54,640
and so forth and if you do that you get

00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,900
a probable piece of code but that

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,330
callable piece of cuddling has

00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,830
parameters and so what you're doing is

00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,450
you're saying I want to have a code

00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:04,120
block but I wanted to have these two

00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:05,860
parameters and so when it's called it

00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,050
expects to have that number of arguments

00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:10,960
that go into the block and then it will

00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:13,510
assign them for lineman into the

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,610
parameters so in this particular example

00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:19,410
we have a scalar variable and we're

00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:21,850
setting it to be equal to this point one

00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:24,040
right so that'll become something that

00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,750
we can call and then later in our

00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,820
program we could say yellow st. Peter

00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,410
which is our 20 block and we can use the

00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:32,890
parentheses which means we want you to

00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:35,380
Bogut and we pass the arguments and so

00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:38,320
on in this case that hej which is

00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:40,510
probably someone which video club it was

00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,110
in a greeting and roll music name and we

00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:46,690
are saying the greeting comment and make

00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:48,250
right so 40 blocks are like sobs they're

00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:52,900
not subs and then you can give a

00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:55,900
parameters right and so of course we can

00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:58,270
just do the same thing this up so the

00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,040
way to declare sub and pro 6 is you kind

00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:02,470
of Hubert's up and you follow that with

00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:06,040
the name of the sub and if you like and

00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:08,290
believe me but you can use bread

00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,210
and you can name the parameters of the

00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:13,480
sub and these the things that will

00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:15,160
receive arguments for that sup so this

00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,280
is drunk eight and we'll have one

00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,530
parameter which is called text and then

00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,540
we'll go through and execute this

00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:24,220
particular block of text in this case

00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,070
we're checking to see if text has more

00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:28,900
than 100 characters and if so we will do

00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:31,210
a substrate in the first 10 call without

00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,620
the hot and if it does not have one that

00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:34,990
I'm every character so we just return

00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:40,360
the full text it's a truncation in case

00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:42,790
is really John right all right so the

00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:46,390
question question bang bang is the new

00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:50,200
version of the ternary operator so

00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:52,780
question colon in 405 NC and lots of

00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:58,320
Atlantis as you know question rushing in

00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:58,320
colon colon in Perl 6 I really like this

00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:05,890
you said home I'm sorry paying right I'm

00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:07,780
sorry I really like this because first

00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:10,360
of all if you were in yesterday's

00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:12,910
session that I did the ? always means

00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:15,010
these they're true and the ! these

00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:17,020
things that are false so this pedes

00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,550
check to see if text up here see greater

00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,340
than have your gift through this if

00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:23,260
false do that the other thing is that

00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,880
they're double just like the other short

00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,830
circuiting things where you do one thing

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,080
or another like the double vertical

00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,550
pipes in the double ampersand they're

00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,630
definitely just like that to say there's

00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:35,890
a short circuit

00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:39,760
play some code that's option right up so

00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:42,070
I really like what you declare sub you

00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,690
can then call it and you would call it

00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:45,130
the way of inspect so they look so

00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:47,110
apparent or whatever argument you want

00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:49,870
to pass or if you don't like doing the

00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:51,820
parents who can do the name of the sub

00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:54,010
and pass whatever because you look there

00:43:51,820 --> 00:44:08,830
they're slightly different but pretty

00:43:54,010 --> 00:44:19,020
much to say yes even cleared so many of

00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:21,280
space you can say correct that's why

00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:24,340
you're correct your head me which

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:28,210
escaped alright so there are a couple

00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:30,400
rules about calls justice question to go

00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:32,830
ahead with the money blossom they have

00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,480
named primary position they kind of a

00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:36,370
members if I can see that in just a

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,920
second if i have time to mattituck

00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:41,530
alright so there's a couple of very

00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:45,010
consistent rules battle Carson or if you

00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:47,170
have a bear work or the name and it's

00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:50,050
followed immediately by apparent then

00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:52,390
you are making a function home okay

00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:57,820
doesn't matter if that bearer is a key

00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:59,320
word right so if I see if animare and

00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:04,090
immediately after I'm calling a

00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:06,700
subroutine called if so if somebody

00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:11,100
declare subroutine colleges and that's

00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:11,100
the little bit get it looked interface

00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,530
right so anytime that you have a

00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:20,220
bareword followed immediately by a

00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:25,400
parent that means is a summer she call

00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:28,800
all right so it even beats keywords and

00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:31,680
you can even see that here if I say if 3

00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:35,220
greater than 5 and do something that

00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:39,990
probably do that right there right it

00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:42,450
will tell me undeclared routine if all

00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:44,369
right the other rule is that if you have

00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:46,650
supper tuning and you followed by white

00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:49,470
space then you are passing a list of

00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:51,030
arguments and the parents if you have

00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:55,920
them are the first and that was two

00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:58,260
arguments right so here if I say

00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,359
substrate craft one then substrate is

00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,030
being called with two arguments craft

00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:05,430
and lunch if I say substrate with a

00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:07,800
space craft in one boot and substrate is

00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,690
being home with one argument that one

00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,480
argument happens to be a list of two

00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:14,400
things right so you can't just

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,840
arbitrarily space your arrangements out

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:22,410
and have parents it's different from the

00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:25,050
profile that way that the halter so you

00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:27,300
have to you kind of any time you put a

00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:30,030
parent after this then you are always

00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,980
getting a 17 hole and any time you put a

00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:35,609
space back here getting some colleges

00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:41,210
always paint costs past as a list it was

00:46:35,609 --> 00:46:43,330
looking for once or be earning those yes

00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:47,180
yes

00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:56,540
actually more general read post pics

00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:58,250
operator okay so in the trunk a sub that

00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,960
we had earlier you'll notice there was

00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,630
no return statement the last thing that

00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,190
is executed ends up being the return

00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:07,340
value of the sub you can be explicit

00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:09,800
about at the same turn return of course

00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:11,120
is an exception basically it interrupts

00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,340
flow control so if you knew it the

00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,410
middle of subroutine then it will return

00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:20,830
now to the middle 17 not going to the

00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:23,690
end so it changes the flow control

00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:26,480
return of only works inside of subs or

00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:29,360
things declared with a sub or method for

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,210
one of those keywords inside of a pointy

00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:34,400
block if you say return inside of a

00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:35,720
21-20 lot is a block so you can say

00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,000
return out of it then you're actually

00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:47,210
returning out whatever sub or routine

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:50,300
contained the pointy block right um in

00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:51,770
the previous example we had been doing a

00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:54,980
just passing scale urge that you can

00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:58,790
pass raise and hashes just like passing

00:47:54,980 --> 00:48:00,380
scale about this one minute guide and so

00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,850
here you can see that I have some

00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:07,730
routine name from shortest and it will

00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:09,080
take two arrays as arguments and unlike

00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:10,910
in profile where they all end up

00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,080
platinum you have to do references and

00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:15,170
things like that doesn't happen in real

00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,940
things right so I'll be able to pass two

00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:19,390
arguments to join the shortest as long

00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,390
as they are

00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:27,290
novo terminology which is really useful

00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:29,600
to know especially as you're reading

00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:31,400
argumentation we try to be very

00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,760
consistent about these two words

00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:36,380
arguments and parameter argument is the

00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,020
thing that we pass kinda making a

00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:42,260
subpoena color value or whatever it is

00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:44,840
for passing lincoln center can bring the

00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:47,930
parameter is whatever you call it when

00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,840
you receive it inside of the 17 so 17

00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:51,920
definition defines the parameters

00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,840
subroutine call said what are being

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,370
passive square roots we trying to be

00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,380
pretty consistent when we do this in

00:48:55,370 --> 00:49:03,200
documentation and bass communicating

00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:04,400
what makes a lot easier ok just because

00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,860
I wanted to be sure that you ran this

00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,420
question for Hannah no time if you put a

00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:12,590
question mark mark parameter that makes

00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:14,870
an and so in our case where we

00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:18,050
have odd number of dancers we can say

00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:20,030
dancers that pic and we take the first

00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:21,710
one and put it in the first then we take

00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:24,170
the second one yet there is one and put

00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:25,730
it into seventh and there's not one the

00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:30,590
list is run out at a particular point

00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:33,830
then it would get the value nailed know

00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:41,870
then you know it would turn into any can

00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:44,570
we get in right so here we can say if

00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:45,890
second if you got an actual value for

00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:47,510
second so we could say first chance to

00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:51,260
the second otherwise you can stay first

00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:54,010
answer by commercial you can also do a

00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:58,640
default so if you could an equal sign

00:49:54,010 --> 00:50:00,290
after typing right then that says we use

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,360
whatever value whatever argument is

00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:03,740
supplied if we get it but if we didn't

00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:06,320
get an argument for that particular spot

00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:09,770
then we will use this particular value

00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:11,360
done okay right and that works in 20

00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:15,430
blocks of words anywhere where we're

00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:19,150
setting up a list of parameters right

00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:22,000
slightly one thing I didn't get to which

00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:24,670
I was point2 because I've done is they

00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,050
are you messin parameters so why would

00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:27,609
you have positional parameters which is

00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:29,410
the lungs that we've been doing you can

00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:32,020
also do named parameters by putting the

00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:36,160
colon in front and that means that you

00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:37,839
can pass those arguments by name so here

00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,760
this is truncate it takes a single

00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:41,829
positional or you spelled text that's

00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,720
required and then it has two optional

00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:45,730
name are twins let's hold them in on one

00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,130
small trailer and so when you call that

00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:50,109
maybe say here's my text that I want to

00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:53,040
truncate and ivan said the value of

00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:55,630
limit to be 11 and that will go in depth

00:50:53,040 --> 00:51:00,940
if I wanted to set trailer that I could

00:50:55,630 --> 00:51:05,260
say trailer pointy arrow and let's get

00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:07,809
that so that's part of me out if you

00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:09,940
want to go further there are several

00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:12,339
places as you can go so the primary

00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:13,780
source for perl 6 documentation and the

00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:16,809
oaks who are working on this are

00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:19,599
astounding I mean multiple commits per

00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:23,770
day to the doctor cockerel six that work

00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:25,720
they are really fleshing out the entire

00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:29,950
documentation and I'm not going to

00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:31,750
feature two thousand other so the go to

00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:34,030
dhaka pro stick that already is really

00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:36,010
nice it's very searchable for being into

00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:37,869
certain key words of classes it shows

00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:39,460
you classifier it means there's a lot of

00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:41,770
stuff like that there are examples that

00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:43,480
example several states I learn the more

00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:46,809
links for documentation and prostate

00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,670
federal / documentation if you are

00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:52,690
really lost you want help then go to

00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:54,089
pearl safes um I know that Disneyland is

00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:57,010
often called the happiest place on earth

00:51:54,089 --> 00:52:00,819
I think that roast is probably the

00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:02,920
friendliest place on IRC so if you want

00:52:00,819 --> 00:52:05,230
to get help if you have an idea they can

00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,119
go there you ask a question usually when

00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:10,630
somebody will be more than glad to

00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:12,160
mentor or drag you through or to gently

00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:14,349
tell you Bible or things like that

00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,390
they're really really good there's also

00:52:14,349 --> 00:52:18,630
a prostitution shamelessness thank you

00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,630
very much
