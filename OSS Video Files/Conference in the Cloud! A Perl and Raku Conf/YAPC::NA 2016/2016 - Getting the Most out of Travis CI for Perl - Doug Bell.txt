alright this is Tom pilots getting home

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:18,090
side of using Travis is any here /

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:21,420
Houston offense country so Travis CI is

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,449
a continuous integration server if you

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,050
don't whisper haps Jenkins it wats the

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:34,010
other continuous integration okay thank

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:37,500
you so continuous integration testing

00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:41,730
but the idea behind continuous is that

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,980
it tests every single change some people

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,100
shipments up to your server your CI

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:51,930
server will see that commit run your

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:55,020
tests Patel you out of it Travis CI is

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,960
specifically for it up so you better go

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,120
up on github you can use Java Sea I and

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,290
if you're using give up three you can

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:10,200
use your FC at work so there's really no

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:12,299
excuse not to business and I'm going to

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,659
show you how to get our release Lee to

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,390
have you listened to you to configure

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,450
Travis we've got a small configuration

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,580
file now tribes a camel so it's going to

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,760
be hidden

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:31,090
and the basic default configuration all

00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:34,840
you need is these lines we're go through

00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,760
Phoenicians once we do is if you want to

00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,729
step get started using Travis and how

00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,070
bean paste this into your repository and

00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:46,000
Travis will start asking for a

00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:48,850
repository so turned up we've got a

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,220
language travesty guys sports object

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:56,200
languages we're going to each borough so

00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:58,650
we just have say and then we can divide

00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,210
which versions of girl you want to test

00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,300
so previously and they had said we want

00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:07,270
to test 16 18 20 that's how this

00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:10,780
presentation is updated with 22 info for

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:13,330
you so we can say that I want to test

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:17,560
just I've got 20 and this will give me a

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:22,120
prebuilt I've got 20 version really my

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:25,600
traps so this actually includes some

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,110
modules and some such that that Travis

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:32,500
provides for us the problem here is that

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,090
it can contain on core modules so one of

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,040
the things I'm use Travis for is

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,080
ensuring that i specify my tendencies

00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,080
correctly and as long as

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,120
a bit by not suspecting that not specify

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,810
dependency the Travis unfortunately

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:51,230
already Hammond this is for performance

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,720
because there is a time limit Travis

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,160
being freed and being a shared resource

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,040
there's only a college you can use it

00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,780
and then it currently is convince your

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,780
tire will takes more than that peanuts

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:09,350
that's what we want we can actually

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,880
specify a third version number this will

00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:15,830
be as a cleaning rebuilt or only pearl

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,230
so I use this a one of my bills to

00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,540
ensure that I get only core modules with

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:24,410
that version of Perl and to test to make

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:26,980
sure i got my fantasies correct getting

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:31,410
yes so you're saying that the extra

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:34,810
Empire will make sure that you know

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,520
right so this basically it's if I only

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,520
put five that honey I really don't care

00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,720
about that when you get and Travis is

00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,640
going to get they speak the most

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,750
efficient 525 but why go the further to

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,470
say that I suppose if you want

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,960
testimonial on Travis well specifically

00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,270
the traps helpers are going to grab a

00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:00,970
prebuilt by Muriel just that it just

00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:08,170
before I'll show examples of traps files

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:10,140
and explain which which is so dr.

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,690
modules using these lights or build

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,970
genes can if you're you've got billions

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:19,600
and going to tasks that can create

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:23,430
problem you can specify whether you want

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,630
to April with or without threading and

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:29,320
you can certify you want the latest deaf

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:32,980
girl that we about 25 at zero currently

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,590
believe and finally you can also

00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:39,070
specified one place bleed and this will

00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:42,190
build from the real git repository it

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:46,990
will build a girl and I'd runner runner

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:50,020
texts so this is helpful to have kind of

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:53,760
as a willing to do a lot of fail but

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:58,080
it's kind of nice to have now

00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:01,860
voters later the next slide we disabled

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,730
pseudo and also dumper speed because if

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,980
we want to Travis billed as a container

00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:10,500
it allows us to us all never saw a lot

00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,390
into it for example if our tests require

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,850
your host grass or my second thing or

00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:18,800
both or neither that we can install

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:21,330
those and our testing us live database

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,140
the container that they currently use my

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,790
fault is this level of gluten you can

00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:31,070
actually specify different versions of

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,820
them to paying a chance to test iOS 10

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,410
unfortunately the film video is

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:39,150
available there is something else so

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:43,560
it's the name escapes me I don't believe

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:47,460
so the slightest talking available all

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,220
those things are links so be able to go

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,840
through the sides and to actually really

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,840
infection and I have time

00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:00,520
so we say explicitly pseudo means it

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,910
means they can just take a container

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,380
throw out there being we started to run

00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,670
your thing and then they don't have to

00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:11,290
clean up how they can reuse that out

00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:13,060
there but if you use so no capacity you

00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:18,130
can stop your erection you have to get

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:21,070
this all started Eugene an apartment

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:25,060
that last line was where it's all and it

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:28,960
did this this is the Travis parole

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:32,650
colors you can written by Grant note and

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:37,600
they own that to build any sequence ID

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:40,240
eldest and that runs the taxes so when

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,720
you think I stylist lose make y la piel

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,280
build up hill and he distilled you have

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:51,990
this that I I it will use disabled up to

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,990
build your list another test

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,930
so to Mabel Travis you need to find

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,230
steps once you've got a company while

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:03,790
you go at assignment kick up to trap see

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:07,750
I network you act repositories screams

00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:15,120
like this you look the switch and that's

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:15,120
it any questions so far

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:26,449
basically traveling energy granted when

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,550
you push events grab seats noted by any

00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:32,570
kinetic and also need were dressed

00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:34,160
rather than any wrench you can buy all

00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,610
the same branch you can specify with

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,120
wrenches wants your configuration pot

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:42,850
that but not me the other court was was

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,979
born West's anybody does a pull request

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:50,510
traps instead of I have school grab that

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:55,580
from the tests and know-how distribution

00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:57,770
of reports on like locations you can't

00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,479
send various limitations and I a slide

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:08,060
on it but yeah there's a high-quality

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:12,550
valuation so build things it's basically

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:15,410
how to read get 120 pardesh over time

00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:18,320
here's the website will show you that

00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,909
and I can I think it's time after I

00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,249
don't

00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:27,159
so building that every this is as easy

00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:29,979
as like I said there's a customization

00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:32,469
thing I want to do so the short version

00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:34,449
here is two lines of let's just grab

00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:37,419
something from the internets and saline

00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:42,569
ballot because you're using HTTPS that's

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:45,790
absolutely safe looks appears one care

00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:48,370
the longer version is that it does these

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,889
steps a little clone the traffic rotella

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:53,649
Reuters around some initialization don't

00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:57,129
pearl report which purchased build build

00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:59,439
your disk that get there so this before

00:08:57,129 --> 00:09:02,139
install set basically set up your build

00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:07,050
environment so if you need to install

00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:07,050
any special perl modules won't install

00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:13,769
your database set it up get it right

00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:16,569
this how are you that's worth making

00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:20,009
then we've got the install phase as we

00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:23,230
reinstall our dependency is our clits

00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:24,850
want to install any extra modules that

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,990
are technically a dependency or

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,550
derivative is where you mad and then

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:34,290
you've got the actual running a built

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:37,240
before script script and after success

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:39,879
so like the moments before the script is

00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,430
Robin we set up some coverage things so

00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,970
we're going to run

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:46,700
coverage our scripts is the standard

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:50,029
prove the lib directory run some tests

00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,070
jobs test files and then after he

00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:55,550
succeeded go to the report on our

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:58,220
coverage the transfer numbers also

00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:01,010
integrates with a cycle club halls which

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:05,750
allows you to view over time trends over

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:08,600
test coverage toasty steps one of you to

00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:12,110
customize the double check make you want

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:17,029
to check anything glad testing the

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:18,380
testing so in addition to that you've

00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:22,010
also got this thing called the bill

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:26,209
matrix so this allows us to have

00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:29,570
individual individual test runs would

00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:31,550
have individual settings so whereas

00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:34,310
previously we're able to say okay i

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,709
threaded pearl now i can say that on

00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:39,020
this thread pearl I want to do that

00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:41,209
these specific extra modules these

00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,690
optional prereqs and ease environment

00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:43,690
variables

00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:56,190
and I'm going into an example of those

00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:58,890
laker coverage reports as i mentioned i

00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,600
actually decided to add a single

00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,270
environment variable coverage welcome

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,580
and then only on this that coverage

00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:09,650
drawn coverage hours to take time and

00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:15,080
types of gases but we have vignettes

00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:18,870
absolutely this just a run once over

00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:24,120
then it says carro IOH you get a free

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:25,620
and treasury is also pretty so one of

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,570
the biggest things that I news Perhaps

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,660
to test for out of my optional

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:33,210
represents that's modules that may not

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,550
so on all platforms or being people

00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:38,070
don't want to burden solving these extra

00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,170
modules so I'm going to ensure that like

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:43,320
that by my program are both with and

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,970
without these optional prereqs do that

00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,370
online my top

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,959
script but it's really better or by

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:53,470
personal time they might make something

00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:56,920
else before so he's the one who called

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:59,439
about height which basically even the

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,480
module is installed it just hides it

00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:07,449
from Earl and trying to love it well

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:09,490
fail there so for the assault had

00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:13,449
consulted a high and this is where

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:17,829
customization helps and then I glowed

00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:21,209
the behind and supervised revive ops and

00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:24,399
make sure that it shuts up about itself

00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:27,040
and then in my matrix I can say okay I'm

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:31,060
going to hide one specific module for

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,829
this build and if I want to test that

00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,959
each individual feature it has to be

00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:38,740
individually an able to disable i can

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,600
run extra matrices to good as a test

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:46,779
that each individual feature is is

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:50,290
correct so more ideas for how you can

00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:52,480
use travis give the most out of it now

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,699
you can do a custom girls that Travis

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,499
comes to program is solved for you so

00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:59,739
you want to smell your own peril

00:12:56,499 --> 00:13:03,669
lives with or without copy-on-write is

00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:05,259
an easy thing you know threads +

00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:10,269
multiplexing threads without its

00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:14,009
multiplicity 1 will 56 I do not envy you

00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,009
but it's certainly possible

00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:27,180
so you can solve for example the world

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,980
works if you want to try to install to

00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,560
make sure that works on Nazi or else

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,430
they will burrow or whatever future kind

00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:39,450
of bro four thirds and you can customize

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:42,510
your applications fault send emails even

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:45,750
the impression that i receive slack in

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:51,780
chat with our place in books or

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:57,390
customized environments all right back

00:13:51,780 --> 00:14:01,290
many motions I wish I hadn't Street

00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:05,010
Station about five years ago because in

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:07,260
the dying days of the fair project one

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,930
of the other leaders well there was a

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,930
big push to move our code to get out

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:15,270
which I think was necessary and then

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:17,670
once over there the new shiny thing was

00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:19,470
Travis and somebody looked at fasting

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,960
and we were just like inundated with

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,020
failure before it said or build tanks

00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:28,440
too long and nobody explained it and it

00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:30,690
was just a bummer right and has a type

00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,230
of thing I'm very skeptical about past

00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:36,840
such that like brilliance Here I am time

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:41,390
to b c d and li SI can pull request

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:46,950
challenge request right to add travis to

00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:50,160
one of my existing models right you know

00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:53,130
for it's a gift get upset and i see i

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,380
said no because number one honey i wrote

00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:58,350
this module bed in two thousand two go

00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:01,110
ahead you know 15 years of secant tester

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,510
three fours and and i didn't understand

00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:06,600
really what Ferris was I didn't you know

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:08,540
there's that like my mighty every closet

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,480
where that is really just a repository

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:18,420
you know it's there's no kind of

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:20,850
the me the you know what's that WWE

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:24,120
network is what I am concerned it

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:26,010
concerns our right so okay so I had this

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,260
gives me a bit of background there how

00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,120
better I can think of this one use case

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,980
tell me whether you think that it's

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,029
appropriate he had the grill hype orders

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,330
particularly at this time of the year

00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:41,339
when we've just released a stable

00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,350
version and we're now in the beginning

00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,360
of the year long cycle it's been a lot

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:49,890
of changes laying that change the

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:53,100
profile for and on dress code it runs

00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,900
these tests that are commonly referred

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,640
to as BBC which does not mean british

00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,820
broadcasting corporation means bleep

00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:03,420
great seeking and you look at them and

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:07,830
and because the breakage is always on

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:11,190
like plus I illegal uses of access code

00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:16,760
right there to the buffer normal humans

00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:20,010
do p bar but the i can think that if

00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,990
because travis Haley has this test we

00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:26,100
have this test against bleed option

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:29,310
right that they act like facilitate like

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:32,490
you know everything like myself at some

00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,860
point being able to run a test that

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:37,230
takes the module comparison against lead

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,000
just to determine whether the bug fix

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,560
its out otherwise we have to wait for

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,080
whenever Andre

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,320
the next iteration of death does that

00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,029
sound like a possible approach maybe I

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,730
think the proper travis's that you have

00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:52,650
too often is an author it's your github

00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,570
repository you can put your Travis copy

00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:58,410
in there you decide whether or not you

00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:01,440
want eskalene and as the CNN testers

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:04,050
leading now I understand clear division

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,630
kind of between author based testing and

00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:09,810
what's even ancestors does if CPAC

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:12,300
testers tests the world as it is whereas

00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:15,630
you you the author testing which travis

00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,010
continued integration tests like what

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,020
you're about what you just did where

00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,810
you're allowed to release we may not

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,970
have at least yet yeah and that's kind

00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,260
of the problem between the two growth or

00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,470
the differences are young problem

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:31,320
between two approaches and while I seen

00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:33,660
ancestors d is unique is that once you

00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,000
open it to see Pat now you know the

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:39,060
entire world is going to test you press

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,270
here in Travis you can only do what you

00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:44,400
know or won't attach so we have one

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,950
accessibly they believe is going to have

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,310
a problem your code if you can test it

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:54,920
but otherwise my default like that's how

00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:58,400
unfortunately you might be able to have

00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,830
way of using our vacations to have that

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,470
channel because you can use the matrix

00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:08,390
happy when you have another why send to

00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:11,150
some other place that book it's

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:15,830
something to be worth looking into but I

00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:18,890
still thinks you have less valuable more

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:22,580
many more testing testing program us

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:25,070
with him yeah of course preview version

00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,360
we get out SE han he has to put up there

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,900
by the odd which requires cause

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,880
conditions whereas I think that I can

00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,560
clone to get up hit the deposit it

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:38,270
mee-mah district how to make it a like

00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:41,510
comment and you know that's actually

00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:46,790
gonna come here you know oki data you

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:51,730
know if they you know and Travis CI

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:55,150
doesn't believe in Julie testing works

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,150
sign in for us

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:05,950
okay so instead this is testing and just

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:15,520
posit or ease that I'm dead too I did

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:19,210
not turn on okay so yes I can turn on

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:24,000
books to food four projects turned out

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,000
and then if you're trying to sleep here

00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:33,790
which is working okay very simple

00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:35,980
question probably track see item is this

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:38,050
something that only works on github I

00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,380
know you mentioned that there's it's

00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,380
free

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,799
to my knowledge they have not had a lot

00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:01,519
of that as external much like chains or

00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:01,519
logic or some hints

00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:14,930
yes are you on tennis practice

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:19,550
like it's loc hanumana dude and life

00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:22,220
through traffic Packer my princess I was

00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:25,910
trying to have Travis obviously employee

00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:29,780
website burned for longer sir and I can

00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:32,210
get it to itself module template and

00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:36,140
then we want to have it like a journey

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:44,180
to basically create art book it and put

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:47,480
in this data p whenever I try to get

00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:50,270
trench to the more websites or pushing

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:53,510
out I would expect that they've got

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:55,789
protective cruelty on there because I

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:59,450
can imagine translate

00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:02,929
very very terrible things and it allows

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:06,679
I love services to get to you know you

00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:10,909
know matrix of 50 units have seven one

00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:13,009
eight two thousand places so easily has

00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:18,289
to take control like better gonna follow

00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:22,549
fast for that I generally get repository

00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:26,559
or use gave up hooks that kinda thing so

00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:26,559
get on there

00:21:28,729 --> 00:21:35,309
so our time there's some examples I on

00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:39,330
statins project as an example Travis and

00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:44,690
he hacks class like riff sushi has

00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:47,519
written an extensive set of Travis

00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:50,099
configurations for very large one

00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:53,190
thing's a bunch of custom scripts so you

00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:55,349
want ideas where you some look at it's a

00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:58,200
very crazy things you more Travis I

00:21:55,349 --> 00:22:00,440
check out your ex class and thank you

00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,440
