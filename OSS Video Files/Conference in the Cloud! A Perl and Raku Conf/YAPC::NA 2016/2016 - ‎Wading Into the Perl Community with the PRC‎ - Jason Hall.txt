alright so I'm getting started I'm Jace

00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:12,360
Jace yeah get a little background on the

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:15,509
parole request challenge pull request

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,190
challenge all the fun that I learned

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,500
from it and that I think other people

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,080
can and really we kind of thought this

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,430
might be a great way to end our overall

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,230
beginners track helping people

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,609
understand paper there's a lot of

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,199
Mutual's you've been taught there's a

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,359
lot of things you hopefully learning gap

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,830
see what can you do with that now how

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,200
can you actually learn more through out

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,730
here and really believe the pull request

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,320
challenge is one of the best ways to be

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,579
out of that so kind of talk about

00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,969
picture here my son staring at the ocean

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:48,329
the waves coming in why is it hard to

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,820
get involved in the community now I

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,770
actually want to change my top a little

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,280
bit referencing yesterday who is here

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,809
for the beginning lightning talks anyway

00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,420
remember the great liking talked and

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,460
talked about

00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,760
how you know programming and programming

00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:06,220
for 60 years never he'd been working and

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,320
I say oh I'm kind of fun I'm the exact

00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,689
same way and that's why I gave this talk

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,110
and he's talking I'm like oh I was going

00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:15,610
to say that same thing so great i get a

00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:19,780
few more minutes because just friends

00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:22,149
his that's great I program the property

00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,640
for years and I was doing okay for

00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:26,740
myself you know a good job knew what I

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,810
was doing but I was always intimidated

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,880
by the community whether the IRC

00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,190
community which sometimes had its ups

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,330
and downs or looking at Sipan and some

00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,729
of these great tools they're just

00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,399
feeling lost how wonderful someone were

00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,990
I never had tools that I thought were

00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,459
good enough to put out necessarily on my

00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:47,619
own if I could because a job constraints

00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,810
but often times I just felt like I was

00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:52,569
in my own little boat out on the ocean

00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,509
kind of lost him to see some great tools

00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:57,159
out there which I love Harlan but felt

00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:59,319
that I wasn't necessarily giving back

00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,190
very well and I wasn't flirting as much

00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:05,830
as I probably

00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:08,500
process so yeah I felt a little lost not

00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:13,180
developed exposure so what happens

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,760
consider the PRC now the pull request

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,250
challenge is programmed to start by Neil

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,640
Bowers who here is familiar with me Bo

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,740
Bowers is he's one of the great names in

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,320
the programme unity' partly because of

00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,660
the great work he's done with Sipan and

00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,550
testing and just helping people focus on

00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,670
some of the quality of the code that's

00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,900
out there he's been very vocal voice

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,480
really loves helping people out there

00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,830
and so he came up with this program kind

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,470
of based on what some other people in

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,590
doing and challenges of trying to get

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:48,730
people to take bite-sized chunks how

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:52,600
kind her grace how I adapt and I really

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:54,290
hope he doesn't dislike my face swap we

00:02:52,600 --> 00:03:01,579
visit next month you might be

00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:03,620
bro why so what is the full request

00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:06,709
challenge basically it's a concept where

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,239
you know a lot of times you might look

00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:10,760
for something to do like I said you're

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,819
looking at that huge ocean of code or as

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,579
he is out during the the river of secant

00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:19,340
that's huge that we use going across and

00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:20,659
just you get lost everything's moving it

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,790
and you don't know where to start you

00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,650
don't know how to pick something you

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,079
know I'm not going to pick on you know

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,909
hey take ABI and say i could rewrite

00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:30,920
that because i want to learn something

00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:34,669
no you need something you can actually

00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,590
do so the idea is let's start making it

00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:39,019
easy will have a list of modules that

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,579
will give out some assignments and will

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,819
give you something if you're on this

00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:46,430
list and say hey here's a module

00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:49,269
sometime in the next month figure out a

00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:52,489
way to get a pull request on this module

00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,810
so that has certain things involved in

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:55,819
it you know that means the module has to

00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,040
be on qik hub ask that i should be

00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,989
published on Sipan and there's some

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,359
other factors that help in creating a

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,760
list that will cover but but it's nice

00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:07,909
because it is a module that already

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,750
exists is in that River so it's

00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:10,250
something that you might

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,960
already use or it might be an emergency

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,520
and that you don't know about yet and

00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,750
it's an opportunity to learn something

00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,100
new something you didn't know about and

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,200
with that that means it's already got

00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,850
codes you're not we are detecting

00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,180
something new you don't have to create a

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:28,370
new project you're not gonna you know

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,230
come up with hey I need a project for

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,540
Sipan so i'm going to write a template

00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,790
language or something really unique and

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,650
i'm gonna create blog software right

00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,510
there's affiliated one of those already

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,870
if you don't necessarily just need a new

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,980
one just because you need a project

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:44,930
there's some great ones out there why

00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,820
don't you take the time to learn one of

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,610
these and they see what you can do to

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,110
help out with it and part of the other

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,390
thing probably other reason it's

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,120
designed the way it is is if you are

00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,380
already familiar with get out well

00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,890
that's where a lot of projects are

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,330
moving to and actually the number of

00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,850
issues responded to and the pull request

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,400
against the project has a lot of bearing

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,500
on how people perceive the language or

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,530
how people perceive the modules

00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,320
usability if there's traction in its

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,090
little sub community people are going to

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,370
say oh hey maybe this is more stable

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,830
this is something I can look at i can

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:25,520
use because how many people gotta see

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:27,050
man got up there and search for some api

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,820
or something you're interacting with you

00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,620
get five responses because of course

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,900
there's

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,850
way to do it and you immediately order

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,550
by what was the last one that had a

00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,560
release for the last one that had a

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,449
change usually you want the most

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,949
frequent one because well it's more

00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:44,889
likely that that would actually works

00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:47,380
it's been updated but the fact it is on

00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,660
parole especially with more stable api's

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,729
there's a pretty good chance that some

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,710
module that was last touched three years

00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:57,610
ago still that's one because hey just

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:59,050
still works but you know what maybe some

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,669
people have you been using it as much

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,800
because the documentation is a little

00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:05,470
off or there is something on and just

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,900
going in to get up and helping interact

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:12,460
with the community that helps move it up

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,110
and get subtraction so you sign up for

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,570
the pull request challenge and we'll

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,669
discuss how later the slides and you get

00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,680
it assign each month you give this one

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,870
thing that you can take a whole month to

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,840
figure out how to interact with it and

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,400
it doesn't have to be a big change but

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,080
you need to figure out what and of

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,610
course the first rule you get this email

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,270
the beginning of the month that says

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:36,639
congratulations you have been assigned

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:39,490
what moves its kind of Greg I had DVD

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,590
mysql to my first ones I'm like oh my

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:45,130
gosh I have no idea what to do but

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:47,590
really don't hang okay why don't you

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,139
pack well first of all the assignment

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,120
email besides that name also comes out

00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,130
with some helpful links they'll link to

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,930
things such as the medicine ham page

00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,750
which is a wealth of information about

00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,330
the launch previous things other links

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,789
to

00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:05,659
about it things such as the quality

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:07,129
score or sea pen testers results it'll

00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:09,020
also linked if there's any give of

00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:11,810
issues or our team jackets depending on

00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,580
what system you're using so there's a

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,469
lot of other information it will do and

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,500
try and give you some hints of of PC

00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:19,930
things that you might look at this brush

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,860
but really once you've read that email

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,080
and you've gone through a little

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,729
background there's one thing that you

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,060
should do before anything else and that

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:30,860
is just email the authors of this module

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,300
introduce yourselves and this is this is

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,310
the best thing so many people will jump

00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,379
into a project they'll get their ticket

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:40,520
and three weeks later and say well I

00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:41,870
can't figure out what to do well email

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,569
me over and there's a pretty good chance

00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,490
that they know something that might need

00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:49,069
some help and if you introduce yourself

00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,110
and say hey I am totally gonna pearl but

00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,849
I'm just trying to get started could you

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,710
tell me how I might be able to help

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,810
pretty good chance they're going to come

00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,009
back with you know what I've got this

00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,479
stuff over here that I just haven't

00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,490
gotten around to doing you know maybe

00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,800
got some documentation updates that need

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,740
some help or here's some simple task sir

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,650
here's a list of DOMA bugs that haven't

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,509
published

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,580
right there usually going to be willing

00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:18,039
to feed you something to your skill

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:20,860
level he just talked to me about it so

00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,569
with that you search out oftentimes of

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,550
the low-hanging fruit I mean the idea of

00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:27,699
the pull request challenge isn't to give

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,770
you huge projects that need to dedicate

00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:31,270
your whole month to fixing some major

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,649
architectural challenge right you're

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,079
looking for smaller stuff that you can

00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:38,050
help out to get too familiar and to get

00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:40,060
some flaw requests going so they've

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,459
broken out a broke out of couple

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:45,850
sections of locating for the first one

00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:47,500
code once look for over bows like I

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,839
mentioned if they're in our tea or if

00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,120
they're in hub issues you know go

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:57,490
through there and sometimes there will

00:08:52,120 --> 00:09:00,940
be a list in the doctor locks themselves

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,889
there will be some hay nomas or edge

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,199
cases things like that right those are

00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:07,570
some opportunities you look if you don't

00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:10,540
know if they're on RT or get up well

00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,949
there's actually a standard in the meta

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,360
data that you can put in there if

00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:15,880
there's an easy Florida bust you can say

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,319
for any point people through there and

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,649
all the sudden medicine and start

00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:22,569
pointing independent formation on that

00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:25,300
regulators of those easy full requesting

00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:27,670
you can do to help them out but ya

00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,730
lookin fer to do sore fix me ur in the

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,889
readings sometimes when I look at code

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,130
say hey there's some modernisation you

00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:39,279
know maybe you know move really well and

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,470
this is a module that is just you know

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,630
it's from the mid-2000s it never had a

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,850
modern object system you'd like to

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,550
update it to well that's an example of

00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,850
that might be a good idea but definitely

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,670
is

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:54,730
the author first not everyone likes move

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,740
or maybe they prefer moose or whatever

00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,690
else but that's an opportunity when you

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,449
introduce yourself say hey I have this

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:04,329
skill said if you want I can help update

00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:07,149
that something like it some won't but

00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:09,519
talk to me along with that maybe it's

00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:11,649
just updated toolchain sometimes people

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,170
are dependent on a Sipan module that's

00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,970
maybe the deprecated or it's no longer

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,920
useful or if there's something nicer out

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,620
there offered I think maybe switch to

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,540
that other times maybe they just have

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,670
code that they implemented themselves

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,160
that is better served by another part of

00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,000
CN right maybe you will say okay I'm

00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,519
going to take a whole bunch of

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,040
handcrafted stuff you're doing and

00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,959
replace it with file path or something

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,060
all right pitch that to the office eight

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,579
would you have set this if I can help

00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,050
your coat a lot of times they'll like

00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:43,480
that or they'll at least have a

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,579
discussion about now as a beginner you

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,589
might not know bills but let me tell you

00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:49,509
after a year the glory west challenge

00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:51,269
you're going to know a lot more CNN be

00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:53,439
familiar with some of these things that

00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:55,000
that's one place that it really helped

00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:56,620
me it got me into some hedges as you

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,199
know that I never used before and all of

00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,550
a sudden my code became even better and

00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,459
all stuff that I never thought to search

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:06,360
the ANA for all of a sudden become

00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:08,980
must-haves in my tool really help either

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,480
so if you have on a test I mean you can

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,940
just start out by looking how

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,260
coverage you know maybe you don't know

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,350
the code but you can write some tests

00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,990
against you as you're learning test it

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:22,329
out make sure it's working also look I

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,940
mean CPAP testers has a great grid and

00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:27,250
your email link to it and you can say

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,860
great do they have any dimensions where

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,420
tests are failing let me check that the

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,290
test for long is the code wrong how I

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:37,420
felt there also test for bugs that

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,279
exists but maybe you don't know how to

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:43,449
fix this is another great room for the

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:45,310
stars you go into a project and maybe

00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:48,339
they have a whole bunch of Logan github

00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,990
issues and you have no freakin clue how

00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:51,970
to solve any of those crumbs I've had

00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,699
that where I've been given an excess

00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:58,300
module in like totally out of my league

00:11:54,699 --> 00:12:00,310
but yet hey there's some open open

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,199
issues against and I didn't know how to

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:05,620
write a Perl test to reproduce the

00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:07,329
situation guess what there's a lot of

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,850
projects that would actually prefer that

00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:11,589
to you editing their code and it's a

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,529
great opportunity it's helping out the

00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:17,829
user base as well as the other so why

00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:20,230
not look at that sometimes you might

00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:22,269
want to look at the test and break out

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:24,940
their release tests into the xt

00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:28,060
directory instead of the main current

00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:30,100
directory right so that every end user

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,260
to run through all the police tests that

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,330
are unnecessary or podcasting things

00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,540
like that break out the test coverage a

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:39,610
little bit there one that I've done for

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,990
a couple people is I've added Travis so

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,330
there and get up there's a great way you

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,640
can get free Travis rundowns against

00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:48,220
their entire area version of girl out

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,810
there that's a great opportunity now

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,790
that's something that the author might

00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,830
not want discuss it but you know that

00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,360
can be an easy way that a look anytime a

00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,850
pull request comes against it you'll

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:03,880
automatically trigger off trout's rise

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:06,880
against your honor that's so other tools

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:09,490
running program now once again pearl

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,220
critic is a set of suggestions things

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,980
that might be issues but it's a chance

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,270
for you to learn and then discuss it you

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,590
know pro critic might come up with a

00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,970
whole bunch of warnings that might lead

00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,610
you to find above that they didn't know

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,410
about but then again I just be

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,590
suggestion that the authors can say yeah

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,690
that's not the convention so but it is a

00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,000
tool to be helpful and it will help you

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:36,400
learn and understand why people are

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,010
doing something also with some of the

00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,080
conventional tools good examples maybe

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,840
some people wouldn't like being

00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,940
converted to distil so if you love it

00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:51,520
some people hate it it's a gradual i

00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:53,650
think so i'm going to use it other

00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,420
things documentation is great chance you

00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,070
know a lot of people we know has skipped

00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,230
over documentation is that are there

00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,110
vegetable if you're using this elevates

00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:04,829
it even easier with lottery or something

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,720
but maybe that's not what they want but

00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:09,570
you can't learn to head sometimes it's

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,519
just fixing typos sometimes you're

00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,279
actually doing things like working I

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,620
about how to but even the best thing is

00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:19,829
working on real world examples right

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,829
look at the code and say this actually

00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:26,100
you know if I'm having trouble thinking

00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:28,350
maybe I could be three sets of clothes

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,149
be honest a little one liner of here's

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,279
how to model juice but actually actually

00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:36,269
use these plug that into the examples

00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:38,760
directory a lot of people love that then

00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:41,220
of course just search look on promo go

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:44,399
to stack overflow and find out what

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,990
people have asked about that it has to

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,610
do that model maybe they said hey this

00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,459
model I can't figure out how to use it

00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:53,459
write an example to fix that or maybe

00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:56,519
they you know found about or maybe they

00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:58,709
just asked about a problem and didn't

00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:02,870
know about this module and so you could

00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:02,870
just help get some answers in there so

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:10,320
from there once you have a change you

00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,060
make a call request I mean it's just the

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,519
standard following it up tutorial if you

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,500
don't know how make sure you did your

00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,810
work in a new branch and your own Fork

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,810
so that all your commits our time

00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:23,370
they're nice isolation if the person

00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,040
wants do they can accept just one

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,079
commits instead of your goal

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,730
right that one part so make sure they're

00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:33,320
clean and nice make sure you're

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,110
following any contributing rules that

00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,699
they have a contributing rules if they

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,170
don't have the journeying rules and you

00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:40,820
talk to them and they said a bunch of

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,110
stuff that it were requirements well

00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,060
there's an easy older question maybe

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,540
tributing problems for them he's a

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,980
doctor mutation there's definitely

00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:52,910
things you can do to increase the chance

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:55,579
of the verge like I said talk to them

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:58,790
right make sure you know what they want

00:15:55,579 --> 00:16:00,860
what any rules they have our make sure

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,329
you haven't introduced new bugs make

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,519
sure you haven't cause performance a

00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,620
crash no player out within mighty

00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,380
prophet for out sliding see if you did

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:12,110
anything compared in the sea has the

00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,060
quality score make sure you're not

00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,209
making things worse by which are trees

00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,980
so take some time if they look at it

00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:21,740
don't just run girl tiny and saying look

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:26,899
I fixed it for you that's frustrating

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:29,360
people get in there though make sure you

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:31,760
let Neil know as you approach the

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,470
problem of what you might if you have

00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,519
any personal preferences so the most

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:39,319
common one in excess you know I've been

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,630
given several XS modules and then over

00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:44,579
melt so there is reference can say look

00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:47,009
I don't use to access

00:16:44,579 --> 00:17:07,439
but no I'll make sure you don't do those

00:16:47,009 --> 00:17:09,449
items so anyway so that's all yeah yeah

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,159
most common one is what most people want

00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:13,679
to avoid excess if you don't we'll see

00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:15,779
but if you do know some sea air maybe

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,529
just rusty look at that as a chance to

00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:21,120
learn don't be afraid of a model just

00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:23,159
because it has a certain name or title

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,439
you're not expected to do major

00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:26,939
architectural changes you're looking for

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,289
the small stuff easy stuff to get to

00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,269
know it and then based on your skill

00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:31,919
level it'll start growing and then you

00:17:30,269 --> 00:17:37,860
can approach larger ones how you belong

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:40,440
to so nope if you want to do this first

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,480

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,179

been great so last slide basically it's

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:46,150
called hit list this is the basic idea

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:48,700
not every module is on Jenna not every

00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:51,790
module that's in the river that's used

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,620
is definitely maintained there's a

00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:56,650

00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:58,150
you know adopt me namespace maybe

00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,610
