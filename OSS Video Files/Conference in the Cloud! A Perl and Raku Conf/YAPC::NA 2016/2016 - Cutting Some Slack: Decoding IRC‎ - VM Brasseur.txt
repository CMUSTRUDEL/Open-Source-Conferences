well let's get started then limited time

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,610
so much to say all right so um this is

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,200
the talk if you're not here to learn

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,150
about IRC then you're in the wrong place

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,230
i'm sorry super fast introduction

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,430
because you're not here to learn about

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,560
me out I am vm Bruce or we're all

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,720
friends here you can call me baby you

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,720
need to contact me for any reason here's

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,140
my Twitter my IRC Nick that is both on

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,590
IRC up pearl org and on freenode and my

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,300
email address I'm currently a senior

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,420
software engineering manager at Hewlett

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,250
Packard Enterprise I work in service to

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,070
a team which is one hundred percent

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,039
dedicated to upstream open-source

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,680
development that's all we do is upstream

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,180
open source I also work with somebody

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,510
who many of you know and love her name

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,890
is Allison Randall so I want to take a

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,899
moment to thank Hewlett Packard

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,190
Enterprise for loving open source and

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:04,110
for allowing me to be here today alright

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,250
so as I said I am a manager so I'm going

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,420
to start by doing something we and

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,850
management call setting up expectations

00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,500
ok so uh the content of this talk

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,119
Springs from a survey i conducted over

00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,130
200 people participated in this survey

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,680
and they gave me their suggestions of

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,610
what they thought would be good for

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,189
introductory IRC the target audience for

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,950
this talk by the way is people who are

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,840
not very familiar with IRC so if you

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,930
know IRC pretty well then you're

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,210
probably going to be bored so what am I

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,079
going to cover first of all what even is

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,500
an IRC some of the fundamental concepts

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,299
of IRC and then I will build upon that

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:52,290
to give you some commands to get you

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:55,890
started and then IRC etiquette and it's

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,780
super fast wrap up what I am NOT going

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,329
to cover and what a lot of people ask

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,439
about but we are outside of the scope of

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:06,530
this particular talk is logging how to

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,179
log your conversations on IRC

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,360
persistence how to stay on IRC all the

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,890
time

00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,690
bots so out of scope and customizations

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,640
for instance to your IRC client or

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,830
something like that I'm going to throw a

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,170
whole lot of commands at you at a

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:27,700
certain point in this talk lots of

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:29,470
people like to snap photos as a part of

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,970
you know just note-taking of this sort

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,500
of stuff you don't have to do that these

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:36,520
floods are already available on internet

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:39,480
archive they will display appropriately

00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,400
once the archive gets something fixed ah

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,290
but the file is there already there's a

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,820
PDF you can download and have a look so

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,160
you don't have to go snapping photos of

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,690
anything except for this one and if you

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,110
don't snap a photo of this one now don't

00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:55,170
worry i will show you this URL later one

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,340
final point before i get to the content

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,060
please save all your questions for the

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:03,400
end i'm easily distracted so we'll just

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:07,959
save that for the end and batch them so

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:10,840
let's get started what even is an IRC ir

00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,459
c stands for Internet Relay Chat this is

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,730
one of the earliest real-time chat

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:19,690
systems ever was invented eyes by this

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:21,519
man yarko Oh whose name I will not

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,900
slaughter um doesn't look like a nice

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:30,790
fellow right um so yarko he was a

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:33,700
student in in Finland and he was tasked

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:36,489
with kind of duplicating some BBS and

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,709
form functionality he started by

00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,630
creating a real-time chat system and

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:42,310
then it was so cool that he just dropped

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:46,769
the rest of it and only focused on the

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:49,930
real-time chat he did this in 1987 so

00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:53,739
Tim berners-lee and then to the world

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:58,870
wide web in 1988 so IRC has been around

00:03:53,739 --> 00:04:00,850
longer than than the web um so he took

00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:04,420
his fun new toy and he made it freely

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:06,640
available to everyone who wanted it and

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,170
it was often passed around on these

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,430
funny little things that look a lot like

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,769
a Save icon um

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:18,840
it therefore spread all over the world

00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:20,579
and we have him to thank and if I ever

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,440
meet him I will buy him a beer or a

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,000
beverage of his trust because i love IRC

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,030
and i'm very grateful to yoga for this

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,530
so thank you i OC or Thank You yarka for

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,300
IRC also most IRC usage hit its peak

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,550
right around two thousand and four or

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,990
five and that was primarily driven by

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:42,000
gamers at that time quakenet was one of

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,500
the largest IRC networks for the longest

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,870
time just millions and millions of

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,900
people used to use IRC it's kind of been

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,180
on the wane since then but the up

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,840
freenode IRC network which is what this

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,150
is for the freenode IRC network supports

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,759
hundreds of free and open source

00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,380
software projects it's the exception to

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,099
the rule it has grown almost

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,870
consistently throughout its entire life

00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:08,789
right now you can see here at the end

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,060
it's kind of tapered off a bit and

00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:14,039
leveled out we're around edimax of

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,820
ninety eight nine so nearly ninety nine

00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:20,190
thousand users now it's around 80,000

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:25,620
and holding steady at the moment it has

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:27,570
over 50,000 channels it's really big pay

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,830
attention in that notification there um

00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,599
so uh you don't get to be the venerable

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,760
age of what have you i'm not going to do

00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:38,669
math right now without getting a bit of

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,039
a reputation and often reputations are

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:44,250
negative there are a lot of criticisms

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,340
about IRC people say it is arcane and

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:50,280
opaque to learn they say it's not logged

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,050
by default and so therefore it's bad you

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,909
don't get your scroll back you don't see

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,430
what happened automatically you have to

00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:58,320
do some stuff for that you don't have a

00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,669
persistent presence by default so if

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,409
somebody sends you a message and you're

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:04,860
not online you won't see it and they see

00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:08,250
this is a very bad thing but primarily

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:11,400
they say it's not shiny and this is a

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:15,150
problem for a lot of people I prefer to

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,759
focus on the benefits of IRC it is

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,469
ubiquitous and it is open to anyone with

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,510
an internet connection if you have a

00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:24,540
device which can connect to the internet

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,580
odds are remarkably good that some in

00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,040
austria's nerd has created an IRC client

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,830
for it so you can probably connect to

00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,490
IRC from anywhere on almost any device

00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:38,010
in the world it's very very very

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,980
lightweight very low bandwidth

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:43,500
requirements for IRC so if you do have a

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,720
small underpowered machine you can still

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,700
use IRC and you can't use a lot of other

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,150
chat systems because of it because of

00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,620
their heavy weight pneus it is log about

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,510
you can do this and you can do some

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,570
really great things with these logs the

00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:01,830
my team primarily works on the OpenStack

00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:05,100
open source project all public OpenStack

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,870
channels are logged and put online so

00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,610
everybody can read them and everyone can

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,170
participate really great you can do

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,960
great things with it you can also script

00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:17,730
it via bots and other things and you can

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,830
do just phenomenal things with IRC its

00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,080
discoverable and by that I mean you

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:26,190
don't have to sign up for a special

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,440
velvet rope sort of sort of user account

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,840
you can just walk in and use IRC and

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,820
when you just walk in and use IRC you

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,470
can also see all the channels that are

00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,300
out there you can see all the people

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,430
that are there you can discover what

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,160
there is to be found on that particular

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:44,400
IRC network it's not a closed sort of

00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,290
walled garden and because it's not a

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,010
walled garden it is free in all senses

00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:53,250
of the word the ircd demon which runs a

00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:56,790
lot of IRC network it's like the server

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:59,000
program it's released on GPL so you can

00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:03,960
go and do whatever you want with it and

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,660
everyone can use it and of course one of

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,840
the biggest benefits I see of IRC is

00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,880
that it is still the most popular

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,280
real-time chat system for free and open

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,260
source collaborators and users so if you

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,850
are going to be participating in open

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,700
source projects if you're going to be

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:24,000
using them than knowing at least a

00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:26,070
little bit of IRC is all you need to

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,150
participate it's great Thank You IRC

00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:32,370
that said there is a bit of an elephant

00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:34,410
in the room and that is that at least

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,710
one of these criticisms of IRC is

00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:38,470
correct

00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,820
is legitimately arcane and opaque to

00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,920
learn and that's because it was written

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,480
in 1987 and the documentation was

00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:48,490
written by people who weren't really

00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:50,200
focused on let's say accessibility so

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,720
that's all right that's why I'm here

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,770
that's I'm here to help I'm going to

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,710
start by giving you some of the

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:58,420
fundamental concepts of IRC these are

00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:01,690
going to be very basic fundamental

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,340
concepts I could go into excruciating

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,350
detail on any of them but there's no

00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,840
need because what we want to do is just

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,060
get you going with IRC and to feel

00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,730
comfortable with it so all you need to

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:16,360
participate in IRC is you need a network

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:19,450
an IRC network you need a client to

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,780
connect to that Network you need to pick

00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:24,310
a nickname and identity for yourself

00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,320
optionally you can select a channel to

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:29,910
participate in or you could just private

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,070
message a lot of people good job and

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,810
finally you need an internet connection

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,160
so we all understand internet connection

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,570
so I'm not going to get into that one in

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,340
any more detail but I will talk about

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,310
the others a bit first of all I'll start

00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:44,590
with networks so it's not going to be a

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,410
surprise to anyone in this room that a

00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:49,990
network is a collection of servers hmm

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,880
this could be one server it could be a

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,310
thousand servers it doesn't matter but

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,650
it's a collection of servers when you

00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,300
connect to an IRC network you connect to

00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,270
the network don't select a specific

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,650
server the software will find that for

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,960
you it will get the appropriate one for

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:10,150
its particular use case and needs and

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:12,250
your location there are a number of IRC

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:15,190
networks out there I'm going to focus

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:19,810
particularly on the ones related to free

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:21,730
and open source software we have oft see

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:24,730
this is the open and free technology

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:28,420
community if you are participating in

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:30,970
anything related to debian tour stuff

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:36,970
any number of other projects they're on

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:39,880
oft see mozilla runs its own IRC network

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,070
this is not only all of the usual

00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:46,060
suspects as far as I are Mozilla

00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:50,030
projects but it's also rust so if you're

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:54,060
learning rust go to Mozilla

00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:59,250
we have our own IRC network IRC pearl

00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:01,380
org and then obviously freenode which

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,860
I've already mentioned and that lovely

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:07,230
graph of growth so once you select a

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,970
network that you wish to issue which

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:13,350
connect you need something to do that

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:16,850
and that would be a client so IRC

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:20,190
clients we've been doing this since 1987

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:23,130
right there are so many client options

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:27,000
out there so feel free to shop around it

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:28,770
is a very personal choice so what I use

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,530
may not work for you what Chris users

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,870
may not work for you but it's a very

00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:36,540
personal choice so based upon the

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:39,120
results of that survey i did just to get

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:42,420
you started to try and find your first

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:46,370
IRC client the most popular ones by

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:48,720
desktop platform for windows it's mirc

00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,890
almost every single windows user who

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,320
submitted that survey uses mirc if

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:59,310
you're a linux user then irsie or we

00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,740
chat and typically linux users because

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:05,010
we seem to be a bit more advanced or

00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:10,290
we're just I know like the pain we do

00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:14,520
these via a screen or team accession for

00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:17,490
OS X yay Apple for OS X the most popular

00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:20,310
one is textual now I used to use textual

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,200
but when i started at Hewlett Packard

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,570
Enterprise soon afterward I switched my

00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,890
IRC client for my own particular needs

00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:30,150
and the one I use is IRC cloud this is

00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:33,120
not just a client but it's a full

00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,830
service for which you pay it is five

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,210
dollars a month and it's worth every

00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:42,750
bloody sent it has its own clients for

00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:45,330
web Android iOS and every single desktop

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:48,570
by an electron app so you can use it for

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:52,020
everything it solves a lot of those

00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:54,390
problems in those criticisms it gives

00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,460
you scroll back all the time it gives

00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,140
you online persistence it has

00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,160
integration with a lot of other services

00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,230
such as Twitter it has it

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,639
paste bin I mean it's really great I

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:08,920
love it so much it is also dead easy to

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,810
use so therefore it's great for new

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,519
people you don't have to think about a

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:17,970
lot of stuff but I'm not a new IRC user

00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,810
and I use this it's really great and I

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,199
particularly use it because you see all

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,610
these clients hear your conversation

00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:27,339
seamlessly get handed off between all of

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,589
them and as I mentioned my team does

00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:32,379
work on OpenStack therefore i use IRC

00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:34,389
for my job and my team needs to be able

00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:36,970
to contact me whenever and wherever I am

00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:38,439
they can do this now and I don't get

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,779
dropped messages it's fabulous I love

00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:43,839
IRC cloud and I will tell you that I

00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:46,060
don't get a kickback for this um I just

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,310
really do think it's a good tool in a

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,740
good service and it is particularly good

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,720
for new people so you got your client

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,060
whichever one you've chosen in whichever

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,600
one you prefer now you need an identity

00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,670
and that would be your nickname in

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,189
almost all of the documentation this

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:06,130
will be called a Nik it's not usually

00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:09,519
spelled out so if you see Nick's it's

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:13,630
not some person whose name is Nick this

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:16,959
is your IRC identity IRC is fully

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:21,100
text-based so your name is who you are

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:25,630
online this is you in IRC this is like

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:27,730
your IRC body any number are you can use

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:30,430
any valid characters for this and and

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:34,350
there are even some alphanumeric and

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:37,449
you've got some little squiggly bits

00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:39,880
according to the IRC RFC and of course

00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:41,829
there's one of those the max number of

00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,809
characters for your name is nine but

00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:45,939
that's not actually true it seems to

00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:49,180
vary by network for instance on freenode

00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:53,370
at 16 I didn't get the chance to look at

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:56,079
how for the maximum for IRC pearl or but

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,970
really it's not nine you can have a

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,800
longer name than that so you pick your

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:04,089
nickname um and then there are channels

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,410
channels are a pretty fundamental thing

00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:07,059
and it's easy to understand because

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,699
we're all familiar with this concept now

00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:13,170
channels are just a chat room if you're

00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:14,880
not in the channel then you can't see

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,980
or participate in what's going on in

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,310
that channel that's it all right so

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:24,990
channel names typically start with a

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:27,329
hash or a hash hash there are some other

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,470
ways to start a channel name but you're

00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:32,639
never going to see them because you're

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:36,149
not an admin so hostile hush-hush this

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:39,570
is a convention that they start with a

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:41,910
hash or a hash hash IRC Pearl dot org

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,310
channels typically do not use hash hash

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:47,430
they only have a single hash so the

00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:50,459
convention is that if it starts with a

00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:53,220
single hash it's a more professional or

00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:56,970
official channel so for my team for

00:15:53,220 --> 00:16:01,440
instance hash openstack dash dev this is

00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:03,570
an official channel of OpenStack and

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,920
that is going to be logged for OpenStack

00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,990
they have their own particular loggers

00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,410
and they put all those logs online if

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:12,360
it's a hash hash say its hash hash

00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,579
OpenStack dash social that's what the

00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,980
OpenStack community gets together to

00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:19,649
talk about movies and cocktails and

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,899
things like that it's a much more casual

00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:25,050
sort of channel but this is not enforced

00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:27,630
anywhere hash versus hash hash it's just

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:31,550
a convention but it is something that

00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:34,320
people assume you know now you do

00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:37,320
channels can be hidden or private or

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,990
invite only but they're typically not by

00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:43,040
default anyone can join any channel at

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:47,040
any time some examples of channels on

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,110
IRC doctor or you have Hoshi up see if

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,480
you haven't joined the hash Yap see

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,980
channel yet please do we've been having

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,380
wonderful conversations there all week

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,060
posh pearl help which does exactly what

00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,069
it says on the tin that's where you can

00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,459
go to ask for assistance with pearl and

00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:05,100
to plug my own perl mongers group

00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:06,750
portland represent we have hash pdx p.m.

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,490
if you're a member of a perl mongers

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:12,870
group odds are pretty good it'll have

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:16,400
some sort of IRC presence on IRC org so

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,400
i need coffee

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:24,480
these are the foundations upon which all

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:26,400
of IRC are based now that we know these

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,020
things we can get into some commands so

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,270
you can actually get up and running and

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:36,390
be as useful at IRC as everyone so

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:40,080
generally speaking for IRC commands they

00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:44,040
start with a slash and they often accept

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,570
or require at least one argument now I

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,360
am going to show you a lot of examples

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:51,360
of commands going forward so you can see

00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,430
these how they work again you don't have

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,470
to go scrolling everything down because

00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,600
the slides are already available for you

00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,640
so you can just use those as you notice

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:04,170
if you want so first of all you've

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:07,700
picked your nickname my slides did wonky

00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:11,490
thing so um ok so you pick your nickname

00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:14,670
you should register it because IRC is

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:17,310
kind of free and open if you don't

00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:19,620
register your nickname then somebody if

00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:23,430
you're not using it can use it instead

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:26,460
and as I said this is your body on IRC

00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:29,040
so if your body walks into a channel and

00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,750
it's filled with someone else's mind it

00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,630
can be very confusing for people who are

00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:36,600
used to you being in that body so if you

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,610
register your NIC that won't happen in

00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,280
order to do that you use Nick serve and

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,770
Nick serve is a name nickname management

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:49,200
service that runs on almost every single

00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:52,920
IRC network so to do it you run this

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,070
command you send a private message to

00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:58,590
nick serve with the register keyword you

00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:01,140
give it a password and your email

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,000
address notice you're not entering your

00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,700
Nick here that's because you've already

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,290
connected to the network with a nick so

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,470
you have to be using the Nick that you

00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:13,290
want to register and so you give this

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,840
them this information this email address

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,370
for some networks is used to confirm

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,860
that you actually do want to register

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,870
that Nick so a confirmation e-mail and

00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,520
otherwise it's not used at all unless

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,080
you happen to have forgotten your

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,030
password you need to get an admin to

00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,940
mail you it's not use it's not shown

00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:31,260
anywhere so don't worry about that do

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,800
give a real email address

00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,210
for this so here's you can't see the

00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,490
example but it is available in this

00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:42,690
slide so that's why it's here but my cat

00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:45,690
Percy registered using a password which

00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:48,360
was not password and here's what he sees

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,920
after he does this all these examples

00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,170
are based on freenode because I didn't

00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,620
want to screw with my IRC pearl dot-org

00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,300
setup and free notes pretty easy because

00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,410
it has a web interface that you don't

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,290
have to screw with the rest of your

00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:04,160
setup so Percy now has a registered Nick

00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:06,570
he is registered as Percy go Percy

00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,750
alright so now that he's registered he

00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:12,120
goes away and he comes back he needs to

00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,790
login he needs to identify that's what

00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:19,620
logging in is known as on IRC it's

00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:21,900
identify so to sign in this is the

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,980
command this is not required you don't

00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:30,000
have to identify on IRC you can just use

00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,650
your NIC it's okay that's fun but if you

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,500
identify there are certain things that

00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:36,330
benefits that can give you um it's

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,160
pretty more advanced stuff so I'm not

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:41,280
going to get into them but really it's

00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,890
just generally a good idea again to do

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,390
it you send another message to nick

00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:48,360
serve a private message to the nic serve

00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:50,370
with the keyword identify give it the

00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,480
NICU want to use and then the password

00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:57,210
you set here's what happens with Percy

00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,880
on freenode says yes you are now

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:03,510
identified for Percy what a smart little

00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,550
kitty all right so this is the nickname

00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,040
that you chose but you don't always have

00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:11,100
to use it you can change your name at

00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,830
any time on IRC to anything you want as

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:19,260
long as it's not already registered or

00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:22,070
used that's quite easy to do but you

00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,420
should remember that this takes effect

00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,320
network-wide not just on that channel so

00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,820
if you're changing your name to

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,210
something snarky because you want to be

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,760
funny to a friend on a channel and say

00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:36,330
you happen to use IRC professionally as

00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,580
some of us do everyone will see that so

00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:41,130
don't change your name to asshat and

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:43,290
then go talking to your VP because he's

00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,760
going to see that ah nah I

00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:48,990
actually have not done that that was not

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:51,240
the voice of experience so it does take

00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:55,230
effect network-wide all you have to do

00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:58,050
is send the command / Nick with your new

00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:01,050
name and to switch back to your old Nick

00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:03,660
just / Nick again you can keep / nicking

00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:07,230
all you want here's Percy changing his

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:08,880
name to Percy cat and this when you

00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,350
change your name often people will see

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,780
it in the channels they can turn off

00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:15,120
that seeing that but often they'll see

00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,130
that here time changing his name back

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,820
another thing he wants to pretend to be

00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:22,290
Nigel my other cats but Nigel is smarter

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,300
than Percy and so he's already

00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:27,210
registered his neck that nickname is

00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:30,030
already in use so that's how that

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:32,700
happened so you're on the network you've

00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:34,050
got your name but you're not really

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,610
there to get an A and you're there to

00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,860
talk to people so how do you get into a

00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,710
channel it couldn't be easier it's so

00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:43,620
easy I didn't even give you an example

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:46,320
and that's just /join and then you give

00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,810
the name of the channel the name of the

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:53,760
channel includes the hash in the hash

00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:55,350
hash that is part of the name if you try

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,740
and join a channel without putting the

00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:01,050
hash or hash you're not going to get in

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,320
this can be slightly confusing I will

00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:06,330
cover this in another slide but

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,670
nicknames Nick's can sometimes have

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,400
little characters in front of them you

00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:14,340
should not use those when talking to

00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,200
people but you do use the hash in the

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,080
hash hash in front of a channel name so

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:24,420
you join that if you hash join something

00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:27,240
and got it if you have joined something

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:29,160
and let's say you fat finger it and you

00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:35,370
typo and that channel doesn't actually

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:38,520
exist it does now IRC will automatically

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:40,860
create any channel that you want if it

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,350
doesn't already exist you can just join

00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:46,530
it it's pretty cool IRC channels are

00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:48,060
cheap you can join one and get your

00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,710
stuff done and then leave and so you can

00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,240
have very special purpose channels so

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,220
you just want to have a talk about one

00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,300
specific thing you can name you channel

00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,230
one specific thing and then tell

00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,660
everyone to join it have that

00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,100
conversation

00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,560
and then you leave then you don't have

00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,650
to take up all that space in another and

00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:04,480
another channel and add a lot of noise

00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:07,240
so for instance if you wanted to join

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,820
hachey ops ii and you do this is the

00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,410
command you pause super easy boom but

00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,960
you do have to be on the IRC that pearl

00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,610
de or network first so you've done your

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,290
stuff you've you've had that little

00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,090
special conversation with somebody and

00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:22,660
hashed out whatever it was you needed on

00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:24,340
a bug or something you need to leave the

00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,510
channel you don't need to leave the

00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,010
channel but you kind of want to leave

00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:31,060
the channel that couldn't be easier

00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:33,430
either / leave with the channel name you

00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:36,700
can run this command from any channel

00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:39,220
and you will leave the named channel

00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,050
there but if you're in that channel you

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,870
can just do / leave and then you'll be

00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:45,520
gone that's it so what happens after

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:48,430
this depends upon your clients

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,410
implementation some clients will remove

00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:52,210
that channel from your channel listing

00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,560
so you don't see it you can be in as

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,170
many channels as you want by the way

00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,920
knock yourself out so some clients will

00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,600
other clients such as IRC cloud just

00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:04,750
marks it as kind of an inactive channel

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,290
and it lesion in your list so it Lots

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:10,060
really an implementation detail alright

00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,500
you're in a channel but what are you

00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,150
going to do there you're not there just

00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,430
to sit around and listen all those you

00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:17,860
should that's a different slide you want

00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:20,500
to say something that's super easy just

00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:23,290
type something that's not a command hit

00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:26,110
enter now you're talking if you want to

00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:28,870
type a command at the as the very first

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:31,870
thing of your of your message there's a

00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:34,360
way to do that you can use the / say

00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:36,220
command so rare almost nobody does it

00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,120
there's no need to do it you should just

00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:42,160
type right but if you do have to say a

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,710
command is the first thing then you can

00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,290
use / sake think of it as escaping that

00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,600
command really um a space before the

00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:53,800
commandos who escaped Sekhmet also hears

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,540
Percy um he's he's cat he doesn't know

00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:00,040
how to use IRC because well he's a cat

00:25:55,540 --> 00:26:02,410
we're lucky he could type um and here's

00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,710
him using / say he types this and it

00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,000
just looks like regular saying is all so

00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,320
you

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,030
have to use flash site please don't

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,580
really but i did you want you to know

00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:13,080
it's an option um to be honest I learned

00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,750
about this one myself when I was writing

00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,900
up this talk i was like really okay uh

00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:21,180
so you don't know you're not limited to

00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:23,460
just saying things you can also do

00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,620
things right just like your nick is your

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,450
body you can also take actions in

00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,840
channels and in conversations with

00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:34,350
people and to do that you've send

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,480
actions using the Mecum and here's Percy

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:40,110
/ me waves to the audience and this is

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:43,260
what it looks like in the RSC channel so

00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:47,010
it looks like Percy's waving to you not

00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:48,510
that he waves he's a cat right so this

00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:52,080
is what it shows in the channel you can

00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:55,860
also use me in private messages we can

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,050
have a one-on-one conversation so when

00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,830
you have a private message with somebody

00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:03,690
it can be logged by one or both parties

00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,480
no one else can see it while it's

00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:08,910
happening but it can be logged so keep

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,980
that in mind um this is not necessarily

00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:13,320
an ephemeral conversation nor should you

00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,600
assume any of the conversations on IRC

00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,330
are necessarily ephemeral because people

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,830
can log them on their own also before

00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,960
you send anybody a private message

00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:24,390
please ask for permission first go in

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,730
channel and say hey Vicky I have a

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:29,370
question can I p.m. you odds are really

00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:31,200
good i'm going to say yes if you don't

00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:33,270
ask then i'm going to get really annoyed

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,270
if I start getting random pm's from

00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:39,060
people I don't know so I do ask it's

00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:42,330
just common courtesy on IRC so to do

00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:45,450
that / message and then somebody's

00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:48,170
nickname on some IRC networks rather

00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,490
than / message you do / query and

00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,660
there's reasons for that that I won't

00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:55,320
get into because they're too advanced

00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:58,740
but um / message typically will do it so

00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,420
here's Percy he's he's messaging me

00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,940
because he asked permission actually I

00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:06,630
know Percy already so he's allowed and

00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,460
then he waved to me I say who's a good

00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:10,980
kitty and he's like oh me isn't it as I

00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,020
guess it's you shut up um so yeah that's

00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,840
this is a private message between Percy

00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,929
and me

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,730
um so let's assume Percy had no bloody

00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:21,250
clue who I am and frankly he's a cat he

00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,770
forgets who I am so um he needs to find

00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:26,860
that out you can use the slash who and

00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:30,520
the slash who is commands to return more

00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:33,940
information about a person but that's

00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:36,520
limited to what they want to share they

00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,600
don't have to give you information they

00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,110
don't have to even give you real

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,820
information so while you can use this

00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:45,970
isn't always as useful as you would

00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,919
expect for me for instance is Percy

00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:51,220
doing a who is for me here it lists all

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,919
the channels I'm in that Percy also is

00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:55,799
in its not all the channels I'm in

00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:01,120
because this would be a really long list

00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:02,980
so uh the channels I do give my real

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,140
name that's because my real name is

00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,240
pretty much my IRC Nick so what am I

00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,409
trying to hide right so this is the

00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,690
information that you would get from me

00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:12,730
on freenode other people you might get

00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:16,870
other stuff very frequently people do

00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:19,270
not give real names um so you've gotten

00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,919
tired you need to go pee you have to

00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:23,260
take a call you have to pick the kids up

00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:25,840
from school you don't have to mark

00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:28,510
yourself away but you can set in a way

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,980
status if you want and this is just

00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,210
something that you can do to let people

00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,240
know that you're not going to be

00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:36,130
answering very quickly oh so you can set

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,029
your status and that's easy enough just

00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:42,159
type / away optionally you can tell them

00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:44,340
why you're away by typing / away and

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:49,330
then putting a message after it like a

00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:50,679
sasha way back at 2200 UTC you can type

00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,890
that and let people know that but you

00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:56,590
don't have to eventually because IRC is

00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:59,590
awesome you come back to unset your way

00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:02,770
status just type / away again on some

00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:05,370
networks you can type / back on some

00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:07,720
clients it support / back instead of

00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,640
having to do / away but they both work

00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,200
so that's how you set your away status

00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,659
and then unset again this is optional

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,690
you don't have to do this but if you

00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:18,880
want great so let's get back to those

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,950
symbols I was talking about before there

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,140
are some symbols before some people's

00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:25,540
nicknames

00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,700
and when I first started I RC years and

00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,500
years and years ago I had no idea what

00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,910
they were and it was slightly confusing

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,230
I knew they must mean something well

00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:34,600
there's two that you're going to see

00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,390
most often primarily you'll see this one

00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,070
and that is an @ symbol in front of

00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:41,380
somebody's name that means they're an

00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:46,930
operator they have authority in that

00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:51,070
channel specific to that channel so I

00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:54,070
another one you will see is voiced this

00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:56,680
is not used very often it is possible to

00:30:54,070 --> 00:31:01,960
set some channels so only people who

00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:03,970
have a voice are allowed to speak and it

00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,700
doesn't happen very often but if you

00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:08,950
need support on say freenode the

00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,200
freenode support network or channel does

00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,300
this you have to be voiced in order to

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,480
ask you a question there's a bot that

00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,800
will voice you and when you are voice or

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,630
someone else's voice you'll see a little

00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,970
plus before them but primarily the one

00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:24,040
you want to know is at these are the

00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,440
operators these are the people you go to

00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:29,290
if you have a problem they can help you

00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,990
in the channel so really honest god

00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:35,140
that's all you need to learn how to use

00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,760
mechanically speaking IRC those are all

00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,580
the commands you need that is literally

00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:42,790
like ninety-eight percent of the

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:46,630
commands I ever use there's also a slash

00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:48,100
help so you can do that as well I don't

00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:51,940
know why I keep forgetting to put it in

00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:54,250
the slides but um so that's just you

00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:57,270
know how the things to type to do the

00:31:54,250 --> 00:32:00,640
things but there's also how to behave

00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:03,970
each and every IRC channel has its own

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,880
particular special snowflake culture pay

00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,650
attention to that don't just assume all

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,690
channels are the same they're not that

00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:12,910
said they do share several

00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,860
characteristics there are certain bits

00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:17,710
of etiquette that you should follow in

00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:20,530
every single channel first of all some

00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:23,380
people say IRC is a cesspit those people

00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:28,509
are wrong only certain channels on IRC a

00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:31,989
is a RSS pit in general shut up you

00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:33,729
Oh see that was me being in a welcoming

00:32:31,989 --> 00:32:36,789
place full of helpful people yelling at

00:32:33,729 --> 00:32:39,879
Dreamhack yeah IRC in general in

00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:44,529
particular with with open source

00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:46,929
projects is full of helpful people but

00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:48,489
as with any community please pay

00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:50,199
attention to the culture and the mores

00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:52,209
of each particular channel because

00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:56,649
consider each channel to be its own

00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:59,440
community tolerance breeds jerks

00:32:56,649 --> 00:33:01,539
tolerance of jerks breeds more jerks we

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,039
don't need more jerks if you are treated

00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:07,329
badly please speak with an operator and

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,769
see whether there is anything they can

00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:11,199
do about it they can potentially coach

00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:13,359
that person into better behavior if

00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:15,339
they're a real they can kick

00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:18,669
them and ban them from the channel and

00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:20,919
if it's really really bad you can find a

00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:23,889
network operator and they can ban them

00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:25,629
from the entire network so um yeah in

00:33:23,889 --> 00:33:27,609
case of jerks please report it this

00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:32,079
prevents IRC from ever becoming a

00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:35,499
cesspit also IRC is both real-time and

00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:38,339
asynchronous I am on IRC right this

00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:41,409
moment but I'm not answering questions

00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:45,190
right so uh if you do have a question

00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:47,409
stick around don't just show up wait for

00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:50,529
five minutes say ah they're ignoring me

00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:52,389
and then leave people have lives they'll

00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:55,690
get back to you you may have to wait up

00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:57,669
to a day to get an answer um but they

00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,739
will get back to you other times they'll

00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:04,839
just be there and immediately answer you

00:33:59,739 --> 00:34:05,949
so but do be patient so that's generally

00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,479
speaking what you should do in every

00:34:05,949 --> 00:34:09,700
single channel there are also some

00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:12,069
things to keep in mind as far as channel

00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:14,500
culture for each channel first of all

00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:16,269
always read the topic when you join a

00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,009
channel you will be presented with a

00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:20,019
topic and it will tell you what that

00:34:18,009 --> 00:34:23,349
channel is all about sometimes it will

00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:26,289
include some links you should read those

00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:27,819
links to learn more about what they

00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:30,309
discuss in this channel and how they

00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:32,679
behave and what they expect if you don't

00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:34,690
see a topic when you join your network

00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,879
or if it Scrolls off your screen on your

00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:39,159
client or something you can type / topic

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,419
and you can get that so it's not gone

00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,429
forever

00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:45,919
once you do show up to a network of to a

00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:48,290
channel and you read the topic you

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,409
understand everything is there lurk

00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:54,440
there sit and listen see how they

00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:56,510
interact see what they expect see

00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,550
whether they are an active channel or

00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:01,790
whether you will have to wait longer for

00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:03,260
your answer so just look for a while to

00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:06,800
get a sense of it before you start

00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:08,060
speaking if you're in a channel you're

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,859
probably there to talk to people in

00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,990
which case you will need to have some

00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:15,170
kind of etiquette tips force

00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:17,540
interactions so if you come into a

00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:20,890
channel where I am and you mentioned my

00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:24,380
name that will send me a notification

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:27,410
and it's called a ping you can ping

00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:30,020
someone if you ping someone but don't

00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:32,780
add anything else after their name it's

00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:35,119
called a naked ping and to be honest and

00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,940
ID still bother me a ton most of the

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,619
time I didn't realize how much it does

00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,200
bother people this is a huge pet peeve

00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:44,510
for a lot of people in the IRC world so

00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,910
don't naked paying someone also when you

00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:49,640
mention them a lot of IRC client support

00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:52,670
a tab completion so you don't have to

00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,260
learn how to type my name oh no one

00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,540
should have to do that now you can just

00:35:54,260 --> 00:36:02,390
type vmb and hit tab and it will get you

00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:04,730
me so yeah no naked pings this however

00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:07,550
is the biggest one almost everybody has

00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:10,400
this peep if you have a question just

00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:13,400
ask it you do not need permission to ask

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:17,540
a question or as everybody will tell you

00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:20,839
on IRC don't ask to ask just ask if

00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,820
you're in the moose channel you walk in

00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:25,030
there and you the first thing you say is

00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:27,890
hey can I ask a question about moose

00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:29,089
everyone is going to be like why the

00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:31,760
 are you here if you don't want to

00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:33,220
talk about moose so don't ask to ask

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,450
just ask you a question about moose

00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,710
don't ask for permission to do so by

00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:41,869
being in the channel you have permission

00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:44,720
to ask questions large text stumps this

00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:46,670
is rude it really ruins everybody scroll

00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:50,000
like some clients don't even allow you

00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:52,010
to do it I IRC cloud has spoiled me

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,319
because if I put a large text dump in

00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,749
there it automatically gives

00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:57,609
me a paste bin which is brilliant and

00:36:55,749 --> 00:36:59,349
then it puts a link to my large text up

00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:01,539
there but if you do have a large text

00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:03,430
dump say a big error log or a build log

00:37:01,539 --> 00:37:06,699
or something like that put it in a paste

00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:08,170
bin put it in a guest you know do

00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:09,249
something like that and put a link in

00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,690
there instead of the big dump because

00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:13,539
otherwise people are going to get really

00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:17,259
cranky other things that make them

00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:20,529
cranky rather than using / away you

00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:24,609
change your nickname to say Ambrose or

00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:27,609
way you know what I've just done every

00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:30,069
single private message I had going to vm

00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:31,660
Bruce or just got disconnected because

00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:35,289
I'm no longer be embrace or I'm in a

00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:36,969
different body people hate this it makes

00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:38,469
communication more difficult you slash

00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:41,589
away if you must but don't change your

00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:43,569
nick to show your way so once you're

00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:44,739
there and you're participating and

00:37:43,569 --> 00:37:46,449
you're starting to interact there are

00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:50,559
some things you should remember as far

00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:52,089
as your writing style first of all we

00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:56,440
are all used to using many different

00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:58,719
kinds of chats some of them to ping

00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:03,219
someone you put an ad in front of their

00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:06,369
username you don't do that on IRC you

00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:08,410
don't even if I am an operator and I

00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:13,089
have a gnat in front of my name please

00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:14,529
don't use it it's not needed uh and it

00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:17,229
was recently pointed out to me thank you

00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:19,719
Chris that it can actually screw up some

00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:21,699
clients some of the older clients will

00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:23,380
not notify people appropriately if you

00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:25,390
have an out in front of their name so

00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,029
just don't do it also some IRC years

00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:30,819
will get really super defensive and they

00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:33,579
will do things like II not slack or go

00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:36,609
back to hipchat or scrap like that so um

00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:39,579
yes who don't give them a chance to get

00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:42,160
cranky at you also well there is a

00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:43,959
character limit per message on IRC it

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,219
really doesn't matter because all you're

00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:46,359
going to be doing is typing a sentence

00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:49,479
hitting enter type again something's

00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:53,170
hitting hitting Enter so spell things

00:38:49,479 --> 00:38:57,430
out if you use textspeak people get

00:38:53,170 --> 00:39:00,880
cranky so please just write out complete

00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:04,329
words as sentences this one is obvious

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,789
and yet somehow keep having to remind

00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:08,799
people please don't shout in the channel

00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:10,089
and if you do have a good reason I mean

00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:13,479
sometimes we all need to get a good

00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:15,729
shout out right so use it sparingly but

00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:21,069
don't you know accidentally leaned on

00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:23,469
your caps lock forever also IRC does

00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:26,109
support and see colors and the first

00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:30,479
time everybody finds this out it's like

00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:33,099
you handed them a box of 96 crayons

00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:35,589
that's why a lot of clients have an

00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:38,499
option now to strip out the ansi color

00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:40,869
codes so even if you do that some people

00:39:38,499 --> 00:39:42,939
won't see it other people will it pisses

00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:46,929
them off don't piss them off don't use

00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:48,959
an see color so super fast wrap up

00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:52,509
that's really all I have as far as a

00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:55,779
etiquette really simple mostly logical

00:39:52,509 --> 00:39:58,599
but you now have everything you need to

00:39:55,779 --> 00:40:02,079
successfully IRC that's all there is to

00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:04,599
it so that wrap up I'm going to start

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,179
with some gratitude as I said I did run

00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:08,769
this survey and a number of people who

00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:12,699
took the survey agreed to be publicly

00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:14,289
thanked and here's my survey respondents

00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:16,719
the ones who agreed to that some of them

00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:19,179
are Twitter handles some of them are ir

00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:21,669
scenics all of them are wonderful I'm

00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:23,499
very grateful to all of these people and

00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:26,229
even and also to the ones who did not

00:40:23,499 --> 00:40:28,269
wish to be publicly recognized but it

00:40:26,229 --> 00:40:33,640
thank you he probably recognize a few

00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:37,269
names on there too thank you son go more

00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:41,349
gratitude it's a peregrine thank you

00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:46,689
Chris oh come on like I could pass up

00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:50,890
that opportunity um so uh pardon its own

00:40:46,689 --> 00:40:53,890
video his daughter calls him a pretty

00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:56,109
pretty pony she's wonderful you should

00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:57,880
meet her someday so Chris helped out a

00:40:56,109 --> 00:41:00,249
lot when I gave this talk the first time

00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,199
at southeast in the next best he

00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:05,109
answered some more advanced questions he

00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:08,890
is one of the admins of the IRC pearl

00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:10,959
org network so if you have any advanced

00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:13,479
questions he can help and if they come

00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:15,279
up in the QA then he will be able to

00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:16,900
help us with that he also after that

00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:19,240
reviewed the slides and gave me some

00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,410
tips on

00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,660
a little more feedback which I've

00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:25,680
integrated into this version so thank

00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:29,340
you Chris you are a pretty pretty pony

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,720
and finally I have some image credits

00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:34,330
for all of the images you've seen in

00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:37,420
here except for of course the hpe logo

00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:40,170
but so the noun project is a really cool

00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:43,480
thing you can find tiny little images of

00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:45,090
so many cool things out there it's also

00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,470
most of them are creative commons and

00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:50,560
the artists can get paid so it's a

00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:54,460
really cool project image of your co

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:57,460
from this swedish newspaper and on the

00:41:54,460 --> 00:42:00,760
freenode stats are from ircnet split de

00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:03,040
if you want to learn more about IRC this

00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,380
is a great resource for you it's got all

00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,810
sorts of amazing stats and channel lists

00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:12,850
and more IRC networks to join and lots

00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:16,300
of cool stuff so finally here is that

00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:17,800
URL again once something gets fixed on

00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,200
the archive side and it's finishes

00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,470
deriving my file there will be an

00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,600
evaluation link there as so as I

00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:27,580
mentioned I did do this talk before I

00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,910
will do it again I do all of my talks

00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:33,040
multiple times I need your feedback this

00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:36,040
is how I improve I need to hear from you

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:40,000
did I do well and how can I get better

00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:41,710
so once this is done there will be an

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,480
evaluation link there and I really would

00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:45,609
be very very grateful if you could give

00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,960
me feedback so that's all the content i

00:42:45,609 --> 00:42:49,480
have i will leave this slide up so you

00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,340
can see the URL which actually does work

00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:56,200
this time unlike my talk on monday um

00:42:51,340 --> 00:43:00,700
and now we have about seven minutes for

00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:02,970
Q&A yes sir what's your name Greg hi

00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,970
Greg

00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:12,570
oh that's a very good question um if

00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:17,700
somebody private messages you do you

00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:20,070
have to accept it it just shows up so at

00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:21,750
least in every client I've seen I

00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:24,540
wouldn't be surprised if there is some

00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:26,370
clients somewhere that has built in do

00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:29,490
you want to accept this call sort of

00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:32,820
thing but I've never seen it it shows up

00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:35,040
you can ignore it just you know you

00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,960
don't have to write back to them you can

00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,680
also there are commands to allow you to

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,050
ignore entire people so if there's some

00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,710
particular Nick who keeps getting under

00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:48,420
your skin you can just / ignore them so

00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:53,790
then their private messages you never

00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:56,270
see them anyway no no they don't um okay

00:43:53,790 --> 00:44:07,230
more questions yes sir what's your name

00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:09,330
hi Brian oh yes actually also the

00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:12,510
question is if you / join and create a

00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:16,200
new channel all you the admin it yes and

00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:17,910
no um you won't have a little upper

00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,250
symbol on you you won't officially be an

00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:23,310
operator you can register that channel

00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:27,690
and then you are the founder of that

00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:31,050
channel and you're an operator but by

00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:32,670
default no I mean anyone can become an

00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:34,800
operator and that channel sort of kind

00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:42,510
of they can register it and become an

00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:47,570
operator does it get cleaned up if oh it

00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:50,670
just goes away yeah Chris pardon a

00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:51,750
channel is no channel yeah if I channel

00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:56,360
falls in the woods and there's nobody

00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,360
there to see it Chris you have a comment

00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:17,460
oh ok so for the recording Chris points

00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,960
out that and this obviously must be a

00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:24,570
network setting that you can turn on and

00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:26,970
off services yeah so on IRC dr. org in

00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:30,450
particular if you create a channel you

00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:32,250
automatically get an operator bit so if

00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:33,930
you do that please register because

00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,160
otherwise somebody might be able to take

00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:40,430
the channel away from you should you

00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:42,960
leave ah yes more questions more coughs

00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:47,630

00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:44,819
context that you will know that they are

00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:47,219
responding to your question so that's

00:46:44,819 --> 00:46:50,160
just personal choice and whether it has

00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:52,680
a colon after it depends on their their

00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,950
IRC client and whether it has a colon

00:46:52,680 --> 00:47:00,150
after your name if they autocomplete IRC

00:46:55,950 --> 00:47:02,099
cloud does textual does not so it's just

00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,299

the range of IP addresses that they use

00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,940
