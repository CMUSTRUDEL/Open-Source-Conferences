okay folks it's 1:30 I'm gonna start

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:13,099
talking now loudly so hi hey Miki can

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,540
you get the door thanks man

00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:19,230
welcome to modern parole for the

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,439
unfrozen Paleolithic Perl programmer hi

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,660
I'm John

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,359
so disclaimer I'm going to talk kind of

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
fast throw a hand up if I skipped over

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,270
something that you want to go back and

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,850
talk about so I was inspired to give

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,430
this talk by a few online friends that I

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,379
talk to occasionally that have jobs as

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,030
Perl programmers but they're not really

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,530
engaged with the pro community they

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,570
don't come to Yap see they don't go to

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,340
local users groups they're just using

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,500
Perl to do their job to do their work

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,789
and they kind of you know hit that 9:00

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,440
to 5:00 and they go home and they have

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,920
other hobbies they're what we call

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,750
normal people and and so there's a

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,239
widening gulf whenever they ask me

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,579
questions because the way they do things

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,650
and the way we do things now are just so

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,439
disparate that that I spend like two

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,630
hours sort of banging my head saying no

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,360
why are you still doing that so I wanted

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,840
to put together a kind of an info dump

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:20,070
so high unfrozen caveman Perl programmer

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,630
welcome to 2016 so many things have

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,090
changed since you fell into that big

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:29,850
hole in the ice in 2001 but many have it

00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:34,040
there's a Clinton running for president

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,930
yeah we're still using Pearl thrive so

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,210
in 2001 when you had your unfortunate

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,610
accident the latest and greatest per

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,200
release was Perl 5.6 there are seats

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,320
down front if people want to come down

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,190
front instead of standing at the back

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:55,080
I'll pause for a second or two it's okay

00:01:50,190 --> 00:02:01,500
David doesn't bite Vicki doesn't bite

00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:05,460
either all right so in 2016 we're all

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,380
the way up to Pearl 5.24 we've had many

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,140
many language improvements over the

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,350
years you probably don't remember

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,880
unicode because in 2001 it wasn't really

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,220
that important or that well understood

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,430
and it's way too complicated to get into

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,560
here you should go to Rick's talk

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,730
tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. where he's going

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,430
to talk about billions of squiggly

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,959
little characters but just know that now

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,989
we can get really expressive in our

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,739
pearl code so it's much easier to tell

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:37,799
if a developer is happy or when things

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,750
aren't going quite as well and this

00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:41,640
should be in a very familiar way of

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,329
communication for you given your caveman

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,980
background so let's talk about some of

00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:49,859
these language features so we got a

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,940
great new feature in 5.10 called define

00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:57,819
door so who's written code like this

00:02:52,940 --> 00:03:00,519
right come on put your hands up

00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:02,689
instead in 510 you can just write this

00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,269
right and that does exactly the same

00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:07,040
thing which is really super awesome this

00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:11,480
is my favorite pearl feature of the

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,700
2000s by far this who uses the find or

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:18,470
we're gonna do a little survey yay good

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:20,750
you all rock in 5.14 we got something

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,989
called non-destructive substitution so

00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:26,299
prior to that if you wanted to use the

00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:27,890
substitution operator on a variable but

00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:29,569
preserve the original variable you've

00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,609
had to do this you had to manually make

00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:36,220
a copy and then do the substitution on

00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:39,470
the copy now in 514 you can just do that

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,849
right and that causes the substitution

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,760
to only apply to the copy and the

00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:46,609
original is unmodified who uses

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,829
non-destructive substitution I actually

00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:55,280
don't cuz it never quite stuck but I

00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:57,170
must start it's very useful in a map we

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,590
got post pick to dereferencing so who's

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,840
written the curly brace D reference

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:07,569
right who's had to explain curly brace

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:10,639
dereferencing to newbies who hates that

00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:12,230
so now with postfix dereferencing you

00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,329
can just write that and that does the

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,639
same thing it D references the array

00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:19,970
that's in dollar array wrap and returns

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:25,639
the whole list who uses postfix

00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:29,620
dereferencing you and you and Rick but

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:33,979
Rick really really likes it and and so

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,659
5:20 it went in in 5.20 and in 5.24 it's

00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:37,820
no longer experimental so you can just

00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:41,270
use it without having to turn on the

00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,280
experimental feature I'm looking forward

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,199
to trying to teach references to

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,060
beginners using postfix dereference

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,430
syntax to see if it makes more sense to

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:54,260
them but I haven't had a chance to do

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:56,419
that yet in 5.22 we got a new operator

00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,330
the double diamond operator who's used

00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:59,930
the double diamond operator not super

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,760
popular

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,010
so what Double Diamond does is it works

00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,570
just like the single diamond but when it

00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,909
goes to open the files that are passed

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,639
in on Arg V it uses a three argument

00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:10,169
open

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,750
which means that if somebody tries to

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:15,599
sneak a pipe character into your command

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:19,379
line it will no longer open a pipe to

00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:21,509
that thing it just blows up and finally

00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:24,599
we got subroutine signature support in

00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:26,430
5.20 which is a very big deal it's very

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:29,280
happy about this subroutine signature

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,900
support looks like this so you can have

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,150
a sort of a function prototype like

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,590
thing in your method declaration and

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,110
declare what variables are getting

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,240
passed in and assign them numbers and

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,069
you'll note that at underscore is not

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,479
being unpacked anywhere and it doesn't

00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:43,860
even appear on the slide that's because

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,379
all that stuff just happens

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,050
automatically who's using subroutine

00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,819
signatures yeah very few people this is

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,310
the saddest point of this talk for me

00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:57,449
use subroutine signatures people come on

00:05:53,310 --> 00:06:02,039
they don't bite it works with methods it

00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:07,169
works with everything it went in in 5.20

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:11,580
it's still experimental experimental

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:13,860
doesn't hurt it's free so it's not just

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,719
language level features however we also

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,669
have a host of new tools that make it

00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:21,060
easier to work with Perl and do Perl

00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:23,400
development so these days we didn't do

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,020
this back in 2001 but these days we make

00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,610
a distinction between the Perl that you

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,969
get with your operating system which we

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,770
call system Perl and we encourage people

00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:35,190
not to use it for their development

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:40,259
projects so that means good old user Ben

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:43,110
Perl is no more instead we use new tools

00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,240
to install new up-to-date modern pearls

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,219
outside the control of the OS and

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,189
outside the control of the sysadmin x'

00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:51,449
that you may not like the first tool

00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:56,219
that was developed for this is called

00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:59,279
perl brew and you could download perl

00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:02,659
brew at pro guru PL it has a really

00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,979
swanky website with a ninja and the

00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:07,620
ninja swings back and forth if you mouse

00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:09,389
over them that's pretty cool

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:15,530
there's also a newer option called pio

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:18,000
EMV um it doesn't have a snazzy website

00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:21,960
unfortunately but you can get it at this

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,569
URL here so but using one of these tools

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,879
offers you several advantages right you

00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,349
you solve the vendor pearl lock-in issue

00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,819
where you go well we'd really like to

00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:31,319
upgrade pearl but we have to wait for

00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,319
the operating system vendor to do it no

00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,300
you don't you just build your own if you

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,099
are a developer or if you're working on

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,500
a machine that you don't have root on or

00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:42,180
admin level access you can install your

00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,009
own version of pearl you can install

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,569
multiple versions of pearl so if you're

00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:47,490
a module author this is really great

00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:51,509
because you can actually test your code

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:53,699
against multiple different versions you

00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:54,960
can trivially switch once you've got all

00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,400
those pearl versions installed you can

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,740
trivially switch from one to the other

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,020
so you can actually run your entire test

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,949
suite across every major pearl that's

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,800
been released in the last ten years

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:06,300
before you release something you don't

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,430
need special permissions to install

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,500
modules because you're installing Mendte

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,669
directories you already own and it's

00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,469
easy to stay up to date with pearl

00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:15,449
development because both these tools let

00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:17,690
you install new development snapshot

00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:23,039
versions which come out once a month

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:25,169
just nice PLA and v has a few advantages

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,259
over Pearl brew and I mean it's

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:30,000
personally that's what I use it does

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:32,279
less magic messing around with your path

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,320
and the way it's implemented and you can

00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,599
pin pearl in three different ways you

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,089
can set a global pearl version that all

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,680
your shells will get you can set a per

00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:42,510
shell version if you just want to change

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,579
the version in your current shell

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:46,290
session and have that change go away

00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:48,779
after you close that shell session out

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,420
you can do that or you can actually pin

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:53,520
a version per project on it on a

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,820
directory level so if you have one old

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,980
project that still requires 5.14 or 5.6

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,740
god forbid you can set it up so that

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,640
when you CD into that directory

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,290
everything under that point we'll use

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,610
that older pearl while you still use the

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:10,380
newer pearl everywhere else proprio does

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,890
have one advantage over PL env I really

00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,540
like that website

00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:20,910
let's continue our survey theme who uses

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:23,550
pearl brew who uses ple and B who uses

00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:26,100
neither Wow

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:29,600
okay cool all right so speaking of

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,600
installing stuff in your home directory

00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:35,490
we have this module called local web

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,350
local Lib lets you install your own

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,730
copies of modules so even if you don't

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,100
want to build your own pearl you can

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,870
still build modules without special

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,570
permissions you can do this in your home

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,339
directory you can do it in a project

00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,019
directory so you can have if you have a

00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,329
particular project that depends on an

00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,550
old version of a module you can localize

00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:56,760
that dependency just to that project and

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,200
it integrates well with PL env and pro

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,260
brew and other tools I want to talk

00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,850
about later who uses local live in

00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:09,480
cool-cool

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:14,880
so speaking of installing stuff we have

00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:17,940
a new Sipan client called Sipan - and

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:22,890
the command-line invocation for that is

00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:27,529
CPM so this is the output from using the

00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,529
default Sipan client to install a module

00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:33,240
this is more of the output from cpad

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,579
installing the c-pen module and it

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,829
wasn't actually done yet but pacing that

00:10:35,579 --> 00:10:39,930
in the slides as a payment yes so this

00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:42,360
is the output from CPM for installing

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,640
the same module and it's much more clear

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,690
what's going on and it's much less much

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,930
more likely that if there's an actual

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,550
error you'll see it as opposed to just

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:53,519
paging by it in the noise whose switch

00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:55,490
to see Panem yeah you are all good

00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:00,920
people

00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:04,309
I used that just prompting and - -

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,790
interactive and yeah all that stuff so

00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:09,559
speaking of stuff on Sipan we got a

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,550
whole new website for interacting with

00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:15,470
Sipan medicine org which is awesome

00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,240
searched at Sipan org is still around if

00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,389
you prefer that some people do and

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,819
that's okay but medicine integrates and

00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:25,160
visualizes a whole slew of information

00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:27,980
in a way that at least i find really

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,209
useful so this is the medicine pan page

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,379
for the module that I was just

00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:32,089
installing in the previous two slides

00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:35,059
it's called git wrapper it's something

00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:40,100
that I maintained because Chris Prather

00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:42,079
made me so I'm zooming in on the the

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,970
sidebar here we have the side bar over

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,410
on the Left which is where a lot of that

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,869
information ends up being displayed

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:50,179
zooming in on that a little bit you can

00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:53,089
see that medicine provides syntax

00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:55,850
highlighted source code view it links to

00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:58,129
the home page if the distribution sets

00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:01,029
one up in the the metadata it'll links

00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:03,889
to the code repos shows test results

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:05,689
that are updated and active and link

00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:08,059
back to see pen testers and it will also

00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:09,769
give you this little activity graph down

00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:12,019
at the bottom showing you how active the

00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,759
project is been all of this is

00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:15,230
information that when you're looking at

00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,549
a module and you've never used it before

00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,069
and you're trying to decide do I use

00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:20,569
this one or that one all this stuff is

00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:24,649
things that you should be looking at and

00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:27,259
factored into that decision it's also

00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:28,670
open source so if you can think of a way

00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:31,910
to make it better you can they're

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,860
extremely responsive to both to pull

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:39,230
requests and it just talking about

00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:41,449
future ideas who uses meta Sipan yay all

00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:45,019
right we also have a new search engine

00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:48,019
in 2016 is called DuckDuckGo and it's

00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:49,519
it's cool they don't really track what

00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:50,959
you do which is nice and it's partially

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,540
written in Perl but that's not what I'm

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,309
talking about it the most useful feature

00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,129
is that they support is something called

00:12:55,309 --> 00:13:00,230
bang searches so you put an exclamation

00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:01,819
point and then a keyword and then you

00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,040
type in your search parameters instead

00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:06,559
of searching the entire web it searches

00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,580
just a particular site and if you

00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,500
integrate this into your location bar

00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,570
in your browser and Firefox or Chrome or

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,450
Safari or whatever you use it's really

00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,610
easy to hit ctrl L or whatever takes

00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:21,209
your focus up to the location bar and

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:23,700
just do bang Sipan or CPM they both work

00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:25,470
and put in a module name and you'll go

00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,079
directly to the page for that module on

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:31,440
CPM which is pretty sweet it's a big

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:35,579
time-saver who uses that not very many

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:39,390
people more people need to use this all

00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:40,649
right speaking of modules if you haven't

00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,540
been paying close attention to what's

00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:44,519
going on in the module world and since

00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,130
you've been frozen in a glacier you

00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:50,070
probably work there are a few new

00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,990
modules you may have missed out on so

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:56,220
anybody doing web development these days

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:57,839
needs to use something called Jason the

00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,180
best module to use to interact with

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,390
Jason from Perl is called Jason maybe XS

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,250
Jason : : maybe XS it will make sure

00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,870
that you a have a Jason library

00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,000
available and if you have multiple ones

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:13,320
it will pick the best possible

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,350
alternative who uses Jason maybe XS not

00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,480
very many people interesting to get a

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,589
handle on how we're doing

00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,740
object-oriented programming these days

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:25,020
in perl you need to look in the moose

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,480
moose is the meta object system of

00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,560
choice in Perl these days and then when

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,120
you're actually ready to write some code

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,500
you can probably get away with just

00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,110
using this much simpler alternative

00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,450
called mu which will make your code a

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,459
little bit faster unless you really want

00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:41,940
to get super gnarly and then you know

00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:45,640
use moose who uses moose and who uses

00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:48,220
move cool

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:52,390
I do have some bad news for you unfrozen

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:55,120
cavemen parole programmer CGI p.m. has

00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:57,190
been pulled out of core it's gone well

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,260
no not really you can still install it

00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,780
from C pad if you absolutely have to but

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:04,000
we encourage you not to the current

00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:07,240
standard for web development in Perl is

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,700
called plaque our PSG I it offers a

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,080
number of advantages over CGI and it's

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,500
the basis for pretty much every modern

00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,540
Perl web framework of which as there

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,670
were in 2001 there are many and I'm not

00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:23,860
going to get into it it's being your

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:25,330
perl websites we have quite a few of

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,100
them these days which make it easier to

00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:31,570
keep up with what's going on in the Perl

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:34,990
world so one of the problems with Sipan

00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:36,910
is that it is chock-full of stuff and it

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,860
can be hard to decide when there are

00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,330
multiple modules that claim to do the

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,330
same thing it can be hard to decide

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:45,190
which one to pick and you can use

00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,800
various criteria like is the author a

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,390
jerk or is this guy fun to hang out with

00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,370
at conferences or how long has it been

00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,620
since they last released something but

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,210
sometimes it's also good to hear from

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,640
users of the modules so we have a

00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:00,460
website now called CP n ratings it's

00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:04,120
linked to from medicine pen that

00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:07,300
provides users of user supplied reviews

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,670
of modules you can see individual

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,380
reviews which version of the module that

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,180
are reviewing how they rate it and so

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,010
forth and so on and and that's

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,140
integrated into medicine it shows you

00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:22,060
the average number of stars links to the

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:24,310
reviews we also have sea pants which is

00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:26,770
automated testing of some best practices

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,690
around module development how you should

00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,810
develop modules and make sure all the

00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:34,050
eyes are crossed and the teaser dotted

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:36,010
wait strike that reverse it

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,110
here's this what this looks like for a

00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:40,600
particular module and it's super useful

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,680
if you're just getting into module

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,790
development you're not sure you're doing

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,700
things the right way

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:50,980
see pants will let you know and it's

00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:53,230
also linked to from meta second finally

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,810
we have prepar'd which is a place to

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,700
submit module ideas and get feedback on

00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,209
them so you can find out oh actually

00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,769
this idea that I had is

00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:03,589
our diancie pan but it's under a weird

00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:05,360
name so I couldn't find it or hey people

00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,549
think this is a great idea and I'm

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,819
totally gonna do this who's used pre

00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:12,709
patent a couple of people good cool

00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:18,890
sorry was getting tired up in his arm up

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:20,329
he's just like this um we also have some

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,919
sites that make it easier to keep up to

00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,409
date with what's going on in the Pearl

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,179
world we have pearl weekly which is a

00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:28,039
once a week email newsletter that

00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:30,169
aggregates a bunch of pearl related news

00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:33,169
from all over the web was started by

00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:34,850
Gabor who was here talking you should go

00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:39,649
up to the bore and say thanks for Pearl

00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:41,299
Weekly who reads pro weekly yay and in a

00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:42,799
recent development actually was recent

00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:46,880
when I first wrote this talk it's not

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:49,010
that recent now Sawyer this was actually

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,899
before Soria was elevated to the the

00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:53,870
current lofty role that he occupies his

00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:56,720
pumpking he started wrote he revived the

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:59,659
pro/5 porters weekly email summary where

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,490
he reads all of the p5p email and pulls

00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:03,409
out the important bits and makes blog

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,580
entries and sends out an email which is

00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:06,890
awesome if you want to keep up with

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,049
what's really going down going on down

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,270
in the trenches of Perl development but

00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:16,520
you don't want to deal with the influx

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:19,159
of p-type email so thank you for

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,480
listening welcome to 2016 I hope you

00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:22,520
enjoy it it's mostly pretty cool

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,760
although maybe don't look at the

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:29,149
electoral news we're like a little bit

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,549
longer and I have a minute and a half

00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:38,620
left I'm happy to take questions or grab

00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:38,620
me later yes sir

00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:46,840
the one place where you would do that is

00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:48,700
if you have a per project need for a

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,289
specific module version but you want to

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:54,850
use different module versions elsewhere

00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:56,320
you could still use you know I don't

00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,720
know if you needed a particular version

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,249
of DVI C for some reason in in one

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,139
project but you wanted to use a more

00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:09,210
recent version elsewhere local it would

00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:09,210
let you do that everybody else

00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:22,160
yes so the question was I am looking at

00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,110
the documentation for starting a new

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,930
module on Sipan and it doesn't say

00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,890
anything at all about pre pan I'm

00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,510
reasonably sure that the end those

00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:33,010
instructions that you're looking at are

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:37,540
probably like at least 10 years old oh

00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,540
really yes sir

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,250
they basically come by and scratch off

00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:52,580
the expires by date and put in a more

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:58,640
modern one then it actually changed the

00:19:52,580 --> 00:20:00,290
content of the yogurt cup so and this

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,330
man is showing me a picture of a beer

00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:04,670
right now so I think that means I'm done

00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,650
I'm happy to talk about any of this

00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,910
stuff further I will probably be

00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:09,910
