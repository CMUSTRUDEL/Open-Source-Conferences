so quick survey how many naughty

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,010
insectia Lee work remote right now okay

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,700
how many people would like to work

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:16,230
remote okay how many people think is a

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,960
horrible idea okay so hopefully we'll

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:24,420
convince those others that it's actually

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,099
very awesome to work removed I I have

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:32,160
been working remote approximately five

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:34,739
years and i really think that it can

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,980
offer a lot for an organization to work

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:42,690
remote it opens your organization up to

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,149
a wider market of talent and um with

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,300
that said it can also introduce some

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,890
challenges real quick caveat though as

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,530
i'm getting started i do want to mention

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,260
that i was asked to do this talk

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,440
literally three days ago so i have no

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,120
idea how long it's going to go oh so my

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,430
idea is once i get through this talk we

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,489
have time we may have lots of time for

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,200
some questions so here's the limit

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,170
here's a quote i found fairly

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,869
interesting remote work has opened the

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,479
door to a new era of freedom and luxury

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,509
a brave new world beyond the industrial

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,869
age belief in the office that's by Jason

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:26,640
pride and he works for one of the

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:27,720
founders for 37signals um as I said I've

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,840
been doing this for about five years

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:34,250
originally um I worked for shutterstock

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,310
I was one of the first remote employees

00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:41,240
currently at work as a team lead for

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:45,119
mediamath on one hundred percent remote

00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,399
and to kind of give a funny story about

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,860
my time at shutterstock they were they

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,479
were a little bit there let me just say

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,649
that maybe some of the company was kind

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,700
of thrilled with the idea of remote

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,750
workers and some of the company was a

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,610
little bit skeptical um and one of the

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,020
things they did just to make sure that

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,119
the remote employees were actually

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,340
working was they supplied us all with

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,280
iPads and had them

00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:10,519
constantly um so in some ways it was

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,780
good in some ways it was bad but I'd be

00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:14,420
literally be sitting on someone's desk

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,800
um and it would help with code pairing

00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,650
and what not going to meetings they

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,670
scare me around and one time I just left

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:24,049
it on and this they they went home

00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,480
because it was eastern time and I'm

00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:28,010
actually located in the west coast and

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,629
the cleaning lady was cleaning up the

00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,459
desk and I'm sitting there watching her

00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:32,780
clinging the desk and she looks over and

00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:34,489
she notices that's not a picture but

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,750
there's a moving face on there she

00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:37,310
immediately looks away and walks away

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:42,230
anyways it kind of freaked out the

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:43,760
cleaning lady so I think there's a

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,989
there's a number of the benefits for

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,420
working remote far outweigh the negative

00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:53,329
aspects of it both for the employee and

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:56,629
also for the organization the obvious

00:02:53,329 --> 00:03:00,140
first benefit is to me personally

00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:04,030
there's no commuting anymore I used to

00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:07,510
have a you know 40 to 50 minute commute

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:11,060
when i when i lived in portland and

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,380
that's a big drag i mean even if you

00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,959
can't if you do have the luxury to maybe

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,690
bike that's great but that is literally

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,900
you know two hours of your day that you

00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,489
lose right there now that i work remote

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,870
i mean it's just instantly i can just go

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:25,819
off and do whatever I need to do and

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,930
I've saved two hours two hours of

00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:33,919
daylight next advantage I could think of

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:36,620
his efficiency so for me personally I

00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:40,190
feel highly weight as a programmer I

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:42,590
feel way more efficient than I ever was

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,250
in the office in fact just as just an

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,540
antidote but when I do go to the office

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,599
in particular when I go to the office

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,700
which has an open floor plan my

00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:55,970
productivity just drops to almost

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:59,239
nothing is highly distracting especially

00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:02,110
for someone like me who I just needed I

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,180
need to be like have to block out sound

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,970
and it sounds your thing then working

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:10,630
remote it's a little making more

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:13,480
efficient the other great thing is you

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,490
could create your own office um if your

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,859
office if you work well on a coffee shop

00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,420
you can work in a coffee shop for myself

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:23,710
personally I have my own space set aside

00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:25,900
in my house I need to be away from

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:29,110
distractions but some people work great

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,780
in coffee shops but the nice thing is

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,390
you never have to worry about HR moving

00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,450
your desk or the way you have your

00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:40,990
things set up now of course there's

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:43,930
obviously some challenges one of the

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,910
first challenges that for me personally

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,510
this this actually is becoming more of

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:51,790
an issue as you go like long-term remote

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:54,460
isolation one of the things I mean I'm

00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:57,280
personally I'm an introvert and I can go

00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:02,430
long periods of time without actually

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:05,770
having interaction with with humans but

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,090
thankfully I have a family who who is

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,110
concerned about my mental health and

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,640
forces me to have some some interactions

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,550
and I think that if you're going to go

00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,260
remote it is a very good practice to get

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:22,960
involved in local user groups

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:24,250
hackerspaces your family whatever you

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,140
doesn't have to be a very often but as

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:31,780
much as you need and of course also just

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:35,169
having balance I think there's a

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,729
temptation in particular I know that

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,960
like as an organization they're worried

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:39,250
that remote workers are not working but

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,930
i think that the opposite tends to

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,229
happen in that remote workers tend to

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,720
work too much and there's not a clear

00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:48,669
line of wind to start and when to stop

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,880
because it's you're working at your

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:50,880
house

00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,810
I've become pretty militant about my

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,400
starting and stopping times I know

00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,560
there's always an exception to this and

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,450
that you you know they're there could be

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,230
an outage or something that you need to

00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:05,970
do on call but it's good to have kind of

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,360
a set time that people can see you

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:11,160
online no one you're available in

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,410
particular when you're working across

00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:19,740
multiple time zones or whatnot okay so

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:23,430
let's talk about having good tools so in

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,440
order to work remote I think it's

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,470
important that you have good software

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,630
tools and good hardware tools in order

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:33,900
to do your job professionally and

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:37,710
correctly probably the best tool in my

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,050
opinion that I use daily all the times

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,330
teammate I know that the others may use

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,650
other things like screen team-ups

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,290
whatever but teammate the big advantage

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,420
out for it is out of the box you can you

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,990
can do screen sharing like instantly

00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,130
through the terminal oh it's amazing the

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,590
biggest advantage to it I've actually

00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:58,170
have done interviews where I've had to

00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,910
do code pairing sessions um like I said

00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,740
I'm located in Oregon and I did an

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,740
interview with someone in in London at

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:08,120
one time and I could spend up a teammate

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,130
session on and it gives you an html5

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,780
client URL so you just send them that

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:16,620
URL and they can just connect through

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,990
the browser to your shell it's great if

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,550
you're really into pairing or code

00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,470
reviews you know where you're having

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:26,010
interactions it's just a perfect tool

00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:28,740
for that there are some security

00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,210
concerns with it and that it I might

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,410
think about website it explains it but

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,740
basically you can't spin up your own

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:37,520
server which we've done for it if you're

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,520
concerned about that

00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:43,930
screen hero I I don't know I've gone

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,840
through a number of tools for screen

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,450
sharing on screen hero seems to kind of

00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,060
hit the the nice spot if you

00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,710
particularly this is it doesn't all the

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,340
problem i have with most of these tools

00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:59,170
as the resolution is never that great so

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,330
it's good this is probably the best one

00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,520
in that if you need to interact with the

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:07,360
someone else's desktop i know that you

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,310
can also just use like there's all

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,740
there's VNC there's a number of other

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:15,270
ones out there this one here it seems

00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:17,710
like it's fairly popular these days um

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,880
it allows for some front-end pairing if

00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,850
you have to do some front-end pairing or

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:28,240
whatnot so that I use that most of the

00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:31,030
time so chat I think chat I mean

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,099
obviously chad is a huge deal when your

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,860
remote um I think if you're an

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:40,510
organization you're trying to have a

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:42,220
good robust remote culture that chat

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:46,780
should not be reserved to just the

00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:49,510
programmers um project managers keyway

00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:53,980
people sales people I think they should

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:57,430
all be on chat and I think that that

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,920
develops a culture just so it's just not

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,950
the programmers on the chat channel oh

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,430
and creating this sort of like isolation

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:10,690
between them and the and the rest of the

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:15,370
organization one of the things that we

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:18,580
do also a chat is we use hipchat but we

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:21,730
have a room just that is dedicated just

00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,770
for complaining we call it the head we

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,450
called the head to desk room um so

00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,520
there's an emoticon that does the head

00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,620
to desk so anything that frustrates you

00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:36,130
you can just type that emoticon in there

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:39,520
it's great um so when it comes to like

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:45,720
video chat on google hangouts is pretty

00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:49,050
good we also use blue jeans the

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,720
a pure in is a nice that's actually the

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:54,810
URL to it it's a nice like back up one

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,550
and I think it's just using that the

00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,529
open source I can remember it's called a

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,110
top my head right now but it's built in

00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:03,000
the chrome and you just like typing that

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:09,389
URL and you're not instantly inside this

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,560
like hangout type environment obviously

00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:13,680
I think you need to have great equipment

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,240
um if you're an organization that wants

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,420
to do the remote thing you shouldn't

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,829
expect your employees to I mean

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,480
personally I like my own computers but

00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:23,250
you shouldn't expect them to you know

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,769
the pony up for the nice desk that

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:29,579
everybody in the office has or you know

00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:33,000
the computers and whatnot so they should

00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:36,300
they should have all of the computers

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,329
that they need and hardware and I also

00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,160
highly recommend having an iPad both

00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:43,319
sides the nice thing about the ipad is

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,050
that you can you can have facetime

00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:47,670
running um if you're in a meeting and

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,399
still be connected your computer without

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:54,089
having to really think about switching

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,970
around on your desktop okay so now let's

00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:57,959
talk a little bit about leading so this

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,850
is where you're sort of level up a

00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:04,949
little bit um i'm not i mean i am a team

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,389
lead i am not an expert when it comes to

00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:09,089
leadership and this is not like a

00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:10,319
leadership talk my personal view is i'm

00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:15,720
a bit of an anarchist when it comes to

00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:17,569
leadership all but and I also kind of

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,589
feel like it's my responsible

00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:20,879
responsibilities will lead to basically

00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:25,379
do all the things that nobody else wants

00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:27,500
to do so and the first primary thing is

00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:29,309
you want to advocate for your team

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,110
particularly when you're working with a

00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:35,279
number of remote people across various

00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:37,259
time zones um you you want to take on

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,750
the role of thinking about what what

00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:41,910
might be painful for them um like if

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:45,809
some somebody in New York sets up a

00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:47,819
meeting at 6am west coast time it's a

00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:49,470
good thing to step in and remind those

00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:50,579
people that hey there's a remote people

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,709
you might want to schedule this for

00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,509
another time work with your project

00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:57,990
managers to make sure that we're getting

00:11:54,509 --> 00:12:00,280
enough time to work on tech debt

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:03,970
any sort of open source things that we

00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,800
find interesting so just just advocate

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,640
from a technical perspective I think a

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:12,220
good team lead would do that the one on

00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,720
one this is highly valuable not just for

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,510
your directs but for everybody if you

00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,700
remote I have I have basically I have

00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,430
worked out a system where I set up all

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,050
my meetings on a Monday and for the most

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,840
part so I have the rest of the week

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,490
clean clear but I set up all these

00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,010
one-on-ones with various folks and I

00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,390
think it's great just for with people

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,420
who are not my direct but also just

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,710
people that I work with just to kind of

00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,890
keep kind of your ear to the ground

00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:40,240
what's going on within the organization

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,890
it's a great strategy and I recommend

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,550
that you just just standing up one on

00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:47,170
one so that you can I think a good lead

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:53,110
would want to know what's going on

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:55,540
organizationally taco so taco is a

00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,280
meeting that we have weekly which is

00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,100
tech only I have no idea why we call it

00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,750
taco I think it's because another team

00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,560
had a meeting they call the burrito so

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:07,570
we we went with taco basically it's just

00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,760
a 20 to 30-minute meeting that we have

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,380
once a week only text no project

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,560
managers nobody to have any sort of

00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:17,580
insight or say in anything so we can

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:22,440
basically just talk about struggles

00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:24,520
technical issues things that you know

00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,500
interesting projects whatever there's no

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:31,150
agenda but it's just set aside for that

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,680
okay so let's talk about like having

00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,650
hard conversations so one of the things

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,080
is when you're a lead um you know you're

00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:41,770
doing code reviews or whatever you know

00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:44,580
opinions there's strong opinions I mean

00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:48,550
coding is a very it's a personal thing

00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:51,880
and so how do you have those those

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:54,190
conversations and I think the worst

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:58,180
thing you can do is sometimes just doing

00:13:54,190 --> 00:14:00,220
it over email my personal take is if the

00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,540
conversation is not happening the way

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,530
you think it should be happening you

00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,870
should take it a step closer so if email

00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:09,330
is breaking down if

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:11,990
chad is breaking down and you know but

00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:16,980
it's time to just do screen time and

00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:19,830
talking to the person and also just work

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,270
on preventing triangulating which is

00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,430
sort of the opposite thing sometimes

00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:25,620
people will vent to you without actually

00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:28,440
talking to a person directly maybe

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,029
having an issue with certain particular

00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,980
code opinion or whatever encourage

00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:34,140
people to be talking in the room be

00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,650
talking directly to each other these

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:40,020
sorts of things kind of common sense

00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:42,089
quarterly meetings highly in Portland

00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,480
important it doesn't happen quarterly

00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:47,839
could be twice a year using you could

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,230
also use a conference to get together

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,990
but i think the in-person meeting is

00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:58,290
highly important and it should be

00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,970
encouraged pairing so this is a little

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,520
bit of a controversial thing or can be

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:08,250
depending on how it's done i am not an

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:10,050
advocate of like mandating pairing i am

00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:14,160
an advocate of encouraging it I'm

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:16,490
advocate of basically especially around

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,680
code reviews I one of the things that I

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:22,740
cannot well I can never really code

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,190
review well is when you know you get a

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,540
giant some epic the developers been

00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:30,420
working on for two to three months and

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,940
then they drop in a pull request and

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,160
they just want a single thumbs up that

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,660
is I don't think that's a great way of

00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,950
doing code reviews and I think pairing

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:46,980
is a great way to spread the knowledge

00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:49,970
gain some understanding and again I it's

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:54,500
something that I think that a lead could

00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:58,200
demonstrate a good way of doing that and

00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:01,830
then finally if you like working remote

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:05,760
you like challenges I work for mediamath

00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:10,339
and we want you so come talk to me we're

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,339
taking resumes thank you and

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:20,110
and now I think I have a little bit of

00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:21,850
time so um if you have any suggestions

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,749
or comments or questions about things

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,749
that work for you yeah

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,819
like we have

00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,820
because last brain what we had together

00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:01,939
you

00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,939
really hurt

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,230
absolutely I think everyone heard him I

00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:15,810
don't know how to repeat that but I

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,810
agree with everything there yeah

00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:45,980
sure um unfortunately than i work i have

00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:47,450
i have a really awesome boss I'm no idea

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,559
I have no idea if he's actually watching

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:57,889
but um yeah so I mean basically I have a

00:17:51,559 --> 00:18:01,490
weekly 101 with him oh and I mean really

00:17:57,889 --> 00:18:03,619
I mean he's he's really how I integrated

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:07,820
with him it's mainly is through that

00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:09,379
one-on-one and then through chat I mean

00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,600
that's how we work together it's not

00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:15,860
it's not really anything there's not a

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,539
lot of anything really weird about it or

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:21,529

00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:28,570
question at all but yeah yeah get an
