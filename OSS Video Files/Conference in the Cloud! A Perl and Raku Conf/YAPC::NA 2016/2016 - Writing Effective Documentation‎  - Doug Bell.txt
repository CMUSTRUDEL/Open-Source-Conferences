um okay so that works all right so high

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:15,000
and this is a effective documentation

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,109
talk as I was saying earlier I really

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,830
wanted to call this efficient

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,080
documentation but I wasn't sure that was

00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,000
quite going to get people in the door I

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,619
shouldn't worried because documentation

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,179
is a terrible topic and nobody ever

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:34,890
wants to talk about it so let's pretend

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:37,829
that you're a new developer hi welcome

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,670
to the team you're going to come in and

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,180
you're going to have a bunch of

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,320
questions the code you're going to look

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,100
at the code and the code is going to

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,719
answer how the system works the tests

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,399
you're going to look at your tests if

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,230
you have any and it's going to tell you

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,079
what that code is supposed to be doing

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,930
and then you're going to look at the

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,699
docks and they're going to answer why

00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:03,329
why does that code exists why does that

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:06,720
file exists why am I using this specific

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:09,450
method to do this specific thing and why

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,270
is the most important question that we

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,689
have to answer about our code without

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,850
why we can't improve our code we can't

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:21,270
refactor our code and we can't

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,790
revitalize our code if we code without

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:29,549
knowing why we are simply creating

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:33,540
technical debt so what can you do to

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:36,329
write better documentation first and

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,729
foremost to communicate you require an

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,619
audience there are quite a few different

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,380
kinds of audiences that might be looking

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,810
at your documentation first obviously

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,420
you have yourself this our docs you

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,369
right for you by you you're an

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,170
experienced developer you've been all

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,360
through this code you've written most of

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,490
this code and so you have to have

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,490
documentation to remind yourself as to

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,140
what you were thinking at the time we've

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,930
got new developers the new members of

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,270
our team they've got questions and the

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,250
docs are going to have to write answers

00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,110
often the documentation is the first

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,110
thing that any new developer is going to

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,510
see in your code

00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,280
and so these documentation has to be

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,620
complete correct and make a good

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,350
impression anybody who comes into a new

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:23,520
code base and you've got docs that are

00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:25,360
out of date incorrect or even incomplete

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,760
they're going to get a very low opinion

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,900
of your code and they're going to have

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,360
to double-check they're going to get

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,340
very frustrated indeed that's one of the

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,770
biggest frustrations I have with any new

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:40,690
project I ever join or start and then

00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,430
you've got your users your code can't

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,740
help them because they're never going to

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,810
look at the code in fact they're often

00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,830
going to be using the web documentation

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,239
they're going to go to med asleep and

00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,040
they're going to go to searched at Sipan

00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,530
org because that's where google tells

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,270
them to go and they're just going to

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,880
read your documentation and so your

00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,620
documentation has to fill the role of

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,540
user documentation developer

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,350
documentation and power user

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,540
documentation so there are some

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,850
requirements to an effective

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,070
documentation that to kind of get the

00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:15,790
most out of what time we're able to

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:18,280
spend on writing these docs if you can

00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,170
just achieve these minimum documentation

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,860
you'll be doing far better than most

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:27,640
projects first and foremost every single

00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:30,880
file needs an abstract this is a quick

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,450
description it's one line basically the

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,340
too long didn't read version and it goes

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,070
yeah ask the answers the question am I

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,380
on the right file and it goes right up

00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,709
at the top and it's the first thing seen

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,709
so basically first line of your file or

00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:52,180
second line that's fine should be the

00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:54,070
abstract this is what this file does the

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:58,930
next thing that goes up is the synopsis

00:03:54,070 --> 00:04:02,470
and it's our code example this is what

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,480
real world usage looks like so for

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,130
example if you've got a command line

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,660
program your synopsis is going to be

00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:11,110
invocation of the command line program

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:13,120
if you've got an object class you're

00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,579
going to show how to instantiate and how

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,200
to use some methods of this class if

00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:20,340
you've got a rule you're going to see

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,340
how to compose the rule

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,350
and this also goes right up on top I

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,930
should mention right now that these are

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,419
opinions i am i'm willing to brooke

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,729
discussion of the opinions at the end

00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:35,800
but these are this is what's worked for

00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:37,870
me over all these things that i've tried

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:43,090
and i'll go into the things that don't

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:45,789
work at the end next up after our

00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,800
synopsis we have a description and this

00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:52,259
is where we get into the overview this

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:55,060
is the long form as long as we need to

00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:58,630
understand where this file fits into our

00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:01,870
project so this is going to be a couple

00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:05,110
paragraphs at the very least and it's

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,570
what i need to understand this file so

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,509
this will actually also have to define

00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:14,979
our terms i wrote a project recently

00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:17,800
about ipmi which is a integrated power

00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:19,990
management interface I couldn't even

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,669
tell you but I did document in the

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,770
documentation so when I forget that

00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,479
acronym that I don't know I'll be able

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,880
to look it up there's also a bunch of

00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:32,560
other acronyms BMC backboard baseboard

00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:35,320
management console and a couple others

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,789
that I'm going to forget and that's why

00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:42,099
I keep them right in the file right

00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:47,710
where I need them and this obviously

00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:49,659
goes on top and finally kind of a weird

00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,909
one to put up there is the see also

00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:55,380
section but I really really like this

00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:58,750
because it tells me related information

00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,699
it tells me where to go next but it also

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:04,330
tells me where I should have come from

00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:07,090
so if I've got for example a role or a

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,099
base class all my individual classes

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,680
will link back to that base class saying

00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:14,110
here this thing extends this base class

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,820
you need to know all this first before

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:22,020
you can understand the code that's in

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:24,280
this file and willing docs are essential

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,930
those people who are losing the web

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,300
interface to look at your documentation

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,190
are going to when they come across the

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,190
term they don't know they're going to

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,190
want to look it up

00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,690
if you can just have it show up blue and

00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,970
they click on it and go to the place

00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:41,420
where it defines it they'll be much

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:44,120
better off when it comes to using your

00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,880
editor and following links I know them

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,510
if you use the go file function that

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,670
will mostly work I have to this day not

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:56,150
realize how to get back from the go file

00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:58,340
function but I imagine there's a way

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,980
that I'm just not good enough to l I

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:05,480
don't know about any other editors but

00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:11,120
find a replay or using search is is will

00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:15,230
help so this also goes on top I know the

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,000
prevailing best practices put things

00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,220
like this at the bottom but I'll get

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,760
into why I don't ever put documentation

00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,890
at the bottom a little later so all this

00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,200
stuff goes up at the top of the file if

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:30,020
you work a newspaper or the web you'll

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,030
notice as above the fold basically this

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,740
is when I open the file for the first

00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,470
time my editor is going to put me right

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,810
up at the top and at the top I can then

00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,669
see here's where everything is if I ever

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,140
get confused if I'm ever halfway through

00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,790
the file and I don't remember something

00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,230
I can get right up to the top of the

00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,780
file all I got to do is click two

00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:53,390
buttons and I can see all the

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:56,660
documentation that I need so this is a

00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,430
kind of a basic default of the

00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,030
documentation on the top of every module

00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,500
I've written for the last two years

00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,000
before that I was doing very terrible

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,240
things and I really got to go back and

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,860
fix all that but it's hard and it's

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,870
documentation and I don't like doing it

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:16,310
but apparently writing and talk about

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,810
documentation and giving it isn't as

00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:24,520
hard as actually writing documentation

00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:24,520
itself so that's why I'm here ok yeah

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:30,680
so for users this stuff at the top will

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:33,470
answer the basics of why the synopsis

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,840
will tell me what the code does some

00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,580
comments up there will tell you why the

00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,580
abstract tells me immediately whether or

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,770
not I'm in the right place at all and we

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:46,280
get a full description that builds a

00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:48,020
narrative of why this code exists for

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,540
new devs we get to open the file we

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,400
immediately see the docs this is

00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,740
important because going to search for

00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,790
the docs like getting to the top of file

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,680
on getting the bottom the file are

00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,960
really really easy but if your docs

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,660
starts halfway through and then go to

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,740
the end finding out where that token is

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:08,840
are using the untoten are you using the

00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,200
some other data token at the bottom do I

00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:16,430
know I probably don't know it's hard to

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:21,080
find and Doc's are defined aren't very

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:23,890
helpful so for experienced doves this

00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,630
gives us always know what to search for

00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,670
so we always know that our talks are at

00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:31,160
the top so if we change something in the

00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,960
module we can go read at the top change

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,270
your documentation and move on with our

00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:40,730
day we don't have to again go searching

00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:42,260
for them so this is so that was the

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,560
module documentation so every module

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:48,890
requires a headpiece that has those four

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:52,760
sections right up at the top but also we

00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:56,780
have methods attributes and other things

00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:00,350
sub routines etc interspace throughout

00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:02,030
our code but same as before we're going

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:06,770
to have a bunch of sections that go

00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:09,350
above that code so we've got a name you

00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:11,180
may be using head to I actually use pod

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:14,660
Weaver from my code which makes this a

00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:18,050
lot simpler i'll digress a little bit to

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,970
say that pod is kind of terrible it is

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,700
kind of annoying it has no structure

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:27,020
about which we put on it which is why

00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:29,780
i'm giving this talk but pod Weaver can

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,210
take our bad pod and turn it into

00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,080
something a little easier to work with

00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:38,550
and I can answer any questions on that

00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,530
maybe after the talk so after a name we

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,560
have a synopsis again this again is

00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:46,050
going to tell us how to use our code it

00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,700
will tell us our return value it'll tell

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,390
us how to invoke the method and what

00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,520
arguments it takes this is just going to

00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,810
tell you how to use it because in our

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,450
description we're going to explain what

00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,940
those are this is where things like

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,500
javadoc j/s doc and pie doc will save

00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,020
like little fields that allows you to

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,910
say it takes in this type it exports

00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,180
this type we unfortunately don't get

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,950
that we have to use English and nobody

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,380
ever says in the job description of

00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,990
programming that you need to be

00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,310
communicating in English quite a lot but

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,520
it turns out that is actually one of the

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:23,850
most important skills that we can get

00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,620
and to see also so often in a method

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,720
you're going to need I'll see this other

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,220
method to get input for this method or

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,570
see this other method for what to do

00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:35,190
with the output of this method so

00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:38,600
everything one of my methods looks

00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:41,430
approximately like this I've got a name

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:47,220
my synopsis my description and then

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:51,020
finally my coat and this goes above the

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,020
method so I immediately know where it is

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:59,910
so these are a bunch of things that I've

00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:03,060
done the past that have just totally not

00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:06,720
worked for me these are a lot of best

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:08,460
practices I've seen coming around and

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,460
we've tried them in projects and it

00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:14,940
turns out that they are not actually

00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:18,870
that good specifically this one first

00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:22,230
and foremost I see a lot of people still

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,660
even giving this talk that like to put

00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,730
their docks at the bottom the problem

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,580
here is that first and foremost they're

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,070
hidden from users so going out and I got

00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,770
a search for where the first start of my

00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:39,180
documentation is and that can be hard to

00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:42,960
do and since it's hidden from you it's

00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:45,450
also never going to be updated so all

00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,819
these docs are out of sight safely

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,489
stored away and

00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:51,319
good kind of when you're trying to edit

00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:52,339
the code but when you're trying to

00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:55,100
remind yourself to update the

00:12:52,339 --> 00:13:00,769
documentation having them out of sight

00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:02,089
is not a good thing alphabetizing one of

00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:06,109
the projects I used to be on wood

00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:08,119
alphabetize all of their methods for

00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:10,789
organizational sake and it turns out

00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:12,829
that alphabetizing doesn't really form a

00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:14,449
narrative well so if i'm reading this

00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:16,039
file from top to bottom i'm a new user

00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:20,029
I've never seen this file before in my

00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:21,259
life it's better to start out with these

00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,910
are the things that I need to know right

00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:25,129
away these are the methods I need to

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,689
call and then here are some helper

00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:28,489
methods that I may or may not need to

00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:30,499
call and finally here are the private

00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:32,029
methods that I probably just need to

00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:35,989
know about if I'm only going to work on

00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:42,589
the code so for example here read this

00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:46,160
book in alphabetical order this is the

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:51,079
starship titanic book which was douglas

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,729
adams and terry gilliam if you want to

00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:55,729
actually read this book for free in

00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:57,259
alphabetical order and just in case you

00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:58,819
actually want to write a book in

00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:01,999
alphabetical order here is the code that

00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:03,559
will do that for you I however do not

00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:06,279
recommend writing your docs in

00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:06,279
alphabetical order

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,540
one of the biggest things that we do as

00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,090
programmers is try not to repeat

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,770
ourselves we don't repeat ourselves but

00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,390
it turns out that not repeating

00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,870
yourselves in that Doc's is a terrible

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,340
thing Doc's are allowed to repeat

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,860
ourselves indeed English communication

00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,890
even in this presentation I've repeated

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,450
myself quite a bit it allows us if we

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,340
skip something if we miss something if

00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:36,930
we don't quite understand something to

00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:41,690
pick it up again later because we've

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:44,400
repeated it methods can have assumptions

00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,950
we can link to those assumptions which

00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,690
is a good solution we can repeat them

00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,540
which is kind of a better solution

00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:54,210
they're right there or we can link and

00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,860
repeat to them so we can say here's this

00:14:54,210 --> 00:15:00,330
assumption if you need to know more

00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:03,450
click on this link and don't forget

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:06,930
private methods I know quite a few

00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:08,100
developers and myself who say that

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,670
private methods don't need to be

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,200
documented this is totally obvious from

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:16,710
context what this private method is

00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:19,980
doing the private method should follow

00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:23,130
the exact same rules except you can use

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,290
them as comments instead so you can you

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,020
know give it a name explain how to use

00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:31,050
it explain what it does and why it helps

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:35,700
but don't show it to the end users the

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:39,780
end users don't need to know about it so

00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:43,530
as an overview here the docs are

00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:45,390
answering why and the why is the most

00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:48,510
important question than anybody needs to

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:50,580
know about our code so make them useful

00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,410
and remember who's going to be looking

00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,210
at them I try to get into the mind of

00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,520
the people who are trying to look at

00:15:54,210 --> 00:16:00,330
them I know that's actually one of the

00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:02,820
hardest things for me i will write pages

00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,290
and pages of documentation and upon

00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,560
editing them i'll go back and say oh

00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:09,360
well you wait I've written this thing

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,220
assuming that they know this I need an

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,420
entire paragraph above this to explain

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:18,360
what this concept is make them easy to

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,220
find so that you can edit them so that

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:27,510
people can find them

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:27,510
and do we have any questions yeah

00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:50,699
so yeah so when comparing putting all

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,949
the methods up at the top with the rest

00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:54,870
of the documentation or having the

00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:59,459
methods the method documentation

00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:02,129
interspersed i prefer interspersed so I

00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:03,449
mean people use their editors

00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:07,439
differently first and foremost but when

00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:09,360
i use my editor i search for the / sub

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,339
and then the name of the sub and that

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,650
brings me right to the the definition of

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:15,179
the code and then I know that

00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,620
immediately above that is the

00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,510
documentation and then immediately below

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:23,610
that is the definition of this

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:25,230
subroutine and in Perl we don't have we

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:28,079
don't have any any formatting

00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,679
requirements for our docs but in Python

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,179
and in Java and a lot of other languages

00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:36,000
there is actually no question you must

00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:40,049
absolutely put your documentation above

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,490
or inside your method and so for both

00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:43,740
for programmers coming from those other

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,510
languages and for me personally knowing

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:48,240
exactly where the method Docs is I

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:52,830
prefer to keep the method docs in or

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:55,830
interlaced in between my co-workers have

00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:58,559
seen this talk and they have been

00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:02,490
converted though they do continually rib

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,830
me for making them skip documentation as

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,770
they use you know the arrow keys to go

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:10,250
all the way down through their code so

00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:17,870
it's a battle that I'm fighting and

00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:17,870
hopefully I might win sorry

00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:34,110
so yeah so that's pod Weaver and I use

00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:37,080
that I love that like as I was saying

00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:40,470
for it allows me to do things that pod

00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,840
was not capable of doing it allows me to

00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,610
just declare this as a method and then

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,620
it'll collect all the methods together

00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,440
so that even if I have you know

00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,360
functions and methods interspersed

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,759
functions being things that are exported

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,629
by my module which why is an object

00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,950
exporting we won't get into that but

00:18:56,629 --> 00:19:01,049
being able to define them in a code

00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,580
differently from how their their spit

00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:06,120
out in the web documentation is actually

00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,649
very helpful for me because it allows me

00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,769
to keep them right there with the method

00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:12,659
and then yes at the end they're all put

00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:14,009
together down at the bottom and then new

00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:18,690
sections are added that I don't have to

00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:20,700
update so I enjoy pod Weaver I use dis

00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:25,139
Zilla but I know that not everybody does

00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:27,899
so I wrote a command-line tool that

00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:30,120
allow you to use pod Weaver which

00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:36,600
unfortunately I haven't linked to so I'm

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:38,370
going to have to show that but yes I

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,669
definitely recommend if you can pod

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,669
Weaver

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,789
suggestions for tools the markdown

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,740
yes there is yeah there is actually some

00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:04,010
tools for doing mark down in your pod

00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:09,530
Enki I believe wrote our wrote a tool

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:15,860
for this he also wrote tool for jjs doc

00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:17,030
the at symbols here is here's command

00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,550
line program that while you use pot

00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,340
Weaver I haven't released this yet I

00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,870
will plan to i want to talk to Ricardo

00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,870
to see if we can get it included in pod

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:31,360
Weaver itself or if I have to make my

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:37,340
own app which I will so but it turns out

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:40,400
it's not trivial to do but with this

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,370
command line program it is I am out of

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,800
time so if you have any other questions

00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:51,820
