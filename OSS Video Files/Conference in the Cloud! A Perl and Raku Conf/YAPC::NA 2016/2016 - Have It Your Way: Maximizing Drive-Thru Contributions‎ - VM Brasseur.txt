so um if you're not here for have it

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,899
your way maximizing drive through

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,830
contributions you are in the wrong room

00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:13,440
but you probably already figured that

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:15,509

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,810
virtual machine jokes they've gotten old

um you might know me from the internets

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,119

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,110
wednesday from my talk which is an

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,430
introduction to IRC and here's my email

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,790
address should you like to kick it

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,890
old-school that way um I am currently a

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,050
senior software engineering manager at

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,460
Hewlett Packard Enterprise I work in

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,350
service to a team which is a hundred

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,809
percent dedicated to upstream

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,850
open-source development I work with

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,850
someone most of you know and love her

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,829
name is Allison Randall so I work with

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,629
allison and i want to take a moment to

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,670
thank HP for allowing me to be here

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:09,930
today and for supporting open source as

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:11,159
much as it does thank you i will

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,270
actually send that to me a team they'll

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,600
be very happy to hear that we're getting

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,189
applause um so uh as i mentioned i am a

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,570
manager so i'm going to do something we

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,299
call and management setting up

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,580
expectations this is what we're going to

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,439
cover in my going to stalk start

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,290
with a definition of drive through as

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,850
far as in the context of this specific

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:35,040
talk um some of the disadvantages I have

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,240
heard about drive-throughs then because

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,070
I'm bias I'm going to spend a lot of

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,220
time on the advantages of drive-throughs

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,350
and why you should care and then finally

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,490
how to maximize them how to get more

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:52,320
drive thrus in your project what I'm not

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,939
going to cover is how to convert a drive

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,090
through into a repeating contributor

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,860
this is a very very important topic it's

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,600
one for another talk it is out of scope

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,420
of this talk i already have to shave off

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,790
about 10 15 minutes on this stop without

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,530
adding this in so i will not cover that

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,899
however a lot of the things i will

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,530
discuss for maximizing drive-throughs

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,930
also help to make

00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:17,260
contributors sticky so they might come

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:20,590
back and finally please save your

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,060
questions and trolling until the end so

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,620
let's get started with those definitions

00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,150
to lay some groundwork for the remainder

00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:30,910
of the conversation here first of all

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:34,540
for a contribution for the purposes of

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,180
this talk a contribution is anything

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,430
which can be checked into source control

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,080
there are so many other ways that people

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,510
can contribute to open source projects

00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,090
there's project management there's

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,830
community management there's just so

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,350
many other ways that you can do this but

00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,320
those will require a lot more commitment

00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,580
to a project and therefore by definition

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,610
will almost never be done by a

00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:00,190
drive-thru contributor who show up and

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,050
then leave a contributor therefore is

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,330
anybody who makes a contribution to your

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,100
source control thing with documentation

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,620
or design or what have you and I Drive

00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,989
through shows up makes one patch and

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:15,340
then bugs out you never hear from them

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:17,040
again so I'm going to go into these a

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,060
little in a little more detail

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,739
specifically the contributions and

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,200
contributors and tell you more about

00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:25,239
them so uh give you something

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,959
characteristics of these I ran a survey

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:31,209
on Twitter and in a lot of research to

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,370
get not just my perception but the

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,590
entire open source communities

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,140
perception of drive through contributors

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,640
and contributions what follows the rest

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,000
of the content is based upon that

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,850
research so let's start with

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,290
contributions because they're easy to be

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,290
honest so we'll just get it out of the

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,780
way contributions come in many shapes

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,190
and forms but my research showed that it

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,590
really falls into four different

00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:00,070
categories when people come through for

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:03,609
a drive-thru contribution it's often a

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,750
self-service get in get out just pick

00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:07,900
something because you can't wait for

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:10,239
someone else to do it their work related

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,250
they need to fix this bug in order to

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,380
get their job done and that's all they

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,329
need and then they move on it's a

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,880
special project or a work or a use case

00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:21,269
let's say you happen to be a Commodore

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,449
64 aficionado

00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,699
and you really need moves to run on it

00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:27,840
so you make a little patch a little

00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,310
patch I'm sure that's all that would be

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,389
and then you submit it and then you

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,060
leave because you've gotten what you

00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:34,740
need and then there are documentation

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,270
addition and fixes this is the

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,310
overwhelming majority of them because

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,900
they are typically relatively easy to

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,659
make you don't have to set up a dev

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:46,830
environment to do them most of the time

00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:48,210
so that's contributions drive your

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,909
contributions and the categories they

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,460
fall into contributors because we are

00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:55,740
all complicated squishy little things

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,220
called humans are not as easy to

00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,949
categorize so instead I asked some

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,900
questions why do you drive through a

00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,250
contributor show up at all they do

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,479
otherwise they wouldn't be a

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,389
drive-through contributed they'd just be

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,009
a dried five right no but they paused

00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:12,750
long enough to pick up their hamburger

00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:15,240
and then they got up so why do they show

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,880
up well most commonly they do have that

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,530
itch to scratch it's just one thing that

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,240
they can't wait for someone else to do

00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:26,130
they just need it done they do it

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:28,830
themselves sometimes people are unable

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,840
or unwilling to find a different project

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,900
and so they have to deal with yours what

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,380
they learn they like it or not say they

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,940
are really they really really would

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,919
rather use mojolicious but they're in a

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,669
dancer shop or maybe they're in a dancer

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,400
shop and they would rather use

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:46,110
mojolicious either way they have to use

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,840
it a project they would rather not use

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:52,199
so you know they fix it they get going

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:55,050
and often they like you they really

00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,960
really like you OMG i want to give you

00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,539
all my time and all my energy but i

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,219
don't have very much so i'm just going

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,370
to do one thing so i can feel I've

00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:06,900
contributed to a project i really love

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,849
so that's you know that's pretty obvious

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,580
that's probably not mind-blowing to most

00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:13,229
of you but why do they leave and this is

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,930
something a lot of projects don't have a

00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:18,900
lot of insight into but they do have

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,669
some obviously people scratch their edge

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,800
they don't care about your project

00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,569
they're not emotionally invested into in

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,650
it at all so they fix what they need and

00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:31,280
then they get out but more often they

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,620
make one and then they don't have time

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,170
to make another there are a lot of

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,540
things in this world which you can

00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,250
budget but time is one of those that

00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,340
once you spend it out of your budget it

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,290
never comes back we all have lives some

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,080
of us have families I have some really

00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,480
demanding cats so um I just don't have

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,490
time to otherwise contribute to projects

00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,930
and this is pretty common for driving

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,110
contributors as well they have to move

00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,660
on with their lives and put them time

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,780
elsewhere sometimes they stopped using

00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,860
their projects sometimes they do

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,190
relocate to another job and they just

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,780
don't need your project anymore

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:11,090
sometimes something newer and hotter and

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,000
cooler comes up and they switch to that

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,620
instead so yeah they're naturally not

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,669
going to contribute again they're not

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,050
even using your project unfortunately

00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:23,690
more often it's really hard to

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,030
contribute as I said time once you spend

00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:28,910
it it's gone these are people who

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:31,220
invested a lot of time and effort to

00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,340
give you a patch and it just wasn't

00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:38,750
worth it for them so they're not going

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:41,750
to invest that time again other times

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,270
they're not appreciated they will submit

00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:47,450
a patch to you and you won't even say

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,789
thank you you won't even put a little

00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:52,250
comment in your PR saying hey Chris

00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:53,300
thanks for that and then merge it it'll

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,479
get merged but it might get merged

00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,120
silently people's names will never end

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,160
up in a contributors file and that

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,220
really makes them feel like crap I spent

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:07,900
all this time and you can't even say

00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:10,070
thanks dude it takes 10 seconds and

00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:16,010
unfortunately more important than that

00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:18,800
even is um I'm very sorry to

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,060
say sometimes they show up they do what

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,600
they need to do and then they get out

00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:28,130
because your project harbors

00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,979
and assholery so rudeness dismissive

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,060
comments these drive people away

00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:33,620
contributors will show up and then never

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:37,219
get back because they don't need to take

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:39,919
that abuse some of the respondents to my

00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:43,370
survey said that core contributors took

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,209
credit for their work that's assholery

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,889
that's not

00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:48,259
cool another said they couldn't stand

00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:50,600
the snark Club attitude people would

00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:52,269
just mean to each other and that's the

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,639
way the culture of that particular

00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:58,009
community just happened to be but this

00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:03,199
contributor didn't need that and so they

00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:05,990
left so um some of the people who are

00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:11,269
 towards drive-thru contributors

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:12,470
in particular they express contempt for

00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:14,209
these drives for contributors and they

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,179
use it as kind of a rationalization for

00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:18,879
the rude and dismissive behavior I don't

00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:22,339
agree with these people full disclosure

00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:25,670
but it is fair to get their opinions out

00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:29,319
there so i will say that one complained

00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:32,269
that they had is that it takes time

00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:35,240
these people show up they ask for help

00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:37,749
you give your time to help them

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,490
contribute and then they never come back

00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:41,809
so therefore i'm going to get really

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,209
angry with them because i feel i have

00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:45,860
wasted in my time okay that's their

00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,959
opinion my opinion is you still have

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,439
their contribution and isn't that what

00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:54,350
you really need it to begin with so um

00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:57,019
that's my answer to that they reply but

00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,959
these people aren't community so why do

00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:01,910
I have to be nice to them why do I have

00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:04,129
to spend time on them because they're

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,679
not going to stick around and so these

00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:08,420
organizers often resent drive through

00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:10,220
contributors because there is no chance

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,540
of them becoming community members and

00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,689
nor will they be if they keep being

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,639
 anyway this is what they say

00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:18,439
and that's because a lot of these

00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,480
project organizers visualize their

00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:22,819
projects this way so this is what

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,170
happens when you give a woman and iPad

00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:28,610
pro and a pencil and she think she can

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:31,970
draw so so what they doing is they're

00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:35,360
seeing community here as the foundation

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,220
of their project and above that you have

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,629
contributors and above that you have the

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,220
core contributors who are making a lot

00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:42,499
of the design and architectural

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,839
decisions community becomes valued over

00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:47,720
all things now don't get me wrong i

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,790
really really love community I mean so

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,829
much I spend so much of my time talking

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,450
about community and helping people with

00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:57,020
community I really love it like

00:10:53,450 --> 00:11:00,530
everything I can to foster it but this

00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:02,410
is the way it actually works this is the

00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:05,240
actual hierarchy for most projects is

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,560
you have contributors and that clipped

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,520
off i'll have to fix that in the next

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,170
Rev so you have contributors and once

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,000
you have contributors then you can build

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,410
community using them if you don't have

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,930
contributors you can never have

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,610
community or as Carl Fogle says the

00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:23,930
contribution Trump's the compete

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:27,410
contributor so despite this and the fact

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:30,560
that without contributors it is

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:32,510
impossible to have community a lot of

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,250
community organizers and project

00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,870
organizers act with a lot of hostility

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,570
towards drive-throughs because they'll

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,010
never be contributors our they'll never

00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:44,150
be community members and I think they're

00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:50,900
wrong so therefore I'm going to take a

00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:54,140
drink its water unfortunately um so I

00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:56,090
have a modest proposal to make that is

00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:59,000
an ever increasing number of drive-thru

00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:01,490
contributors is one possible sign of a

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,740
healthy project a project with few

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,290
drive-thru contributors may not be

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,240
healthy contrary to drive through

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,160
contributors being burdensome they are

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,880
one of the best things that can happen

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,290
to your project this number the number

00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,170
of drive-thru contributors can be an

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:20,930
incredibly valuable metric for project

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,450
help so if you have more drive for

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,760
contributors it's a sign of certain

00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,490
things and when it's a sign of is that

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,670
more people are looking at your project

00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:33,080
when people are looking at your project

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:35,540
that they are able to contribute and

00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,290
then get out so quickly is a validation

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:40,340
of your contribution process and

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,370
therefore more people are able to

00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:46,190
contribute to your project and therefore

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,940
if you got more contributors you have

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:51,020
the potential for more community members

00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:54,680
so aside from this there are a lot of

00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:58,150
more tangible and very specific

00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,150
advantages to your project

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,910
first of all you will have an improved

00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,410
process if you have a lot of drive your

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,620
contributors you have improved your

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,810
process to foster them it means that

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,510
your process is open clear direct and

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,820
unambiguous and if you processes open

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:18,880
clear direct and unambiguous then so are

00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,620
your channels of communications which is

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,540
really key because we as humans in

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,430
general have a very hard time

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,770
communicating and we don't put enough

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,640
effort into it but you have because

00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:31,060
you've got a lot of drive through

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,650
contributors you also end up with a lot

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,940
of improved numbers and numbers are

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,550
really great and I get into numbers a

00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:39,700
bit more further on first of all you

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,050
will have more contributors duh because

00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,210
you've got all these drive-throughs

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,730
coming by which means you also end up

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,500
with a lot more contributions because it

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,120
processes better you also have a faster

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,920
time to merge and isn't that great

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,810
because if it's a faster time to merge

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,970
you're able to finish your roadmap more

00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:58,150
quickly and you have a faster time to

00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:02,710
release not only is it faster to release

00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:04,870
but you're releasing better lynus

00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,280
is famously said and we have all heard

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,260
it so many times that even I'm sick of

00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,720
hearing it that with enough eyes all

00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,630
bugs are shallow right drive through

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,180
contributors get you a lot of eyes which

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,950
means you find a lot more bugs then you

00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,390
fix a lot more bugs because they're not

00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,490
only finding them but they're fixing

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,290
them for you they're also adding more

00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,970
test coverage along the line and as

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,640
early as we definitely appreciate that

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,170
more than many communities and you're

00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,960
also getting a lot more documentation

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:34,000
coverage it's lovely you get so much

00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,770
more quality out of your project if

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,480
you're able to foster drive through

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:40,540
contributions because they're bringing

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:44,590
you that stuff overall it also means you

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:47,220
have a healthier project culture excuse

00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:50,320
me pretending I'm not about to sneeze um

00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,900
your project overall is seen as more

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,890
welcoming and more helpful and more

00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:59,380
friendly and this is lovely between all

00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:02,080
the other stuff I just listed and these

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,640
and the low no bling right all of these

00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,910
you end up with a better project

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:09,540
reputation you know what that just got

00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:11,220
you a really beneficial cycle

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,990
because people hear about your amazing

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,300
project and how great it is and how

00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,459
wonderful it is to use and how well

00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,100
tested and documented and how good you

00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,180
are for contributions and then they send

00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,649
their friends and they send their

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,300
friends and more people use it and you

00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:27,540
find more bugs and it's really a

00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,639
wonderful wonderful sort of cycle but it

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,139
all starts by looking at that one part

00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:36,060
of the community the drivers and trying

00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:38,540
to make it easier for them you've got

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:43,139
that okay so healthy a project overall

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:45,720
um and it's just from trying to maximize

00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:47,519
one segment of your community that's all

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,589
you need to do don't focus on the entire

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,600
thing just what would it take to make it

00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:54,089
easy for one person to show up give me

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,130
one patch and then get out and then

00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:58,199
value that patch so that gives you a

00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:02,220
really healthy project um couple of

00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:04,170
quick words about project health check

00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:08,759
my time so I don't have to rely upon

00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:13,470
Steve totally so how many of you out

00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:15,750
there run projects of some variety okay

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,639
keep your hands up of those people with

00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:22,110
your hands up how many of you measure

00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:24,209
project health in any way Oh fewer than

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:27,899
I thought okay um okay you can put your

00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:29,639
hands down now thank you um so there are

00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:32,940
a lot of different possible metrics you

00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:36,029
can use and I will direct you here cute

00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,769
lost community metrics or this is a

00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,720
meeting that happens at least once a

00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:41,670
year I believe it also happens at fall

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,959
stem so it happened just before ozcan

00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,500
during the community leadership summit

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:50,370
it also happens i think it was them or

00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:52,680
one of the EU open source big open

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,810
source conferences but a las community

00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,699
metrics or talks about this sort of

00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,260
stuff and what sort of metrics you could

00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:02,160
use for your project what makes sense

00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:03,449
for your project so i encourage you to

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,829
go look at that but in the meantime here

00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:06,809
are some examples of things you could

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:08,010
potentially look at and these are not

00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,870
going to be the same for every project

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,510
that depends on your needs and what's

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:14,400
important to your project the number of

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,939
downloads stars and forks this one's

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,920
obvious and it is so easy to get the

00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:22,380
number of contributors also very

00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:25,670
yet we all have access to our source

00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:28,800
control logs so we can just count them

00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,900
the number of contributions again can

00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,610
just count them very easy but if these

00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,420
things are select are going up slightly

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:38,550
then you might be doing something right

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,800
the number of issues opened and closed

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:44,070
and buy clothes I've mean legitimately

00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,510
closed not like a you know will not fix

00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,920
or works for me or something like that i

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:53,450
mean like legitimately close and then

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:55,160
the number of patches submitted based on

00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,320
according to the number of patches

00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,180
accepted this ratio if you're doing

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,040
drive-throughs well and you've got an

00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:05,250
overall healthy project and overall

00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,260
healthy process will be really high and

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,640
it will constantly grow and that's

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,050
pretty cool it means that you're doing

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,820
something right because people know up

00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:15,120
front what they should be doing in order

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,640
to contribute and also there is a

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,870
contributor age where age is defined by

00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,940
whatever makes the most sense for your

00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,700
project when's the first time they open

00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,050
bug when's the first time they showed up

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,530
in a mailing list you know whatever

00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:30,030
makes sense for you am I making it hard

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:38,290
for the camera man by the way with my

00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:40,480
wondering okay um hardware

00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,030
so um I've given you all these

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,980
advantages and hopefully you're at least

00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,930
intrigued enough to listen to methods

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:51,310
for maximizing you drive through

00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:53,680
contributions um so how do you do this

00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:56,020
and the very first answer and the

00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,080
majority of my directions here and

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:01,570
suggestions are going to be based upon

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:06,700
documentation documentation gives your

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:08,350
project superpowers full stop a lot of

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,060
us don't like documenting we think it

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,250
takes the time away from the code it

00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,590
doesn't what it does is it makes things

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,270
easier for people going forward I don't

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:19,000
know about you guys but my brain doesn't

00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:21,700
scale so therefore I like to get things

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,230
out into documentation and that's really

00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:28,030
easy to share with people so once you

00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,460
have documentation or as you are doing

00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,690
documentation oh and by the way I'm

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,540
going to give you a whole bunch of

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:37,690
suggestions here I'm not at any moment

00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:40,000
suggesting you do them all oh my god no

00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,980
nobody's got that kind of time I am

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,570
saying perhaps pick one or two that

00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,480
might be lower hanging fruit for your

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:49,630
particular project try them out and then

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,120
measure actually you should benchmark

00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,590
first measure try them out then measured

00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,080
and see whether they move the needle and

00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,790
you know just keep slowly iterating this

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,290
is an iterative process that's where you

00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,740
put the value with that right but

00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,780
programmers so documentation it will it

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,060
ensures that people are really efficient

00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,040
with their contributions upfront you

00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:11,290
give them all their information they

00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,090
don't have to ask people and if they

00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:16,410
don't have to ask people you save time

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:20,170
you say their time which is you know of

00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:21,940
not insignificant value but you also

00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,950
save your time and you say the time of

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,750
all of your core contributors not only

00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:28,240
do you save time but you save

00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,400
frustration because you get the same

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,440
questions over and over and over again

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,570
he document that you're not going

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,300
to get a question um it also helps to

00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,710
standardized processes so everyone is

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,110
doing everything the same way and that

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,360
sets up expectations and that makes it a

00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,340
lot easier to review patches makes it

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,380
easier to bring people on board makes it

00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,570
easier to answer questions it just makes

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:54,390
everything easier if your standard

00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,390
standardizing processes upfront um so

00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:00,720
one of those pieces of documentation you

00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,830
can hand people is a quick start guide

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,410
how many of you have been in a project

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:08,260
chat room I'm just going to assume IRC

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,790
because it's my flavor of choice um so

00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,150
how many of you have been in a project

00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:15,670
IRC channel and had some newbie walk in

00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:18,820
and say hey how do I get started I want

00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:22,990
to contribute probably almost all of you

00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:24,670
right why don't you document that if you

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,070
get that question so frequently please

00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:30,070
doc it so uh it's just a high-level

00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:32,440
summary and it's essentially just a link

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:35,650
to all relevant docs start here if you

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,090
want to contribute read XYZ PDQ and one

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,070
of those things you should link to is a

00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:42,930
very specific how to contribute document

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:46,420
and this is your entire process in

00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:49,600
intricate detail do you use spaces or

00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:52,510
tabs are you using Perl critic for

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,210
anything our tests absolutely mandatory

00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:56,860
and if so how what sort of tests this

00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,680
documentation mandatory I would say yes

00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:02,710
but I'm biased you know make it just a

00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,260
checklist checklists are great

00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:07,510
checklists save lives you should check

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,790
on some of the research someday on

00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,680
hospitals and what has happened to the

00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:14,050
mortality rate the moment they start

00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,780
instituting checklists it goes way down

00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:19,390
so checklists they're easy so just make

00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:23,140
one it's quick it's easy um this can be

00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:25,330
your contribute file and let's say you

00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,860
have a github repo I use github more

00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,360
than get lab or a bit pocket or any of

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,490
those i'll just use that as my examples

00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,820
it could put a contribute or a

00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:35,350
contribute md file in your github repo

00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,450
then when somebody goes to make a pull

00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:40,480
request it puts up a flag at the top a

00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,950
banner saying are you contributing check

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,000
this out and it's a link to your

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:47,170
contributors md5 and then you're going

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,370
to catch a lot of those people who don't

00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,920
bother to read it to begin with and just

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,420
on your patch but they can also verify

00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,790
that they've got all the things that you

00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:57,190
need in order to move forward and that

00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:59,520
contributors our thoughts should include

00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:02,100
things like before we merge your patch

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,320
there will be code review

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,580
and at least two poor contributors have

00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,920
two plus one that before it will be

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,710
merged set up as many expectations as

00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,990
possible so you contribute there is

00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:18,250
never wondering well now what what do I

00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:20,980
do next another fun thing to document

00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:23,380
our communication routes um let's go

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,660
back to that IRC newbie question again

00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,610
somebody walks into your IRC channel how

00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,230
many of you have heard somebody ask or

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,150
read somebody ask unless you're having a

00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:32,890
screen reader around your IRA see how

00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:37,780
many of you have seen somebody asked

00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:40,570
well who do I ask about dot dot dot we

00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:43,720
can document that stuff can document

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:46,270
whom to contact for what and how the how

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,520
is really important they might have come

00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,350
into your IRC channel but you might not

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,570
really monitor it so much you might

00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:56,350
prefer to put things in your mailing

00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:59,530
list or in your issue tracker or maybe

00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:01,000
you use slack instead you know but

00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:04,810
they're not going to know that and you

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,880
can't really hold a contributor at fold

00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,230
if you're not talking them which to use

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,930
if they're using the wrong one and you

00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,580
haven't told them otherwise well sure

00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:14,560
that's your fault not theirs um so you

00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:17,230
can document this another thing that I

00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:19,050
suggest sometimes projects do if they

00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,270
get a lot of drive through contributors

00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:24,970
have a dedicated communication rope for

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:27,250
new contributors so you do have IRC

00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:31,360
channels so you have you know hash moose

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:33,850
right have cash moustache new just for

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,790
new people to show up and then if you've

00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:39,070
got drive-throughs direct them there in

00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:43,300
your contributors guide direct them to

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:46,180
Cashman's dash knew then this does two

00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,280
things for you a gets a lot of noise out

00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,140
of your primary channel and reduces

00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,970
frustration of the people who just don't

00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,650
want to deal with that they just want to

00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,660
get on with their life but it happens

00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,640
right not all of us are necessarily in

00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:01,120
the best mood for new contributors every

00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,010
single day but what it also does is it

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,350
gives your drive through contributors a

00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:07,690
sense of freedom to ask those stupid

00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,400
questions because they're not asking it

00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,840
in front of every core contributor out

00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,910
there so they don't feel so bad they're

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,210
asking in front of other people who have

00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,740
never done that before

00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,480
and that gives you a sense of confidence

00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:24,920
to ask questions you might not do

00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:26,000
otherwise so all right oh by the way if

00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,490
you do have this make sure you

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,910
coordinate with your community that

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,590
somebody is actually there it doesn't

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,810
make much sense to have a dedicated

00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,240
communication route for new contributors

00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:40,520
if if there's nobody there answering

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,320
questions that really frustrates people

00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,840
and it will send your number of drive

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,630
through contributions to the crapper so

00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,190
something else you should have yes a

00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,190
code of conduct I'm going there I'm

00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:57,160
going to say it this is not a nice to

00:25:52,190 --> 00:26:00,290
have this is a must have just because

00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,150
you are not seeing or hearing a bad

00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,650
behavior in your community in in your

00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,220
project does not mean it is not

00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:10,070
happening it merely means you are not

00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:12,410
hearing it or seeing it having a code of

00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:14,360
conduct is not going to hurt your

00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,680
existing community at all unless your

00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,300
existing community is populated by

00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,040
 in which case what are you

00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,750
doing there anyway I'm going to time all

00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:26,330
of my jokes for when Sawyer is taking a

00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:28,400
drink you're welcome i love you um so

00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:30,470
it's not going to hurt your existing

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,750
community but what it will do is tell

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,970
people coming by to make their

00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,130
contribution that you care about their

00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:41,600
safety you have put thought into it and

00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:43,820
you care so uh these don't have to be

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,280
some and I actually recommend they not

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,530
be really really detailed of examples of

00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,660
bullet points of don't do don't do don't

00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,920
do don't do because that just gets the

00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,530
bean counters out there going out well

00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,440
you didn't say I couldn't you know go up

00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:59,840
and cut Andrews hair it wasn't on the

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,450
list so I'm gonna do it you know don't

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,240
do that just but examples of expected

00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:08,300
behavior just examples amongst our

00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:12,710
weaponry are now um also examples of

00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:18,490
unacceptable behavior um no touching of

00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:20,960
anyone else unless they ask no no

00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:22,580
arguing with somebody and calling them

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,560
an idiot when you have problems with

00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:28,260
their technology you know don't make

00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,960
attacks also you should give the

00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:33,240
consequences what would happen if you

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,480
transgress that code of conduct or

00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,730
statement or sock as we have in Pearl

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:43,200
what happens if you transgress that and

00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:46,170
this is a range it's not just you get

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,880
booted from the community know the thing

00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,740
about people breaking these is often

00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,940
it's not malicious sometimes it is

00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,650
sometimes I know they're doing something

00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,110
bad but usually it just comes out of

00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:57,240
ignorance so the very first thing you

00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,070
should start with is coaching here's

00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,660
what you did here's why it is wrong and

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:03,060
here's the appropriate behavior do you

00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:05,220
understand what steps do we have to do

00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,930
how can I help make sure you don't do

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,570
this again what can I do to help you

00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,860
coaching that's it first but it can go

00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,050
all the way up to kicking somebody out

00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,070
in which case your entire community has

00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,930
to figure out what does that look like

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:18,600
and how does that work but don't be

00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:21,540
afraid to do it don't foster

00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,970
and assholery methods for reporting this

00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,400
is incredibly important because if

00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,380
somebody has to ask how do I report a

00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,850
problem with a COC nobody's going to do

00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,550
it if you look in the back of your

00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:34,230
badges every single badge for a gap see

00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:37,230
has an email address where you can

00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:39,690
report problems with the SOC I've never

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:41,370
seen a conference do that before and I

00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,170
do this alone I think I'm doing 16

00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,090
conferences this year this is the only

00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:46,650
one that does that you know how amazing

00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:49,410
that is how great we are as a community

00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,970
for doing that I mean until you've been

00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,560
out there looking at everything you

00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,000
don't see the little things and this is

00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,370
a little thing that's really amazing so

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,470
thank you pearl and one other thing

00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:00,030
which should be publicly written down is

00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,680
these statements for deciding the

00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,990
consequences of the methods for deciding

00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,810
the consequences please don't have the

00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:09,240
actual conversation in public that

00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:11,220
goes behind closed doors but the method

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,320
of deciding should be out there in

00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,660
public not only so people know what to

00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,160
expect but also so if you're not holding

00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,830
up your end of the bargain they can call

00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,690
you on your so doc that alright

00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,870
beaten that one into the ground moving

00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:27,480
on who's who probably a lot of people in

00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,820
your project or they could you just a

00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,040
few but every drive-through contributor

00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,210
would like to know whom to contact

00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,030
should they have specific questions

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,549
about say security a documentation or

00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:39,320
style that

00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:40,820
like that so just stop that who are the

00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,330
project leaders the pole contributors

00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:47,059
the SMEs and if you have any sub teams

00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:51,139
if you're a very large project my team

00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:52,970
works primarily an OpenStack and it is

00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:55,159
probably I believe officially the

00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,019
largest open source project in the world

00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:00,379
right now so there's a lot of something

00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:05,509
so we docked that stuff then their rules

00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:07,129
and processes this is probably obvious

00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:10,039
but a couple that are less obvious is

00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:12,460
how to become core this can be very

00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:14,450
inspiring for people when they we

00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,940
they're coming through just to make one

00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:18,320
little patch and they see a weight if I

00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,029
do those things I can become core

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,539
contributor they've actually thought

00:30:20,029 --> 00:30:26,059
about that well I like a challenge and

00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:27,529
they'll stick around possibly and if

00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:29,629
nothing else it helps your existing

00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:32,239
community because you've just set the

00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:36,350
bar you must be this hard to ride this

00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:38,509
ride right or to become core right this

00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:40,159
is where you need to be so everybody in

00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:43,070
your community is able to look at all of

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,109
their peers and say wow they're doing a

00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:47,389
great job they've exceeded that bar

00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:49,129
there a core contributor now and they

00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:50,899
can bring it up at whatever process you

00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:52,179
have for naming somebody a core

00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:56,600
contributor and hand them over a

00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:59,299
commitment but it keeps unintentional

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,559
bias out of the picture we all know what

00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:02,749
a core contributor looks like because

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,539
we've written it down so there for

00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:08,029
anybody and a race color gender creed

00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:10,609
who does these things can be a core

00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:11,960
contributor and all bias is gone now

00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:14,690
that helps to show people that you

00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,169
really care if you are large enough to

00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:19,970
have elections OpenStack is doc that I

00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:21,139
don't know a lot of pearl projects that

00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,850
are large enough to do this so we're

00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:25,340
just going to skip that haha but if

00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:27,159
there are governance changes a lot of

00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,749
projects I see don't think about

00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:32,059
documenting how to make those governance

00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:34,580
changes and that actually the problem

00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:37,759
because as projects get larger and they

00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:40,159
evolve their governance gets calcified

00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:43,759
and they're unable to make the changes

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,070
to grow appropriately with the with the

00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,149
changes of the project so think about

00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,769
that in advance and

00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:50,479
sort of documented it doesn't have to be

00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:52,099
none of these by the way I have to be

00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:54,679
entirely thorough you're not going to

00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:57,589
get every point at every document so

00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:59,239
feel free to just do an 80% job and keep

00:31:57,589 --> 00:32:00,769
iterating until you get to closer and

00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:02,299
closer to one hundred percent but really

00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:04,549
it's Zeno's documentation right it's

00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:07,009
never really done if you have a project

00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:09,169
roadmap do that it helps drive through

00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:10,909
contributors see whether their thing is

00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:12,289
actually going to be on the release

00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:13,519
schedule whether the patch will be on

00:32:12,289 --> 00:32:19,070
there whether it's something you

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:21,049
actually need or want or expect and then

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,330
document how to get there patch into a

00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:25,639
release if it's not on the roadmap what

00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:27,049
can you do to kind of you know if your

00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:30,649
drive your contributor she keeps coming

00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:31,609
by and going poke poke poke poke then it

00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,080
could be that you didn't document

00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:35,739
probably how to go through the process

00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:38,450
what could be that they're adjourned um

00:32:35,739 --> 00:32:40,639
and then one that a lot of projects

00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:43,219
don't do and it leads to a lot of

00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:45,469
exclusionary and unwelcoming behavior is

00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:50,299
we don't document our job in our

00:32:45,469 --> 00:32:52,749
acronyms and abbreviations so if you

00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:54,739
want people to submit effective

00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:57,559
contributions teach them a little

00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:58,999
language you use otherwise they will be

00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,609
speaking completely different language

00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:04,759
and communication is difficult that way

00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:08,469
so document your jargon document your

00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:12,460
acronyms document your abbreviations and

00:33:08,469 --> 00:33:15,679
what makes people feel most left out

00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:18,589
document your in jokes few things make

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,479
people feel more excluded quite like

00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:22,609
being a room full of people laughing and

00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:25,969
you don't get the joke just because its

00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:28,849
name joke we in technology and as humans

00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:30,799
in general use in jokes as a gating sort

00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:33,289
of thing if you don't get it you're not

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,599
one of us and that's really unwelcoming

00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:36,919
and it can drive people away so you

00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:38,479
might get the pachitea drive for

00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:40,099
contributor but you'll have very little

00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:43,969
hope of keeping them around as a

00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:45,440
community member so all right we've

00:33:43,969 --> 00:33:46,489
gotten the documentation other way like

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,289
I said there's rather a lot of

00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:49,489
documentation I would love to see in

00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:51,859
every single project it's not going to

00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:53,779
happen but here's hoping right onward

00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:55,339
and upward mentoring what could you do

00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:58,540
from entering well first and foremost is

00:33:55,339 --> 00:34:00,790
code review um

00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:02,980
a lot of us use github now I haven't

00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:05,260
used get love a lot get lab a lot but I

00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:08,140
know that it also has ways to do code

00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:10,440
review so do that and it's really great

00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:12,970
not only if you get higher quality code

00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,460
but you form a bond with your drive

00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:16,840
through contributor and once somebody

00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,700
has a bond with you they're more likely

00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,320
to come back and regardless they leave

00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,490
feeling good so long as you're not a

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,380
jerk about it you may be a jerk about

00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:31,350
they would kiss no that's a another

00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:36,310
problem um you can do office hours say

00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:38,500
thursday at a two o'clock UTC our

00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:40,679
security expert will be in our chat room

00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,660
answering all questions for two hours

00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,919
and anybody who's a drive to contributor

00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,900
who is paying attention to your project

00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:48,880
it has a security thing they wish to get

00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,710
fixed they can show up and ask their

00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,900
questions right there and get a deep

00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,330
dive into everything they need and so

00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,490
that can be really really useful you can

00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:00,790
also run them for look just people who

00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:04,810
have never contributed before hackfest

00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:07,320
really lovely this is a really great way

00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:09,790
to provide hands-on mentoring to people

00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,320
who want to contribute to your project

00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,450
and they're very related to new

00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,120
contributor events except this is

00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:18,790
obviously very focused perhaps that's a

00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:20,590
new contributor events it odds are

00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:23,110
remarkably good that the vast majority

00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:24,820
of people who show up there and submit

00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:27,190
their first patch will never submit

00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:30,040
another they will become drive by

00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:31,660
contributors and that's okay because you

00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,950
still have their patch and they leave

00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,410
with a warm happy feeling of having

00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:37,150
contributed to open source so that's

00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:39,010
great it also gives you a great

00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:42,010
opportunity to watch how people

00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:43,420
contribute is it difficult for them do

00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:45,220
they ask a lot of the same questions

00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:47,560
well those things are right to be put

00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:49,570
into your documentation this is a user's

00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,220
study really so use a study out of which

00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:54,520
you get a lot of fantastic patches so

00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:56,800
that's great so these don't have to be

00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,950
anything major I'm not talking about you

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,750
know sponsorship the null that's sort of

00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:04,540
pull the role and rubbish you can just

00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,980
tweet or post on the mailing list or

00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,490
something hey everybody in the South

00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,050
Philly

00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:10,720
area we're going to be gathering at this

00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:12,940
pub at two o'clock on Saturday everyone

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,610
show up new contributors welcomes and

00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:17,290
that last bit is key you don't say new

00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,580
contributors welcome they're not going

00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,140
to show up and they're going to feel out

00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,030
of place but if you call it out

00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:23,380
specifically and say yes new

00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,510
contributors welcome people will be

00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,890
there to help with new contributors it's

00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,080
much more likely you'll get people

00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,940
combine and driving through so that's

00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,950
great then there's some process

00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,090
improvements you can do you do have

00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:38,230
those people who love you they really

00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:39,400
love you and they want to contribute but

00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:42,850
I don't have a lot of time so make it

00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,020
easy for them tag starter bones so they

00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:45,520
can show up they can make the

00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,180
contribution they can feel really good

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,380
about helping something they love

00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,030
something most projects don't do it I

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,500
think is I would love to see an

00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:57,010
experiment of people doing this is a

00:36:53,500 --> 00:37:00,970
contributor SLA they have taken a lot of

00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:03,610
time to give you a patch and you have in

00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:06,460
your contributor agreement oh hey we're

00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:07,810
going to do our damnedest to review this

00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:11,290
patch and get back to you within five

00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:13,690
days you can say it and you could you

00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,890
know you don't promise you do stress

00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,380
we're going to do our darkness because

00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:19,720
OMG we've got lives but if you say this

00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,150
then people that it sets up a lovely

00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:25,450
expectation and hopefully they'll learn

00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:28,330
that they don't have to poke you until

00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:29,650
after five days is done right so this

00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:32,410
this is something that not a lot of

00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:34,690
projects do it is hard especially if you

00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:37,270
get a lot of patches but it would be I

00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:41,109
would love to see research on projects

00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:43,359
that have done this um and then there

00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:47,350
you can create a container or a vm an

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:50,109
actual virtual machine mattamy a image

00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:52,630
of your dev environment so people who

00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:55,390
just want to drive by give you one

00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:59,380
little fix don't have to spend a day and

00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:02,020
a half downloading all of Sipan just to

00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,180
make their dev environment work we can

00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:06,910
we have the technology we can do this I

00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,990
think about it is it does require a fair

00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,760
bit of maintenance

00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:12,130
you have to have somebody there to make

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,100
sure that this stays up to date and that

00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,480
can be a bit of a drag but um it's one

00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,369
of those things you can run a bit of a

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,630
cost-benefit analysis in your head does

00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:21,610
it are we getting more contributors

00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,840
because we're making it easier for them

00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:25,420
to do that are we getting more really

00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,940
great patches if so then this is a good

00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:30,220
return on investment the time to

00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,950
maintain your container image of your

00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:35,350
dev environment and finally we have some

00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:39,760
culture changes we can do first of all

00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:42,970
value contributions thank people value

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:47,260
them value contributors put them in your

00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:49,390
contributors bob foster a a culture of

00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,550
documentation and this doesn't

00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:53,290
necessarily have to be docking it right

00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:55,270
then but it does have to be valuing

00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,950
documentation when something comes up in

00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:00,310
the IRC channel on they mailing list

00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:01,450
where a decision is made or an edict is

00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,250
brought down or something like that you

00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,570
don't have to dock it on the spot but it

00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,880
would be really helpful and only

00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:09,420
probably take about like our 60 seconds

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,609
to create an issue for that a dock bug

00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:15,430
darkness and guess what new contributors

00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:18,400
and drive their contributors love doc

00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:22,270
bugs they'll fix that for you if

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,859
you write up a bug for it so value that

00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,540
but if you don't value documentation

00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:29,680
that'll never happen and also you can

00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:31,600
default to assess assistance helping

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,270
others should not be seen as a burden

00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:36,400
and a distraction it should be seen as

00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:38,380
they raison d'etre for almost every

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,350
member of the community to be welcoming

00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,210
to be friendly to be helpful this entire

00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,440
culture change we are very squishy

00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,840
difficult people as I mentioned earlier

00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,420
it's you can't do this without leading

00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,100
from the top and it's very difficult to

00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,109
do in general but you must get buy-in

00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,660
from all the core contributors they must

00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:58,359
know not only what you're trying to do

00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:00,310
but why and they must believe in it and

00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:03,400
they must lead from the top and lead by

00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:07,619
example so that's how you affect any

00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:11,500
culture change really most importantly

00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:13,900
Institute in no rule period and

00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,380
full stop we all know a lot of projects

00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:18,029
that have like that person in it

00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:22,230
and that person says things that are

00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:24,269
offensive and rude and these people

00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:25,890
don't exist in projects because while

00:40:24,269 --> 00:40:27,450
you know people will be people these

00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:30,240
people exist in projects because we

00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,980
tolerate them more specifically it's not

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,069
that we tolerate them we tolerate the

00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:38,009
behavior that's the problem not the

00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:40,140
person so um institute or no

00:40:38,009 --> 00:40:42,720
rule caution is needed however when

00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:45,269
dealing with this again assholery does

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,480
not typically come from malicious intent

00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:51,180
it does come from ignorance so please be

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,789
empathetic to people who do bad things

00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,980
and again start from coaching start from

00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:57,900
a place of empathy assume they don't

00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:02,279
understand that what they did is wrong

00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:04,559
and why they did it is wrong the

00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:06,000
empathetic but firm do not tolerate

00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:10,819
assholery but do you do something about

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:14,910
it and finally you can do outreach

00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:16,920
express gratitude recognize your

00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:18,720
contributors in some way it doesn't have

00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,299
to be large just seeing your name in

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,309
print and the author's file is really

00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:26,940
all it needs some times and then follow

00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:29,609
up right how was your experience we've

00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,900
got these these logs we can see if

00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:33,089
somebody showed up and didn't come back

00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:35,160
I haven't programmed full-time since

00:41:33,089 --> 00:41:37,950
2009 and I can run this report

00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,299
so you know do that ask people get their

00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,589
collective email addresses and then

00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:42,900
reach out to them what was your

00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:45,299
experience was like how can I improve

00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:47,400
the experience and then why did you

00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:48,630
leave because if you don't ask you never

00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,789
going to know you're going to be left

00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:52,049
assuming so just ask it's not really

00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:53,400
that big of a deal a lot of people won't

00:41:52,049 --> 00:41:56,819
answer you but the ones that do you will

00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,470
give you immense feedback so um that's

00:41:56,819 --> 00:42:01,230
all the official content i have but i am

00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:03,960
going to dog food and provide some

00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:05,579
gratitude I did do that research and a

00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,740
number of people had very protracted

00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:10,529
conversations with me about it some of

00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,930
them agreed to be publicly thank for

00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:17,220
that here are those people some of the

00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:19,289
names you do recognize so thank these

00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,400
people they and others took an immense

00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:22,140
amount of time with me and I'm very

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,049
grateful then i had a couple of people

00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,670
who looked at this talk throughout its

00:42:24,049 --> 00:42:27,690
evolution this is the third time I've

00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,500
given it now and I'm going to give it

00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:31,260
probably about two

00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:33,450
three more times at least uh our own

00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:35,340
Jean hat thank you dear he looked at the

00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,590
stuff at the very beginning and a very

00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,150
very nascent state and I'm sorry for

00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:41,990
subjecting him to that then my first

00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:44,970
friend Chris noida Bauer had a good look

00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:49,800
but primary thanks go to my friend Steve

00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:51,330
Wally he is an open source luminary he's

00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,830
a marvelous human being to have a

00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:54,480
conversation with and we do have

00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,400
conversations all the time and it was

00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,620
during one of those conversations that I

00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,820
latched onto a lot of the concepts that

00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:05,670
I am now telling you about so everybody

00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,870
asks I'll just tell you yes this slides

00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,390
will be available and they're available

00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:11,250
right now thank you internet archive

00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:13,470
they are right here you can go there

00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:16,440
right now what I would like you to do is

00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:18,810
to go there at some point very very soon

00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,140
because there is an evaluation link on

00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:23,880
that page like I said I have given this

00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,860
talk several times already and I will be

00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,380
getting it several times more I value

00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:31,320
your feedback every time I give this

00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:33,390
talk or any of my talks i integrate the

00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,460
feedback I received from other people to

00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:38,190
help improve it for the next audience so

00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,810
you are valuable wonderful people and I

00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:43,250
would love to get your feedback on that

00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:46,590
right there so good let me hit the slide

00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:48,750
provide some feedback that is all the

00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:50,570
official content i have believe we have

00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:55,170
a few minutes how many minutes we have

00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:58,740
seven minutes well i'm seeing we have

00:43:55,170 --> 00:44:00,470
six minutes but who's counting anyway so

00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:03,210
we do have time for questions or

00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:04,530
possibly comment masquerading as

00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:06,750
questions although i would rather you

00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:11,580
didn't do that so any questions from the

00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:12,960
audience yes what's your name here hi

00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,310
Henry I'm just going to ask that of

00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,410
everyone whether I know you were not for

00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:18,410
the most part so hi Henry

00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,310
that are just not acceptable now

00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:25,869
alienating the contributor they want to

00:44:24,310 --> 00:44:27,340
submit something but it's not acceptable

00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:32,100
forever reasons not the right direction

00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:36,340
was hot but you don't want to alienate

00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:37,450
then you want them to come back okay so

00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,810
the question is how do you handle

00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:44,260
patches that are not acceptable with

00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:46,300
empathy first of all and if you have to

00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,250
tell somebody that you cannot accept

00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:52,330
their patch please for the love a dog

00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:54,330
tell them why and never make it personal

00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:57,100
and if at all possible provide feedback

00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:57,970
your code is unacceptable in quality

00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,650
although you don't say that because

00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:02,980
unacceptable is a stop word that makes

00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:06,220
people go oh well you can't accept your

00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:09,820
patch because it doesn't need our coding

00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:11,410
guidelines here they are have a look and

00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,910
then submit it back and we'll help you

00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:16,270
through it or if you would like help

00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:19,359
offer help again default to assistance

00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:21,070
and try to bring them back into the fold

00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:23,920
it you don't necessarily have to just

00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:27,280
say no and leave it at that it can be

00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:30,580
not now because and then help them get

00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,070
through sense to emerge a whole request

00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,600
and then change eight percent of it so

00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,670
that they feel like they got their

00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,230
contribution in

00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:42,050
so the question is yeah the question is

00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:44,720
does it make sense to take their pull

00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:48,070
request accept that and then change a

00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,359
lot of it um that's kind of a dick move

00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:53,540
to be honest it makes people feel like

00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:56,270
they they have been short given short

00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:58,880
shrift so work through it with them and

00:45:56,270 --> 00:46:01,400
do the code review and and like do pair

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,800
programming and help them through it and

00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,180
what you'll get is probably not only a

00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,130
driver's but somebody who will stick

00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:09,109
around and you've just helped them

00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:11,690
become a better programmer and that's

00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:13,490
great right a lot of people in our

00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:16,400
industry really want to contribute to

00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:17,869
projects but they're so new they've gone

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,150
through like a hacker camp and think

00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:22,099
they're hot they don't know a lot

00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:24,260
of the stuff that we do and they're not

00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:26,240
going to learn if we don't share so try

00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:32,060
and share at all possible another

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:35,080
question ok yes sir what's your name Lee

00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,080
hello Lee

00:46:55,210 --> 00:47:01,270
so the question is what how do I feel

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:04,270
about autoresponders um the answer will

00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:05,859
be it depends on how they're used auto

00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:08,740
responders is better than something

00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:10,630
going to dev null you get some sort of

00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,670
feedback back there but really for these

00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:13,869
projects were they it's your patches

00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:16,000
have been sitting around for about four

00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:17,349
years you say what an autoresponder

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,670
really have mattered if he got a

00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:21,670
response for years ago and they never

00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:23,589
got back to it right so autoresponders

00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:24,869
can be really valuable but only if they

00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:27,490
set up the appropriate expectations

00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:28,869
we're rather overloaded right now trying

00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:32,320
to get something out the door in time

00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:34,260
for this release we will be delayed in

00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,180
responding to and looking at your patch

00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:39,280
that's a good autoresponder that sets up

00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:41,349
good expectations you know so that can

00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,300
be really valuable but there are any

00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:45,460
others it's all the devil's always in

00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:48,670
the detail autoresponders themselves are

00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:52,420
not bad how you use them can be it's

00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:54,790
it's with all tool right um more

00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,080
questions yes Jean hat I'm sorry I'm
