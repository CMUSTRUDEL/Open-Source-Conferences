hello good morning everyone how's

00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:38,250
everyone doing you guys have donuts what

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:42,509
kind of don't say it back there all

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:44,220
kinds awesome alright let's get our

00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:47,039
donuts ready in our coffee coffee and

00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:53,970
donuts ready and enjoy a little

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:56,039
presentation how's that sound awesome hi

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,199
everyone my name is Jordan eller I'm a

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,470
developer advocate at Google I work with

00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,819
developers just like yourselves mostly

00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,789
focusing in the social publishing

00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:07,139
industry and i work with major partners

00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:08,520
who use Google's developer offerings to

00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:12,270
make sure I understand how they can be

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,680
used in ways that drive business success

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,800
so I have a really solid understanding

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,080
of new technologies on the cutting edge

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,639
of technology and how you can use it to

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:27,599
drive success in you know media close to

00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:31,110
my cart and so you may have seen this on

00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:33,360
your lap see website on your schedule

00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:34,740
and I have to admit I may have been

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,240
bending the truth a little bit because

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,740
I'm not here to tell you about some sort

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,569
of secret way to write mobile apps and

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,940
pearl so if you're there for that I

00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:45,419
think you might have to find your way to

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:47,849
the exit but you can actually write

00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:51,150
mobile web apps that are just as

00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:54,180
intuitive and useful and engaging and

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:57,569
powerful as native mobile apps for an

00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:01,889
increasingly mobile audience it's inning

00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:04,110
it's a known industry trend that's users

00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:07,370
are increasingly turning to mobile

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:09,960
devices to reach content digitally and

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:15,150
getting onto mobile devices is key for

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:16,680
any company any website this is actually

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,750
the presentation I submitted or the

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,580
submission that I made you can notice

00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:25,409
that in the bio I think there may have

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:29,069
been some unintentional censorship looks

00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:33,509
like the parrot DM pearl 6a I etat

00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:35,460
autonomy of prevented once again my

00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:38,430
attempt to

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,680
save you all I'm going to be going in

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,229
very shallow depth across a broad number

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,520
of topics if you want to get more

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,610
information this is the website you go

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,789
to i'll be posting this along with the

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,710
slides online later but if you'd like

00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:54,660
please feel free to reach out this is

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,979
the best website to go to you get a lot

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,009
of great content from the google

00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:01,319
developers team including def bites bite

00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:03,380
sized web video youtube videos they can

00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,150
help you understand emerging web

00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:10,560
technologies as well as code labs

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:13,020
tutorials and documentation i'll be

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,020
covering polymer service worker those

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,599
are two new emerging technologies as

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,849
well as the concept of mobile pneus and

00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:26,639
if we have time we may get to some other

00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:28,590
topics as well maybe so what is the

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,289
mobile web challenge so again

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:35,190
increasingly we're finding that users

00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:36,810
are going to mobile devices first very

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,440
recently we announced that within the US

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:41,820
the majority of google searches occur on

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,459
mobile devices as opposed to traditional

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,490
desktop or laptop devices and this is a

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:49,890
trend that we've seen across the

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:52,610
ecosystem increasingly particularly in

00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:55,290
some locales and countries than others

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:58,110
but for the first time I believe u.s.

00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,720
and Japan have exceeded mobile / desktop

00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,860
and that's really interesting because

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,300
that's going to affect all of the

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,190
company you work for all of the websites

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,899
that you guys work on any incredible

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,730
content you guys have it's going to be

00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,470
difficult to access on mobile devices

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,000
then it's going to be difficult to

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,690
access for your users customers

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,190
consumers but increasingly as users turn

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,170
to mobile devices they're expect they

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,329
find that these websites are expected to

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,430
behave like mobile apps they're going to

00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:26,820
look they want them users want these

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:30,209
websites to look and feel like a native

00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,610
application they want to be scalable

00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:34,680
resizable they want to be interactive

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,380
they want to have access to hardware

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,649
devices and thing and features that are

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:44,010
not easily done through current web

00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:47,100
technologies and these are those current

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,930
web technologies with tools like these

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:54,330
it's very difficult to

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:59,339
to develop an application that is as

00:09:54,330 --> 00:10:02,520
engaging as a native application and we

00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:06,089
have a solution for that polymer what is

00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:09,330
polymer well I could go into the shadow

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:11,820
DOM and the polyfills and the shims and

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,940
all the magic that makes them happen but

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,730
the gist of it is that it is a little

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,130
bit of glue on top of existing and

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:24,330
developing web standards that allow you

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:28,740
to use features that exist in existing

00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:30,990
back-end technology it's magic it's

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,290
based on these web components the web

00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:36,209
components are a set of open web

00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,420
specifications either in development or

00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:42,990
currently in draft the web working group

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:45,560
and there are a number of these web

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,390
components so in general you have

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,850
templates HTML templates you have

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:53,400
importing you have the shadow DOM and

00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,709
other technologies as well and based on

00:10:53,400 --> 00:11:02,570
these web components polymer can turn

00:10:55,709 --> 00:11:06,150
this into this you can turn div soup and

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:08,370
repetitive chunks of code that

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:11,910
effectively do the same thing over and

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:15,959
over again into simple don't repeat

00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:19,110
yourself get out of your way HTML

00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:24,839
content and you can ask yourself how is

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:26,160
that possible a number of interesting

00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,380
information that you can find on our

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,410
website and then I would suggest but the

00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:34,230
gist of it is that using the web

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,820
component libraries and the magical glue

00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,520
of polymer you can build on top of it

00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,660
and interesting part of polymer and one

00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,820
of the most important bits is that it

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,820
comes with a number of predefined

00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:52,230
template tags components that you can

00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:57,450
use tags that did that's encapsulate

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:59,970
concepts and not format right so that

00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,560
you are able to worry on worry about

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,259
formatting and developing at the HTML

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,069
tags

00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:07,119
less so than you are about the div soup

00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:10,509
additionally polymer comes with a number

00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:12,729
of elements you have elements

00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:15,939
specifically for e-commerce elements

00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:18,519
that include icons for Google and other

00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:21,759
Google services as well as concepts like

00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,729
play and pause elements that play into

00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:27,069
the material design aspects of that

00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:30,429
Google has developed that you can apply

00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:32,019
to your website and again this is all

00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:34,600
made possible with web components and

00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:39,429
with these web components you can take

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:42,369
and implement your own template tags

00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:44,739
that you can share and the idea is that

00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:47,470
you can have a library of templates that

00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:49,179
you can pull in from other people as

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,350
well as your own and with that you can

00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:55,479
share modular eyes and share your

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:58,059
templates your template tags and if it

00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:59,379
the goal is eventually that most of the

00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:01,149
things that you're able to do on a

00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:03,069
website you will be able to use an

00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:06,069
element to implement it and minimize

00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:07,289
repetition in code I'd also like to

00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:11,769
bring your attention serviceworker

00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:16,859
service worker is a platform upon which

00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:18,699
many new mobile technologies are built

00:13:16,859 --> 00:13:21,089
serviceworker essentially think of

00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:23,889
service worker as an event-driven thread

00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:26,649
that lives on the client side of the

00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:31,299
browser that you can interact with using

00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:32,829
javascript on your web page you can do

00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:35,730
incredible things with serviceworker you

00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:38,619
can you you can effectively do caching

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:41,049
offline notifications all sorts of

00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:43,089
incredible things and the goal is that

00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:45,699
with these technologies you can achieve

00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:48,789
the level of feature parity that one

00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:50,709
might have on a native application for

00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:54,970
example you can create complete offline

00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:57,819
experiences by pushing the logic into a

00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:02,199
client-side area you can actually turn

00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:04,869
off data and use functionality the

00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:08,289
previously would have required excuse me

00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:09,339
that would have required 30 and if

00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:11,589
you've ever written the New York City

00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:13,029
Subway you'll know how frustrating it is

00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:15,100
to try and visit websites when you don't

00:14:13,029 --> 00:14:18,230
have data

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,930
it's built upon service worker and also

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,540
with a concept called web app manifest

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:27,410
this is basically a way for the Chrome

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:29,690
browser to understand your website and

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:35,210
how how it can be used to interface with

00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:38,630
a mobile typically you include icons and

00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:41,360
and certain elements that allow you to

00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:43,250
expand functionality so with where that

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,990
manifest and service worker combines you

00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:50,750
can create incredible offline

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:52,400
experiences one of these a of features

00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,440
and one of these is the web app install

00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,620
better the app install banner uses a

00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:03,920
serviceworker to implement itself

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:06,590
essentially when you hit a website over

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,320
a certain amount of time under certain

00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,700
circumstances you can prompt the user to

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,830
add it to their home screen of their

00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,590
mobile device and that allows for easy

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,960
access to your website getting you into

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,340
closer to the hands of the the

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,020
fingertips of the users that you're

00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,630
trying to get an increasing engagement

00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,250
as a result you're also able to

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,850
integrate the theme of the operating

00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:32,870
system simply by adding a meta tag with

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:34,280
the name theme color and I attribute but

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,830
one of the most important parts is push

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,170
notifications push notifications is one

00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:42,080
things that mobile devices have had for

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:46,760
a very long time and push notifications

00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:48,680
allows for reengagement of users in ways

00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,500
that the web sites previously have not

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:55,510
been able to it's a way to surface

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:58,010
notifications using serviceworker code

00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:02,150
essentially what you do is you register

00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:04,130
a event handler that listens that lives

00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:06,800
on the client side ie the operating

00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,960
system and registers with a push

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,120
notification provider we have the Google

00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,250
Cloud messaging provider that you can

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,660
connect to and it will connect with the

00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:18,350
operating system of the mobile device

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:20,030
and in turn you can send push

00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,070
notifications from your back-end server

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:26,150
to Google Cloud messaging server and

00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:28,370
have that hit any of their users that

00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:30,830
match any of the user IDs and and event

00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,090
IDs that you're looking for it's a great

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,530
way to increase your engagement it's

00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:37,820
great way to provide functionality such

00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:40,940
as chat and notifications in ways that

00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:44,570
previously were not as easily accessible

00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:46,130
through web technologies you're also

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,830
able to access the camera and other

00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:53,000
hardware devices this is something that

00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:56,630
is built on top of new technologies in

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,890
in new versions of Chrome with access to

00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,380
hardware devices you can create more

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,210
rich and engaging applications whereas

00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,800
previously users may have had to open a

00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,150
separate application take a picture of

00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,790
their selves and upload it to your

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:11,750
website you can now do that all within

00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:13,970
your web browser you can even access the

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,100
microphone and you'll see in long here

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,589
with each of these examples we have a

00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,080
URL to go to look at the sample

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:25,280
application I feel free to try it out in

00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:27,290
your mobile devices so essentially

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:33,680
what's going on here is that you grab

00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:36,370
the device and it's as simple as a

00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:45,460
couple lines of JavaScript so it's easy

00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:48,350
you can also pull in battery status and

00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,050
importantly you can now programmatically

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,990
identify permission status whereas

00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:58,610
previously if your user denied access to

00:17:53,990 --> 00:18:01,850
certain G like geolocation certain

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:04,040
certain hardware access you wouldn't be

00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,150
able to as easily adapt to it you would

00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,160
have shown an error or something like

00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,650
that and now you can programmatically

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,960
determine and request permissions again

00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:15,590
if the user has declined this allows you

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,920
to do interative permission granting and

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,480
requesting so users don't have to for

00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,760
example immediately as they see your

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,590
website you don't have to request their

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,660
location if you need to provide location

00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:29,810
data for example for them to find the

00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:32,900
low closest store you can do that by

00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:36,260
having them granted on a case-by-case

00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:39,410
basis and if they decline it you can

00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,750
surface a request to reenable it

00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:44,690
programmatically you also able to get

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:48,310
the network information through new

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:52,100
listeners and this allows you to perform

00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:53,420
any any sort of programmatic activity

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,620
you might be able to perform through

00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,620
network device determination

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,210
increasingly users are using mobile

00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,440
devices and part of the difficulty there

00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:08,420
is having to type right so the keyboard

00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,140
for a mobile device on a native

00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:14,360
application frequently is specialized to

00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,070
the content to the input a lot

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,170
previously on web you only have a

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,580
limited number of input types and thus

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,260
you were shown the whole keyboard or a

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,360
number pad which is a little bit

00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:25,460
annoying but now you can get more in

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,610
depth you can pull up date pickers you

00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,320
can pull up email specific or month

00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:34,030
information and you can even pull up

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,030
information like credit cards as well

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,190
indeed if you specify autocomplete you

00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,800
can autocomplete functionality of the

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:46,310
web browser which in chrome is shared

00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,650
across the session so users can have

00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:51,530
content in Google Wallet be

00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:53,210
automatically collected and minimize the

00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:57,430
amount of effort required for a user to

00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:57,430
purchase something from your website

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:03,650
increasingly the Internet of Things has

00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:07,700
drawn us to want to interact with

00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:11,180
devices around us beacons and other

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:14,170
devices as well as vending machines and

00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:20,510
and hotel check-ins and things like that

00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:22,100
and the yeah service and technologies to

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,540
lay on top of that allow you to access

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,670
the hardware components of the device

00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:29,780
that allow you to interact with these

00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:31,280
devices NFC chips and so forth and the

00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,160
key of this is that the web is moving

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,580
closer to native with these increasing

00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,390
technologies you are able to get more

00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,980
and more like a native application and

00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,690
no longer you expected to behave like a

00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,389
mobile application you cannot behave

00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:58,549
like a mobile application

00:20:47,389 --> 00:21:04,059
thank you any questions yes yes the

00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:04,059
signs will be a bell upon line yes yes

00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:09,799
yes it does work outside a crumb so the

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,229
underlying technology it varies

00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:14,869
depending on the browser so for polymers

00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:18,859
specifically many browsers support is

00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:20,869
much wider many browsers will have

00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:22,519
polyfills that you can use basically

00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:25,759
shim functionality if they don't support

00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:27,589
it natively the polyfills they're not

00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,089
performance they're not they're not

00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:30,499
going to be as fast as native

00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:32,179
functionality but at least they have

00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:33,739
full functionality that allows you to

00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:36,549
use those with service workers

00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:41,539
specifically it the support is

00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:43,459
increasing many browsers are supported

00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:46,609
but most of them have stated that they

00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:48,200
will it's a matter of time and these are

00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:50,089
built on open web standards and there's

00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,440
no reason to believe that other browsers

00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:57,139
wouldn't do it if you go to if you can

00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,149
you can google is is serviceworker ready

00:21:57,139 --> 00:22:01,070
or is polymer ready and you should be

00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:06,820
able to find a website that has kind of

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:06,820
the current status for each browser yes

00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:28,520
yeah so I guess your question is is

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,919
there a way to surface your website in

00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:41,990
app source and to my knowledge at this

00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:45,890
time there's not yes yes the best way to

00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:48,130
test is with a android OS that you you

00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:50,650
really need a device with the

00:22:48,130 --> 00:23:02,000
functionality that you're trying to test

00:22:50,650 --> 00:23:04,780
is there a specific yeah sure so Android

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,360
provides for UI UI Automator which is a

00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:10,700
a tool that you can use that basically

00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,270
pokes on the screen for you there are

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,270
others as well

00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:17,599
questions yes

00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:24,500
so it depends on the browser

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,799
implementation and again that's that's

00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,929
variable and you can google and is

00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:38,169
Palmer ready it's serviceworker ready to

00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:38,169
get more information on that yes

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:47,400
now there's no I mean it's all open web

00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,250
standards the AP eyes are open the

00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:57,600
standards are open there's no charge to

00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:59,280
use them to my understanding yes one

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,470
caveat there is service worker push

00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,320
notifications if you use google cloud

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,790
messaging there are fees for using that

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,010
service I don't know exactly what they

00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:09,450
are and you can reach out to them and

00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,340
there are other push notification

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,840
providers as well that may or may not be

00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:20,370
able to be built on top of servers for

00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:21,720
her great thank you so much if you have

00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:23,310
any further questions please check out

00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,790
these two sources developers.google.com

00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:28,920
/ web which is a great way to get all of

00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,450
our new web content as well as

00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,220
youtube.com slash google developers

00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:36,510
where our google developer advocates

00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:38,790
have made a way too many short devbyte

00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:40,560
videos that you can use to get

00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,850
information on emerging web technologies

00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,080
and other emerging technologies as well

00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:45,080
thank you so much
