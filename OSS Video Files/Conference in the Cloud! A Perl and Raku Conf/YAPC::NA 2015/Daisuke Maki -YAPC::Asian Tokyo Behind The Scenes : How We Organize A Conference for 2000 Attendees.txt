okay um i'm just gonna start cuz uh i

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,760
crammed in a lot of stuff in this cuz

00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,680
these slides and even then I couldn't

00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:00,650
put everything I wanted to put in there

00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:05,600
so um hello my name is Daisuke I will be

00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:08,570
talking about yep see Asia and how we we

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:15,350
have so far been preparing to hold the

00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:18,830
gap CAG food for this year so we've been

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,810
holding the FCA Tokyo since 2006 the

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:26,930
first person who did this was a llegar

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:30,440
as you may know but you know like most

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:34,160
uh good hackers they get bored really

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,740
quickly and the by the next year he

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,810
wasn't really into it and by the second

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,550
year somebody took over but it was

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:45,250
really clear that it wasn't going to

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:49,940
last long so I took over at 209 and

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:54,200
since then I've well but just hours I've

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:56,930
been a staff since 2006 and I've been

00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,800
organ have organized six of the last

00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:04,640
seven Yap see ages and last seven of

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:09,290
them six of them so uh yeah thank you

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:14,810
but seriously um I must be mad right yep

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:18,950
I know I know okay I'm getting out I'm

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:21,410
actually gay now because um it this is

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,270
just taking too much of my time in fact

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,840
this is taking about twenty-five percent

00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:30,440
of my time in the year um and it's just

00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:32,270
not working anymore and the money you

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,120
get out of it is not quite enough to

00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,530
sustain you anything like that so um we

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,300
have declared that this is going to be

00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,340
the last yap see Asia Tokyo that we

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,200
going to be holding anyway um you know

00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:46,550
somebody else might pick it up but we

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:48,470
are actually considering liquidating the

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:51,620
organization behind it too because you

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:54,800
know we can't just hold on to all the

00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:58,300
the the money and that we have

00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,130
accumulated and stuff so anyway

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:04,240
that's the AB CH a-- actually how many

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:08,950
of you are organizers here ok a handful

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:12,420
okay all right all right so yep see 2015

00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:15,280
that's the URL you can go look at it uh

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,170
this is going to be the biggest you have

00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,460
seen the world in fact we have been but

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,100
yet because he I've seen the world for

00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:26,460
the last few years but uh this year

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:33,750
we're aiming for 2,000 attendees hmm yep

00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:35,890
yeah it's insane it's the same um and oh

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:43,870
we think how many people do you think

00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:47,290
are behind us staff staff wise good

00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:49,420
guess 12 12 core members a bike or I

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:52,030
mean people who do the planning who do

00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:54,010
the preparation beforehand and that's

00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:56,530
including myself and I am the only one

00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,210
who's being partially paid to do this

00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,160
that that's the only reason why I can

00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:03,640
spend twenty-five percent of my time

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:07,590
doing this stuff and I gotta thank thank

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:13,510
thee the sponsor who also sent me here

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:15,430
maybe thank you thank you all right so

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,830
how do we do it it's it's actually

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:20,860
surprisingly similar to how you would

00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,750
approach an engineering project um you

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:27,000
gotta design it and then you implemented

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:29,920
right um the design part is actually um

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,280
what I've been to sort of riding up and

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:38,200
in my blogs ill blog that I write and

00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:41,200
about missing that at the part that I

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,800
feel missing in the other Yap sees but

00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,950
you know I'll get into that and before I

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,900
go on I'm gonna talk about a bunch of

00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:52,570
different stuff but the AB CH is

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:56,470
completely different from Yap cna we

00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:58,810
shared the same name but really we don't

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,960
do the same thing so you can't directly

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:05,080
compare your app cna to the app see ages

00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:07,330
so keep that in mind and i'm gonna be

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,710
talking a lot about money because that's

00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:13,420
very important

00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:16,210
and currently the yen is so weak I it

00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:19,390
kills me but all the calculations of

00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:24,210
them was hundred yen to a dollar so if

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:27,820
you're picky keep that in mind okay oops

00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:29,260
and I don't think I'm gonna be able to

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,590
say everything I want to say about this

00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,700
so please find you later and if you find

00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:35,920
something interesting please share and

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,170
on your blogs or whatever so other

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,700
people that may want to do a conference

00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:47,710
can pick it up okay so design the

00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:50,800
conference so why do we need to design

00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:54,160
it um I've actually written a fairly

00:14:50,800 --> 00:15:00,280
long blog about this and you can go look

00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:02,200
it up but uh you know you have to know

00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,780
where you going to in order to make

00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,880
decisions and you can't just say oh

00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,460
we're just holding it let's go grab a

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,200
venue you know random venue and wrong

00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,520
with it you have to you have to make a

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:17,560
lot of you know the organizers in here

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,810
know that the you know you have many

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,120
choices and you have to think about do

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:26,170
you wanna do you want to have more room

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:28,660
or do you want to have more more more

00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:30,460
better quality venue whatever you know

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,470
you have there are a lot of things you

00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,630
have to decide so it's very important

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,930
that you design first otherwise you know

00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:41,590
you might be able to go through with it

00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:43,630
but you still might end up with you know

00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:46,720
a Google move of spaghetti code in your

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:49,660
conference so first of all what is the

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,800
conference about um the FC Asia wewe

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:57,030
title is a festival uh not quite a

00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,290
conference a festival for all geeks

00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:02,020
regardless of the community community

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:04,600
that you belong to so it's not just for

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:09,810
pearl geeks actually that's the angle

00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:12,779
we're taking okay

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:15,930
I repeat myself so I'm just gonna next

00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:17,550
one and how big do you want it this this

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:21,330
directly affects where are you going to

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:26,070
hold it so you have to kind of have a

00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:29,510
picture in your head first um we want a

00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:32,520
big festival we you know we want it like

00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:34,200
you know a rock festival a metal

00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,800
festival you know we want people to go

00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,150
remove right um so we didn't want just

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,320
you know handful of people just

00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:46,260
gathering and then just a opening up the

00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:49,050
laptop and talk about code alone we

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,910
wanted people to have fun so um in order

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,260
do that part of it was you know having a

00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:56,610
lot of people so we wanted to increase

00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:58,589
the size as we go along so and while

00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,110
doing that we wanted to really avoid

00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:06,180
being enterprise-e and I think we've

00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:08,730
been successful so far and venues of

00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:12,510
this size are kind of scarce so we

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:16,350
always have the had the option of you

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,910
know shrinking it down but so if we

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:21,750
didn't get in venue well we had to think

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:24,270
of some other way to do it oops okay so

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:27,390
you got this far um then you can start

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:29,970
thinking about costs we know from

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,920
experience that yap see Asia cost about

00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:35,100
a hundred dollars per person per

00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,500
attendee this has always been true for

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,620
some reason so we can estimate how much

00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:46,500
is going to cost so yeah on the dolls

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:52,290
for 2,000 people yeah 200k a lot of

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:54,000
money yeah so so we then you need to

00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:57,320
calculate the money you have to raise

00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,100
right we also know from experience that

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:04,800
each sponsor on average gives us about

00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:07,860
3.5 k dollar force we also know that

00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:13,830
each attendee give us an income of us

00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:18,000
$35 so that means we will get an income

00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:19,860
of about 70 k from ticket sales and we

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,100
have to raise the rest of the hundred

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,950
30k from sponsors which

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,289
means we need about 40 to 50 sponsors

00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:33,740
how many sponsors the FDA have I'm not

00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:35,570
sure 10 2015 okay um this year we we

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:42,919
just got a last one which was microsoft

00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:46,760
and we I think we have 50 so it it's a

00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:51,230
lot of stuff to do so we've got this far

00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:53,900
you know this gives us sort of the

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:56,809
general overall design of where we want

00:18:53,900 --> 00:19:00,530
to go we know who it's for so you know

00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:02,659
that based on that you can you can think

00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:06,530
of what kind of content you want to

00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:09,429
provide to them and all the same time

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:12,679
you know the ballpark costs and stuff so

00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:16,820
you can keep your budget you know under

00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:19,789
control alright and yeah actually the

00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:24,230
second Adam the sub item there is kind

00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:26,840
of important too because since we need

00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,490
to go around 40 to 50 sponsors we need

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,690
to be able to tell them what what

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:35,480
they're in for right and that directly

00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:37,570
correlates to the the whole what what is

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:41,950
this conference about type of thing

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:44,960
anyway well these are all like a

00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:50,720
intermixed together so we'll come back

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:53,799
to that later all right so then we think

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,850
about implementing the conference oops I

00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:57,950
was gonna ask what was the first thing

00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:04,490
you do when you implement a conference

00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:06,409
but it's a team yeah so you I don't know

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:10,940
I know how you guys do it here i'm not

00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:17,030
sure but um the few examples that I've

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:20,600
seen um don't really think of building a

00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,400
team first um they you know they think

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,990
that once somebody raised their hands

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,730
and say you know we're gonna do a

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,350
conference just you know help me and

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,409
everybody's sort of automatic

00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:33,850
automatically comes and helps you and

00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:35,750
you know I don't know that's the sort of

00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:39,050
attitude that I've seen

00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:40,880
so far but with the conference this size

00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:43,780
you kind of have to start with building

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:48,290
the the team and making sure all the

00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:50,990
communication and stuff works so I told

00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:53,540
you about the core staff all right we

00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,910
actually have 12 core stuff right but

00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:59,120
obviously you can't do all everything's

00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:01,060
just 12 people you need people who we're

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:05,210
going to move the chairs or you know

00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:08,030
bring the the boxes full of swags and

00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:10,670
stuff so that that that's the volunteer

00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:13,160
staff people who only work on the day of

00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:15,800
the event all right so we got about 60

00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:19,640
of them this year um and we also have a

00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:22,520
network staff 22 people there um these

00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:27,740
are actually people who build a custom

00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:29,750
Wi-Fi network just for the event well

00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:34,160
all the kudos to them but God they are

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:38,840
costly too I'm gonna talk briefly about

00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:42,290
them later Oh see and so how do i do the

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,930
team management well you know this being

00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:49,340
United States and all all have democracy

00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:54,200
but we actually don't do that I'm the

00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:58,970
dictator I I call the shots this is

00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,830
mainly because everybody works on this

00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:05,210
project part time right they have their

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:06,800
day-to-day jobs and um the most

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,750
important thing that I think about when

00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,180
I when I do is when i do the apps he is

00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:14,900
a to not waste their resources to not

00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:17,690
waste their time so in that sense I

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:20,360
don't think having lengthy discussions

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,700
and and meetings are is is a good thing

00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,520
so I just I just take the responsibility

00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,680
I call the shots you know they work for

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,580
me but I'd like to think I'm the

00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:34,610
benevolent dictator not too selfish

00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:40,370
there hopefully anyway so that's how we

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:44,990
do it and this also relates to the whole

00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:48,860
not wasting resources um this year we

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,789
actually went went through met yet two

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,100
weeks or three extreme

00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:56,929
valuating what tools we want to use to

00:22:52,100 --> 00:23:00,139
make new communication stuff last year

00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:03,220
he was Facebook groups the year before I

00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:07,369
think it was mainly IRC and Facebook

00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:10,759
that kind of stuff they proved to be

00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:15,080
there were some problems and this year

00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:16,850
we thought about it so these are the

00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,200
some of the criterias that we thought

00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:22,369
were important for communication tools

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,590
we have out of the 12 core staff six of

00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:26,899
them are non engineers so it has to be

00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:32,960
easy for nine years that you know what

00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:36,799
that means we're not gonna use IRC but

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,659
these Oh Facebook I'm we are using for

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:43,759
promotion but I'll get to that later

00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:48,320
yeah this is interim yes uh so yeah so I

00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:51,979
rc's out you know no no text protocol

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:57,739
here okay no text cy tools it has to be

00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:59,359
like 21st century type stuff we also

00:23:57,739 --> 00:24:02,450
needed easy mobile access I don't know

00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:06,009
about in here but in japan everybody

00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:09,499
does everything from a smartphone so on

00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:11,119
nobody really use a pc anymore and it

00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:13,940
has to be easy to sign up otherwise they

00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:16,519
just wouldn't start working you know you

00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:19,429
give him/her given instructions to join

00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:21,619
IRC they never do and have to like catch

00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:28,070
them in the go yeah you know type those

00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:29,509
commands right and and lastly it we we

00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,460
deal with a lot of multimedia like

00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:34,249
images and videos and stuff so it has to

00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:39,109
be easy to send these stuff back and

00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:41,720
forth right so it's like I don't know if

00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:46,429
you guys use it for this year um slack

00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:48,769
actually does um cut a it does fulfill

00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:55,970
all the year requirements that we needed

00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:59,090
um yeah I don't know if you use it ever

00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:03,180
you like well not too many people okay

00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:07,470
well I can say the whole signup process

00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:11,190
it's so easy I mean God why didn't we

00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:16,980
have this before right anyway so your

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:19,200
trust um and we use it to mainly to keep

00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,870
the conversation going we don't hold

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,990
discussions here really I mean we do

00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:28,740
when we you know when people are online

00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:32,190
at the same time but the main reason to

00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,670
use this kind of chat tool is to just

00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:38,100
keep the conversation going right you

00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:40,110
tell jokes you you put some many links

00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,350
and stuff and you kind of get to know

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:46,320
each other right because again these are

00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:50,100
part-time stuff we don't work in

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,720
physical each other you know the up we

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,610
if we don't have something like this it

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:58,830
just you know the you don't feel like

00:25:53,610 --> 00:26:00,750
part of team so all right uh there is

00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:03,900
one dar set of slack I have to tell you

00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:07,890
it's too expensive um when you start

00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:14,040
paying for it Jesus Christ oh my god the

00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:16,770
bills are so bad but my tick is 14 this

00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,960
size it's worth it and we do have the

00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:25,410
budget to to to pay for it so that's

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:27,840
okay all right mirc well I think I

00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:31,530
already said pretty much what I want to

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:35,010
say you know it's 2015 right I can't

00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:39,680
force my team members to to use a cui

00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:44,280
based tool or even if the client is GUI

00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:47,880
doesn't work so we didn't really

00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:51,810
consider it other tools that we use he's

00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:54,960
gonna github a lot um github actually

00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:57,390
kind of isn't it's the fine line there

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,580
between you know easy to use for

00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,770
engineers and non-engineers because the

00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,840
engineers obviously can use get the git

00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:06,780
command and it's easy to interface with

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,620
it and for non engineer so you can

00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:12,390
actually use the the web UI to you know

00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,830
view and edit and make new files and

00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,640
everything so they actually have all the

00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:20,430
tools required so

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:23,730
we have been able to manage using this

00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:26,340
these and we use github to to keep track

00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:29,610
of to-do lists with issues and uh we

00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:32,000
also weekly minutes like God the image

00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:34,470
is bad but anyway the these are weekly

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,020
markdown files that gets generated by a

00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:39,420
bot and you just filling what you did

00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:44,550
the past week so I can tell what what

00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:47,340
else I'm missing okay the other thing we

00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:51,420
use Google Drive I i'm sure you guys use

00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:54,360
it here one thing that we consciously

00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:58,230
decided this year was to just share all

00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:01,230
the documents to everybody previously um

00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:03,030
I've been keeping all the financial

00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:06,030
details and and the talks between

00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:07,710
sponsors to myself but this year we

00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:10,050
wanted to really really avoid having a

00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:12,030
single point of failure so what I just

00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:14,400
decided okay you know be discreet about

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:18,030
it but you know I'm just gonna share

00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:21,210
everything you can see it all I think

00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:24,800
this has been a good thing um for

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:27,450
example we actually did have a little

00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:30,000
small Fiasco whoa well like when I came

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:33,540
here um we had a little mix-up with a

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,700
sponsor and uh I couldn't get it get it

00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:38,040
get there in time to fix it so somebody

00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:41,160
went in and looked at the stuff in the

00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:46,230
Google Drive and they fix it so that's

00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:49,620
pretty okay and having described all

00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:53,750
those tools we actually do have meetings

00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:58,580
uh but they're more like drink ups um

00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:04,080
this is sort of the advantage we have

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:07,320
working in Tokyo um so while we don't

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,360
work close together we we we are in the

00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,190
same greater Tokyo area and we can

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,010
always gather onto to have a little

00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:15,480
drink right whereas in ya like ya tiene

00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,070
and everybody's in the west coast and

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,190
east coast and everywhere else so you

00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:21,450
can't really have a physical meeting I

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:24,300
don't think meetings are necessary but

00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,070
if you can't have it um I highly

00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:28,100
recommend drink ups and stuff just to

00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:30,770
get to know each other you know the

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,890
I really don't believe in like work

00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:35,900
meetings like lengthy work meetings

00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:38,570
right you can just share what you've

00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,039
been doing like matter of five minutes I

00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,280
don't think you were like an hour hour

00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:45,410
long of discussions so when we do meet

00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,020
it's just to make sure that we know each

00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:51,500
other and we are part of the team so

00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:54,230
that's why it's always over beers like

00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,970
this yeah japanese fell he's idea if

00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:59,960
you've been to one of those pretty nice

00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:02,299
um I think it's actually very important

00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,280
to this because the your team is what's

00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:12,650
going to differentiate from success and

00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:17,990
failure of your conference okay all

00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:20,750
right this is the venue this year this

00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:23,179
is the venue this is the actual vein we

00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:26,240
are this is the bill that you see here

00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:28,429
it's actually the fifth or sixth floor

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,490
on a six floor seventh floor and eighth

00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:36,020
floor are in that a reverse triangular

00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:41,299
thing okay how many of you here like

00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:42,860
anime and manga this some of you you may

00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:46,850
have heard of this thing called comiket

00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:49,730
which is a what is it a big convention

00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:51,890
for anime manga enthusiasts if you've

00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:54,200
seen people dressing up as you know

00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:57,080
manga characters that that's where the

00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,210
event is actually the comp get itself

00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:02,650
actually happens over there because they

00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:05,330
have a more flat and spacious area but

00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:07,520
usually they use this place for for

00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:10,520
cosplayers to change the clothes into

00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:16,030
the manga characters anyway but they do

00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:18,860
have a big auditorium there so okay so

00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:20,150
think about the venue I already told you

00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,039
that we're going to be having we're

00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:25,010
gonna use that venue but when we are

00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:26,330
preparing to reserve a venue these were

00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,970
some of the things we were thinking

00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:32,179
about and as I said it must have max

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:35,360
capacity about 2,000 people uh it has to

00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:37,130
have several rooms together right you

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,909
can't have just one big auditorium

00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,859
because we want to have multiple track

00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:43,619
right and they have to be physically

00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:46,229
close together this is actually problem

00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:48,200
because um if you want to multiple rooms

00:31:46,229 --> 00:31:51,809
like colleges are not not a bad choice

00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,989
but usually the rooms are kind of far

00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:56,460
apart you have to walk like you know 25

00:31:54,989 --> 00:31:59,279
minutes or whatever which isn't that

00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:04,080
that far but it's enough far enough to

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:07,279
annoy your attendees right what else

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,779
what else oh yeah we have to have a

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,330
space to have the conference dinner for

00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:14,429
six hundred people actually wanted to

00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,950
welcome everybody but it's impossible so

00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:23,359
600 sort of the maxim do we could afford

00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:28,200
uh oh yeah this being in Japan oh now

00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:31,499
that's public transportation this beam

00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,179
Japan um you don't hold conferences in a

00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:35,279
hotel like this so people actually

00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:38,369
commute from their home to the

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,220
conference right so the venue has to be

00:32:38,369 --> 00:32:43,409
at a good location where you can get on

00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:47,909
a public transportation and come come

00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:50,999
and go home right and the it should be

00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:54,299
reasonably priced um the price factor is

00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:57,629
actually kind of hard thing to deal with

00:32:54,299 --> 00:33:03,179
in Tokyo because god they're expensive

00:32:57,629 --> 00:33:06,929
man um see a few years here um well then

00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:14,220
you cost 100 Kate just for two days one

00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:17,309
room God we looked around a lot oh and

00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:22,049
yet even with that you have to have to

00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:26,729
to usually have to reserve two years in

00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:29,789
advance this actually happened on so in

00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:31,830
to fall 2014 we decided to have ya SE

00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:34,139
Asia and we called up and the first

00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:41,309
thing the guy says is like oh is this 4

00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:46,070
2016 or 2017 well anyway looking dear

00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:48,869
actor early that's all really and pray

00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:51,989
we call the butt up about ten locations

00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:52,679
and just you know told them okay if you

00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:55,759
have an opening

00:33:52,679 --> 00:34:10,399
33 consecutive days let us know and

00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:15,359
we'll see so we waited the room one room

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:19,139
one big room like thousand nine hundred

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,309
saw the people so yeah we waited you

00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:23,339
know start thinking maybe this is not

00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:26,970
good idea we may have to think we think

00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:29,669
the size but it's the last one you know

00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:33,419
so we wanted to have a to go with a bang

00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:36,389
and so maybe we had to wait until 2016

00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:38,730
but the phone rings and we're saved for

00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:43,159
some reason somebody canceled so we were

00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:47,010
lucky and so we got this tokyo big sight

00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:49,139
yeah it's a really big venue uh by the

00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:51,179
way all this crowd here is that this is

00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:53,940
for the comp get can't get attracts like

00:34:51,179 --> 00:35:02,849
like two orders of magnitude more people

00:34:53,940 --> 00:35:05,430
so um alright and Jesus Christ I was

00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:07,319
going to show you the venue but there's

00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:09,809
a big auditorium the holes of thousand

00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:12,089
people there's like rooms here and there

00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:15,750
there on the other side this room in

00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:21,450
middle um it you can put in about 500

00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:23,490
people there so uh as the venue spec

00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:30,900
goes you can you can have about 1800

00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:35,339
people at the same time and yeah so this

00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:37,760
venue actually comes with a Wi-Fi we

00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:41,460
talked to them but it just doesn't work

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:44,280
we know it was lahab I think was a 100

00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,450
megabyte uh download speed or something

00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,369
like that I forget I'm not really

00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,710
knowledgeable about this stuff but it

00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:55,440
doesn't work this is this is an event

00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:58,079
for two thousand engineers right two

00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,500
years ago when we had the ab c 2013 um

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:04,980
it was the same day as the latest iOS

00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,240
release everybody started downloading it

00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,150
right

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,310
and that year we already had our custom

00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:14,060
network so we were fine we're actually

00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:17,550
fine but if we didn't oh my god

00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:19,320
everything would have broken down so you

00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,810
need a better network so just build it

00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,960
we're all engineers right so that that's

00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:27,630
what these people are for um they're the

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:33,300
group name is kombu conference network

00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:36,510
builders um I I don't know man that they

00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,130
just love their network they they they

00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:40,020
want to do funky things with it they

00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:41,460
want to try to see how just how many

00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,380
people they can knock up accommodate

00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,990
with their their equipment and other

00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:50,369
than a crazy bunch of people and they

00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:52,950
love it hey we pay for the expenses but

00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:58,820
you know they do all the work and what

00:36:52,950 --> 00:37:02,960
I've worked very very grateful okay um

00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:06,869
all right yeah so that's about the venue

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,970
so we got the venue right but we still

00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:11,450
didn't know if you could pay for it so

00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:16,260
we have to start thinking about money

00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:19,859
yes we have to raise that hundred 30k in

00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,720
order to do that I don't know what what

00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:30,380
do you guys do here yep cna the is there

00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:39,290
any manual or something to a person okay

00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:39,290
see you again oh there is okay uh-huh

00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:04,410
okay let's bring it that's weird all

00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:06,570
right right that you can't complete it

00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:09,900
it's so something that you have to play

00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:11,970
by the year every year so anyway um in

00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,550
order to raise that hundreds 30k what

00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:16,410
what do you really need to do um I think

00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,480
the bottom line is that you just have to

00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:21,000
make sure that it's easy for

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,640
non-engineers not non-gaap see goers to

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,550
grok watch what your conference is about

00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:32,010
and prepare enough materials to you know

00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:34,950
sweet talk to them and the main reason

00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:37,110
is that people who who control the

00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:39,780
budget are not your engineer buddies

00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:42,060
there you know the pointy hair type that

00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:47,250
the you know they don't understand the

00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:50,010
pro from PHP right um so you have to you

00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:52,860
have to prepare stuff for that when we

00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:54,960
did the design stuff we already sort of

00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,430
came up with an abstract of what the

00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,360
conference is gonna be so we kind of

00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:04,380
clear that in this session we what we on

00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:06,840
top of that are visual aids and uh what

00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:10,290
what we call this a sponsorship menu

00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:12,270
right I think in the app CNN a at least

00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:14,160
you have like a platinum sponsorship go

00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:16,020
sponsorship whatever which sort of a you

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,480
know all-inclusive package sort of thing

00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,300
we don't do that um I'll get into that

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,460
later but before creating that menu we

00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:26,750
need all the visual a that we need logos

00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:29,910
all the designing and photos and stuff

00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:33,720
I've been saying this on Twitter and all

00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:36,330
the articles that i write but got ye man

00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,660
where are you design staff man you have

00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:42,350
to do you have to put money here this is

00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,360
where you want to put your money in

00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:48,660
because if you don't only the diehard

00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:51,420
fans of your conference will notice you

00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:54,510
right you want newbies you want more

00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:56,790
calm more sponsors to take note

00:39:54,510 --> 00:40:00,060
notice of your conference then you need

00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:03,450
a good looking site and material all the

00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:09,030
materials right thank you thank you

00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:11,040
hahaha so you know when you look at this

00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,960
and the balance sheet it's really

00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,120
depressing but still it's worth every

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,210
penny this is really where you want to

00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:20,520
put you start putting your money in so

00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:22,350
first things we did were like it Keesey

00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,570
site the moment we knew that we had a

00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,820
venue we ask the designer to just put a

00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:28,350
put up a site you know declaring when

00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:31,650
it's going to be where it's going to be

00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:34,760
right this is also a good thing to do

00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:37,140
because it avoids a schedule conflict

00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,520
you know if you're the first one to

00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,020
raise your hand and say we're going to

00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:45,540
hold a conference in August twentieth

00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:48,570
nobody else will so we also have a logo

00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:51,480
set I mean this doesn't come out good

00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:53,100
but it's all vector graphics you can use

00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,810
it for anything you want you can create

00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,700
normal abilities and and the

00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:59,910
professional grade printing material out

00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:03,260
of this and in fact we are going to make

00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:07,140
this kind of cup thing as part of the

00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:09,180
memorabilia for our attendees and it's

00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:11,460
you know the only reason we can do this

00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:18,150
because we have real professional grade

00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:19,680
design material one thing at least this

00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,500
year's the FCN a seems to be missing is

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,450
a good ogp image you know the image that

00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:27,300
you get when you share stuff on it on

00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:29,400
his facebook and twitter right actually

00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:33,900
when i complained about it to gene heck

00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:35,190
he somehow got it but still I it should

00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,710
have been there from the very beginning

00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:42,180
we had this from from from day one okay

00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:44,640
um cuz again we are in 21st century when

00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,800
you have shares on on your Twitter and

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,770
Facebook right you don't want to just

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:56,190
the eight a tag right you want a picture

00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:59,900
a description all that stuff and after

00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:03,680
that finally this is our sponsor menu I

00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:06,840
included this in this section right

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,540
after all the design stuff because we

00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,850
don't

00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:12,610
expect our sponsors to look at our

00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:17,710
sponsor menu if it's just a you know of

00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:21,150
a letter sized piece of paper that has

00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:24,810
letters only we actually make a pretty

00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:28,600
menu right so that it's easy to tell

00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:31,030
what the we are asking out of the

00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:33,250
sponsors and what the sponsorship menu

00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:34,960
is it's basically like little items like

00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:37,240
official conference t-shirt you can

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,880
sponsor the t-shirt you can sponsor to

00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,740
have your your logo and a back panel a

00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,170
back panel is one of those things where

00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:45,910
you you know put in the back of the

00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:48,550
speaker so you know you've seen in like

00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:51,490
TV interviews right you see the sponsor

00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:54,880
names no this is actually our killer

00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:57,940
menu menu item this you get a lot of

00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,310
money out of this okay everybody wants

00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,900
to pay for it we have stuff like you

00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:04,510
know sponsorship for the Wi-Fi

00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:08,290
infrastructure stuff and everything else

00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:11,320
did this sponsorship menu is actually

00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:13,480
about eight pages long it's got a lot of

00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,850
stuff and so we don't do platinum

00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,620
sponsorship type of thing yeah if the

00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:20,590
sponsor wants the sponsor basically gets

00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:23,200
to decide what they want to put them

00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:27,580
their money for where their names appear

00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:32,410
like I've thing okay so we asked

00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:35,280
designer to to come up with this all

00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:38,980
right and one thing I'm missing again

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,900
photos man if you look at the twitter

00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,150
feed for yap cna I'm like the only one

00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:48,940
putting photos well there are some

00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:52,450
people but you know this is not too too

00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:55,000
so that you you uh this is not for real

00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:57,640
time shares or anything like that but if

00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,460
you're gonna continue holding you event

00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:03,910
right how do you explain how the

00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:08,050
previous year was without like having

00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:10,030
actual photos right I mean sure you can

00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:11,860
have this video of heat in one up but

00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:14,800
your sponsors are not going to watch

00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:17,140
your talk right they they want to see

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,430
what the atmosphere is they don't they

00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:21,090
don't care about what with technical

00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:24,560
material talking about right so

00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:27,540
you really should have photos um we

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,910
started from 2009 we started hiring a

00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:32,100
professional photographer to take all

00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:34,020
these pictures god this is bad yeah

00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:39,450
anyway the original pictures are much

00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:41,640
better um we have everything from 2009

00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:43,980
and we can just show it to all the

00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,500
sponsors saying look this is what we do

00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:49,130
and look at the faces of these people

00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:53,040
come to our event they love it right um

00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:55,260
oh by the way that you see that that's

00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,540
done cuz i right you see the panel

00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:01,070
behind behind him that's the back panel

00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:06,720
thing and again this pays a lot of money

00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:08,610
all right yeah more pictures um you

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,810
really really should have professional

00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:15,210
grade pictures it pays photographer

00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:18,390
Forza aren't expensive they're really

00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:22,080
cheap compared to the actual impact that

00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:31,140
you get out of these pictures ok so you

00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:33,450
should uh alright so if you got this far

00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:35,700
then you know we have stuff to convince

00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:38,340
her talk to go to talk to our sponsors

00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:40,920
now we have visual aid we have the

00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:43,530
actual you know the abstract of what

00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:46,500
we're trying to achieve we can tell the

00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:50,300
sponsors what kind of conference their

00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:52,650
name is going to be associated with so

00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:55,050
the only problem for me I have to go

00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:58,650
talk to all 50 of those sponsors which I

00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:02,280
did it was a pain and had to explain

00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:04,500
over and over what yaps he was so but

00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:13,440
after the the fifth one or so you start

00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:15,900
memorizing all your lines so hey ok so

00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,950
you go to your sponsors you start

00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,790
getting your money right next step I

00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:24,470
haven't talked anything about the

00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:26,760
contents of the conference all right

00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:30,960
speakers you know that that's that's

00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:33,090
what the makes a difference yes I know

00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:39,330
that but I yeah

00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:41,910
so what do we do the secret ingredient

00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:46,470
EFC Asia is yep see Asia is not a pro

00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:50,280
conference no it's it's a conference a

00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:53,550
tech conference biased towards pearl we

00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:55,830
actually don't ask for products we ask

00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:59,750
for interesting talks for engineers and

00:46:55,830 --> 00:47:05,070
if it's about about pearl it's better

00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:09,380
but we don't ask for it ok part of the

00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:13,680
reason is well you know um it's hard to

00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:16,290
have an interesting conference multiple

00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:20,850
day multi day conference talking about

00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:24,270
one specific technology the other reason

00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:29,160
is again is 2015 I don't think too many

00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:31,170
systems are made of one language and the

00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,900
moment you start limiting yourself to

00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:35,790
Jasper oh you kind of start losing you

00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:38,580
know all those really interesting

00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:43,730
candidates we we really want to have

00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:45,990
those Candace and um our mission

00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:47,760
starting from 2000 line when I took over

00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:51,090
was not necessarily to promote

00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,490
proto-language well what we were trying

00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:56,730
to do was to promote pearl the culture

00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:59,280
pearl the community and this was a great

00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:02,640
way to do that because a lot of people

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,530
for the people that the usually do Ruby

00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,180
stuff PHP stuff you know they might have

00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:08,220
something interesting to say but they

00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:11,070
don't come to the pro conference because

00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:12,870
it's pearl right it's such a waste a

00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:15,210
they we have a good community we have a

00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:18,180
good good culture we want to share that

00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:21,870
to people who don't otherwise care for

00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:26,400
pearl right so that's how we kind of

00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:30,690
shifted the event and for the proposals

00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:33,120
um I think we we do this kind of in a

00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:36,450
very unique way we don't have a

00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:38,790
selection process the closed selection

00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:41,850
process when you submit your talk to you

00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:45,720
ab c asia it's immediately public in a

00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:47,660
pending state right so anybody can see

00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,700
it

00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:52,739
part of the reason is well you know we

00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:54,450
wanted to sort of share beforehand what

00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:56,430
kind of people are submitting our talks

00:48:54,450 --> 00:49:01,069
but the other reason is we wanted the

00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:05,130
the speakers to to promote their talks

00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:09,140
via Twitter Facebook whatever so that

00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:12,450
gets back to the earlier question and uh

00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:16,349
yeah we heavily use that for promotion

00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:17,999
um it seriously this is automatic

00:49:16,349 --> 00:49:20,160
promotion people want to get accepted

00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:22,259
right they start like feeding their

00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,180
talks to to all these places they write

00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:27,930
blogs about it and I don't have to do

00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:32,069
anything to promote a teenager hey works

00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:35,400
for me then the actual talks election

00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:38,700
takes place we you know we start reading

00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,710
the abstract and obviously the abstract

00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:43,710
is what counts the most so if it's not

00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:46,109
interesting we don't we don't take it

00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:48,809
but if you have multiple talks that are

00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:50,989
but as interesting as the other the next

00:49:48,809 --> 00:49:54,869
thing we consider our number of shares

00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:58,789
because we assume that that many people

00:49:54,869 --> 00:50:02,539
were interesting that subject okay and

00:49:58,789 --> 00:50:05,519
if you have a tie even after that then

00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:08,460
it's time for to use the Pearl no pearl

00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:15,569
if it's about Pearl it wins otherwise

00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:17,789
well we can reconsider right um we also

00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:19,759
have the this guest and featured speaker

00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:23,150
stuff I don't know did you guys actually

00:50:19,759 --> 00:50:27,749
invite speakers for a free app CN a

00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:29,609
little yeah okay well um we we usually

00:50:27,749 --> 00:50:34,440
have three years old speakers some

00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:39,329
foreign speakers to in we buy them talk

00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:42,630
a at the app see um and again we just in

00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:44,609
this is where since we don't have to

00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:47,479
restrict ourselves to pearl um this is

00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:50,910
where the organizers I get to have fun

00:50:47,479 --> 00:50:53,130
this year we I just I just invited brad

00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:56,219
fitzpatrick of memcache tea and a goal

00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:57,029
fame just cuz i want to talk to talk to

00:50:56,219 --> 00:51:02,419
him

00:50:57,029 --> 00:51:06,630
so uh and uh this year we actually

00:51:02,419 --> 00:51:14,429
inviting 10 guests total including mats

00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:17,099
of ruby in a taxi so let's see and other

00:51:14,429 --> 00:51:20,519
content unlike yep cna we don't have

00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:25,289
classes we tried once it just didn't

00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:27,479
work out it was really hard to get extra

00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:30,869
rooms and not too many people signed up

00:51:27,479 --> 00:51:34,409
for so we haven't been doing that since

00:51:30,869 --> 00:51:38,279
then if the sponsors want to hold some

00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:39,599
extra sessions special sessions we work

00:51:38,279 --> 00:51:41,699
with them to make that happen but

00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:47,849
otherwise most of the content is just

00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:50,369
you know talks miscellaneous stuff Oh

00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:52,289
everybody loved this one if you know if

00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:56,369
you have been Oh yep co-organizer act

00:51:52,289 --> 00:52:00,689
the ACT via the the software runs the

00:51:56,369 --> 00:52:04,199
yachty sites um we've used at for 2,000

00:52:00,689 --> 00:52:07,409
up to two thousand nine and then I

00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:10,169
decided uh uh dis network main reason

00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:12,059
was not tech nothing technical really it

00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:14,579
was the fact that it was a hosted

00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:16,319
service and I couldn't just have my

00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:19,039
designer go in and change all the

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:22,409
templates and stuff it was too hard to

00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:25,409
tell tell tell them how to change it

00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:33,719
templates and stuff did just didn't work

00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:36,869
out so what we did since we are pearl

00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:40,650
conference sort of we chose movable type

00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:43,019
instead of word press to Two Holy all

00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:44,839
the static content and other than that

00:52:43,019 --> 00:52:50,489
we just we just have a really really

00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:54,119
bare bones set of psg I applications to

00:52:50,489 --> 00:52:58,169
do all the dynamics stuff and ticketing

00:52:54,119 --> 00:53:00,779
we just outsource it so like this year

00:52:58,169 --> 00:53:03,390
we just have to two tabs there that's

00:53:00,779 --> 00:53:05,749
dynamic everything else else is from

00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,749
movable type

00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:13,829
ticketing I again you know this ghost

00:53:10,799 --> 00:53:17,190
was there all the whole act stuff I you

00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:20,549
know again it's 2015 there are services

00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:23,910
that handle this very very well just

00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:27,539
also sources we use a service called

00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:29,009
ptex um that's mainly based in Japan

00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:31,979
there they also active in the United

00:53:29,009 --> 00:53:33,390
States on their written we part of the

00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:36,239
reason we chose that is because they're

00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:43,019
written in perl too but uh anyway it

00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:45,839
works uh yeah timing is everything but

00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:48,719
this is sort of stuff that only somebody

00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:50,190
who has organized it would understand so

00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:54,799
if you're in organizing you want to know

00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:54,799
how we time things come talk to me um

00:53:55,579 --> 00:54:01,890
balance sheet I actually want to share

00:53:58,289 --> 00:54:05,549
my balance sheets so bad because I got a

00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:07,079
very cool bouncy it's a Google

00:54:05,549 --> 00:54:08,459
spreadsheet that does it you know the

00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:11,400
old calculations automatically you can

00:54:08,459 --> 00:54:14,849
tell you exactly um you know if you're

00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,319
in the right or not but I can't just

00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:21,269
show it to you here if you're interested

00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:26,219
come find me later um oh and we actually

00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:28,890
do do some arm not heavy but we do

00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:30,690
consistent the advertisements almost

00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:35,309
every month we have some sort of article

00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:40,229
or sponsorship the going to advertise

00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:43,440
our event there's a site called geek ljp

00:54:40,229 --> 00:54:45,420
with it's like I don't know what the

00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,180
equivalent is in the United States but

00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:52,259
the their tech journal they do paper

00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:54,630
book actual paper general and a website

00:54:52,259 --> 00:54:58,079
and we we have regular installments

00:54:54,630 --> 00:55:01,650
there um to talk about how we're doing

00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:04,920
and if you know what mia has been up to

00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:07,430
lately he's being he pretty much changed

00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:10,499
jobs from a programmer to a podcaster um

00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:13,319
and so his podcasts are actually really

00:55:10,499 --> 00:55:17,309
really a the popular in Japan at least

00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:20,279
so we just sponsored his a podcast and

00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:21,680
go in and say hey we're holding at the

00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:27,480
edger come

00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:29,310
alright alright so wrap up um you should

00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,260
have the grand design um you know you

00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:34,950
can't you're not going anywhere unless

00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:39,420
you know where you going um so you gotta

00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:41,760
start their staff I really want to

00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,170
emphasize that the you shouldn't take

00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,970
your staff for granted you got to treat

00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:46,590
them well you got to feed them and you

00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:48,960
got to make sure that they feel like

00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:51,180
part of the team and a lot of people

00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,740
that I've seen holding this kind of

00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:57,840
conference fails to do this um

00:55:54,740 --> 00:56:00,840
communication is really really important

00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:03,360
more so than you know the so far my

00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:05,820
bullet points have have all almost been

00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:08,400
stuff that doesn't have anything to do

00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:12,780
with talk or the actual conference

00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:14,100
itself it and I believe these things are

00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:17,810
much more important than the actual

00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:19,800
talks so that's what I'm saying it

00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:23,940
outsourced it you don't have to do

00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:26,250
everything by yourself um up now not

00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:28,790
outsourcing our solution it includes

00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:31,880
using stuff like act you don't have to

00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:35,910
you don't have to feel the pain of using

00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:41,190
this software um just let somebody else

00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:44,730
do it for you right and finally use the

00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:46,230
web I keep saying this it's 2015 this

00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:48,780
you know if you're looking for some

00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:52,460
service you sure to find something on

00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:55,410
the web so um use it use it use it

00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:59,030
that's that's that will save you a lot

00:56:55,410 --> 00:57:03,030
of time and effort so all right and

00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:06,440
finally I might have scared you away but

00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:09,720
I started it without knowing anything

00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:12,690
some reason I I grew the conference from

00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:16,800
about 200 people to 2,000 people so hey

00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:19,599
you can do it all right all right I'm

00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:22,599
done I mean questions

00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,599
yes

00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:43,760
so right so the question is the average

00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:46,400
cost for four per attendee attendee if

00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,960
it has to be the same um so I'm not

00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,570
exactly sure about the very early days

00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,310
when we had we started out 200 people

00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:53,660
not because I was in the organizer and I

00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:57,410
wasn't controlling all the financial

00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:59,840
stuff but since we I started and then I

00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:02,840
started taking these notes from the

00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:05,510
second year and at least from 2010 it's

00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:09,520
been that way for some reason it bounces

00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:14,630
out to be like that too silent air was

00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:22,070
400 or 500 something like that yeah yes

00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:24,500
oh the question is if you serving food

00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:28,010
or coffee so there's the free dinner

00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:32,410
conference dinner which is free uh that

00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:39,170
actually costs like oh how much is that

00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:40,790
sixty dollars per person uh x 600 but

00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:44,060
that's about the extent of money that we

00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:46,040
have to pay for for food mainly because

00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:49,490
these venues don't allow you to serve

00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:51,230
food unfortunately you know looking at

00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:54,050
baby the stuff that you got there the

00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:56,930
the fruits and all the drinks I'm really

00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:59,030
envious I wish I could do it but the

00:58:56,930 --> 00:59:02,720
venue won't allow us but this year we do

00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:12,940
serve coffee that we force them to

00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:12,940
accept it so hey welcome to you to Japan

00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:23,930
t3t well no I wish you could do that

00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,270
again you know generally these places

00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:30,620
don't alive bringing any sort of food or

00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:31,730
drinks this year we really last year is

00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:35,800
the first year that we actually had

00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:41,390
endless um Phoebe we filled style coffee

00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:43,670
we had to push it so hard and teach

00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:46,970
yeah and this year again we're going to

00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:49,400
have it but again it really depends on

00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:59,480
if you can negotiate your way through so

00:59:49,400 --> 01:00:01,370
yes how what percentage of my our budget

00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:05,690
do we spend on advertising not a whole

01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:09,140
lot um the the articles that we install

01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:11,480
the it's basically sort of free oh ok

01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:14,030
it's basically free because we write it

01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:18,020
we don't get paid um and they want

01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:20,720
content so they just take it for uh the

01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:22,820
podcasts I could tell you but me I

01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,260
probably wouldn't appreciate it so I'm

01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:28,760
not gonna say you don't pay how much I

01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:30,800
paid it looks like we're about out of

01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:33,410
time if there's anything else you want

01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:37,690
you want to get out of me uh let me know

01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:37,690
