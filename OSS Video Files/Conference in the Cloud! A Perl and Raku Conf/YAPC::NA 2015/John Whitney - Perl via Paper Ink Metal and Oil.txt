louder is that good

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:36,880
okay we're going to start my name is

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,260
John Whitney and now we're going to go

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,340
through a lot of slides about a hundred

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,960
and so we're going to go quick and so I

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,670
want you guys to keep up with me I have

00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:50,290
my assistant here stephen and steven has

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,200
taken a day out of school to come here

00:02:50,290 --> 00:03:00,070
how many more days you have to go okay

00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:03,040
bye okay so if you're here for in-depth

00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,170
pearl that's the wrong room we're ready

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,080
to get to pearl source filters

00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:09,430
mojolicious c-span modules but we're

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,270
going to cover a few other exciting

00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:16,420
things first my name is John Whitney got

00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,860
a computer engineering degree in 1980

00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,170
and i'm still in software development

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:26,410
today I already introduced you to my

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,750
technical assistant Stephen and in the

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:34,290
beginning you probably all know what the

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:38,370
first computer was it was Emmerich and

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,370
we're going to join that world

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:12,709
well the stupid machine mistake she made

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:15,959
is she used pro 5 and not pearl 6 so

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:17,370
even back then they had problems and it

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,590
was a much more exciting time we're

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,770
going to enter that time so two years

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:26,250
ago I asked myself would it be possible

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:29,060
to mix old and new in a way that would

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:31,800
be useful and that my kids could use and

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,190
so who here today I'm going to ask a few

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,590
questions who here no knows what or knew

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:41,570
what a teletype was well quite a few of

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:44,970
you and who here has seen one working

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:48,990
fair number who has used one in their

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,970
work oh we got one okay so he he and I

00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,370
he and I are the only two ever used on

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,590
and work here and then let my last

00:04:53,370 --> 00:05:01,500
question is who here is a member of like

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:03,330
an employee club what okay you'll see

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,199
how that's important when we when we go

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:10,560
later but the goal was to get this

00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:13,770
talking to the Internet cloud and you

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,930
know to get news weather email and so

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,330
the goal here was the bridge we're

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,449
actually bridge in 60 50 years of

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,479
technology in 1964 this product came out

00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:29,099
the teletype ASCII teletype and now

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:31,259
we're in 2015 so all the components to

00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:34,380
make all this work basically you have

00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:37,050
terminals you have converters to get

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,669
those terminals to talk to a linux

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,500
machine and then you have the linux

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:42,690
machine who need a little bit of custom

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,030
software that so it could then talk to

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,340
the cloud and get everything back to the

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:51,000
terminals and so forth so we have a

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:55,080
complete loop between these so the

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,280
teletype terminals why teletypes well it

00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,560
turns out

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,320
the teletype company pushed electro

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,660
mechanical design to its limit and there

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,550
was almost pure genius and many things

00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:10,880
they did with clutches and mechanical

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,880
mechanisms to do functions and so forth

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,200
they were the first IO devices for some

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,840
of the very early computers I mean these

00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,889
devices were used when there were no

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,070
computers and they were just

00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:24,660
communicating over phone lines and later

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,240
they were adapted to computers because

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,560
they were just there the other thing

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,120
that's interesting is these machines

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,400
will still be running a hundred years

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,050
from now they're basically

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,460
electromechanical there's very few

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,500
there's like one transistor in there a

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,910
huge one and maybe a couple resistors

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,950
but there's almost nothing in there

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:45,300
that's digital so the goal here for our

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,270
terminals as they had to be able to

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,970
print type and read and punch paper tape

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,220
and I needed two of them because they

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,660
have two kids and they should be

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,490
identical so that we're preventing

00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,860
arguments from the kids all yours is

00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,510
better than mine and they had to be

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,310
fairly lightweight they had to be under

00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,580
70 pounds so we could get them up and

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:08,330
down the stairs so what was available so

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:14,039
in our house in the garage we have these

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:16,380
model 35k SRS these are workhorse

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:18,240
machines that are run 24 hours a day the

00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,070
one that says octopus was on a system

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,280
that was used at Lawrence Livermore labs

00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:26,190
in California but they don't have paper

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,800
tape punch so they're useless these

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,210
machines there are 35 asrs automatic

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,210
send and receive but the problem with

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,530
these is they weigh 220 pounds and it's

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,200
a little hard to get them up and down

00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:40,169
the stairs they do have the paper tape

00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,030
and punch though so then we had these

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:44,430
under the stairs these are the teletype

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,560
33s and I said okay these are perfect

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:50,640
they weigh 70 pounds they have paper

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,200
tape punch and they can print so they'll

00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,590
need to be restored though they've been

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,669
sitting there for a while about 10 years

00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,229
so you might ask yourself well where

00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:02,280
could i get one of these machines well

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:04,590
they come up on ebay about 5-10 times a

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,919
year and they range in price from 500 to

00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,670
three thousand dollars this one sold in

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,490
March 2014 is about you

00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,380
go for twenty three hundred dollars and

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,260
it was a I believe it was a

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:20,560
non-functioning one but it was in good

00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,000
fair Lee good condition so what do you

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,830
do to restore one you basically

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,540
completely take it apart and these

00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,640
machines were designed to be serviced I

00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,920
mean they have manuals here that you can

00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,600
look at everything is discussed and

00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,370
explain where to oil how to take it

00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,380
apart how to put it back together what

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,020
you need to worry about and it's for

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,060
it's quite modular too and you can see I

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,979
have most of the pieces taken apart here

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,290
and as you go through it you're just

00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:47,920
looking for anything that's bad and in

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:50,200
this particular product it had you can

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,730
see cracks on this belt so that belts

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,860
going to have to be changed and on this

00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,680
one you notice there's a tooth missing

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,260
on that gear when I pulled that out so

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,940
the question is where do you get parts

00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:04,420
well it pays to have a spare parts

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,480
machine or it pays to know this man this

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:10,240
is Paul he's in California and he has

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,950
millions of parts literally millions of

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,750
parts he's been in the business of

00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:17,140
repairing these machines for over 40

00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:19,210
years and every little part you can

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,110
imagine he's got now he doesn't have

00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,150
everything because you're getting

00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,250
there's no new supply but almost

00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:29,620
everything he has and he has tons of

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:31,540
knowledge this stack up here goes about

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,950
twice that way it's all manuals on how

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,750
to repair the machines okay so this is

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,550
the side of the keyboard and just give

00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,100
you an example this keyboard has over a

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,540
hundred oiling points and you but you

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,250
got to make sure that none of the oil

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,290
touches in here because it will short

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,110
out these circuits so you got to be very

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,330
careful what you're doing these are the

00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,860
the feet somebody decided they would

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,160
spray-paint it and just took all that

00:09:53,860 --> 00:10:00,730
off you i restored their ribbons by just

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,090
reincke enum then you start putting

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,980
everything back together and it pays to

00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:08,050
put everything in numbered bags so just

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,490
reverse order you take what's in that

00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,370
numbered bagged and you pretty much can

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,800
figure out where it goes and another

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,660
nice thing to do is these rolling

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,160
platforms are extremely helpful you can

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,390
turn the Machine around it's very easy

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,870
to work you don't want to work on a

00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,300
fixed fixed platform and the kids were

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,600
getting

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,360
curious what was I doing and this is

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,519
that same machine now restore this is a

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,529
brand new belt it's got a gear from

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,010
another machine and you can see how it's

00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:39,080
quite cleaned up now and these are the

00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,760
cut looks inside these are actually

00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:44,660
called code bars and they go up and down

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:47,839
to do the 8-bit ASCII characters this is

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,579
an example of the oiling that you have

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,829
to do there's 50 pages of oiling

00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:53,810
instructions this is half a one page and

00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:56,630
it just tells you you've got to put oil

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:58,070
d you keep it dry and another one is g

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,380
where you put grease and those are the

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:04,430
three things oh d and g and everything

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:08,810
was labeled so i started rolling and

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:10,579
greasing everything and now i finally

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,050
had it working this took me about six

00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:15,589
months and then I you know buttoned it

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,390
all up and this one was done ok but I

00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:19,010
need a second one so going to restore a

00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:23,240
second but I'm not going to go into so

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:24,890
much detail and this machine the second

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,140
one i restored here was almost brand new

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,800
so it was very easy to do and we're

00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:32,180
going to do one historical tangent

00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,470
here's an example of the keyboard

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,450
remember I said there was a hundred

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,640
oiling points if you can look every one

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,649
of these things has a requirement to be

00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,850
oiled and every time you turn these on

00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,529
if they've been sitting for a while you

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,029
got to like hit all the keys get them

00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:47,149
all working again before you really try

00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:48,740
to do some productive programming you

00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:50,720
don't want to drop anything on this

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,339
keyboard when it's in this state because

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,730
it's really hard to get all those keys

00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:58,100
look back lined up again and the kitchen

00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:01,339
sink was you'll wash central we washed

00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,110
all the parts you can see this is a

00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:06,199
newer design actually put a plastic

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,329
cover here to prevent oil from getting

00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:10,520
on those contexts the machines are

00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:12,050
constantly being oiled it was there was

00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,990
every month the guy would come out and

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,670
Rio a machine and so oil was always

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,770
flowing around in the air on these

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:21,260
machines in fact underneath machine is a

00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:22,940
is a foam pad just to soak up the oil

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,209
and every now and then you'd lift out

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:30,949
the machine and replace the foam foam

00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:32,720
pad this is the keyboard restore it's

00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:34,579
basically brand new what's nice is this

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,270
white plastic goes all the way down

00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:38,220
about a quarter of an inch

00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,590
so you never have to worry about the

00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,390
letters wearing off on your keys the

00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,620
keys will can wor down we're down eighth

00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:48,870
of an inch you'll still be able to know

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:50,700
what the H key so my first question for

00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:54,570
a ward we have awards for you here these

00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,610
are 30 punch cards from Los Alamos

00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:00,990
National Labs and they make great

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:03,180
bookmarks so and I don't want anyone to

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,770
answer who knows the who's been to my

00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,800
presentation before knows what this is

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:09,930
but can you guess what this is is in a

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:16,320
publication from teletype what what is

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:28,650
this you think programmers teletype

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:33,240
operators top employees okay lies let's

00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:39,510
close it turns out every year teletype

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:41,250
had an employee beauty contest so Steven

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:47,340
give the gentleman with the executive

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:50,250
wise give him the of the award right so

00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,830
what happened is each year they call it

00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,750
the tell Appel queen contest and what

00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,670
they did is they had 6,000 employees and

00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,740
they would nominate who they wanted for

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,750
their nomination they'd get about 150

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,670
recommendations and then they would

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,850
narrow that down to the most popular

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:08,640
allows 150 and then they would have

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,320
those ten finalists actually tore the

00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,000
factory floors and the employees could

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,010
meet them in the various buildings and

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,310
then the employees would vote for five

00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:19,800
finalists and then they were awarded the

00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,360
grand or the tell appel queen at an

00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,170
annual ball that they held every year

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,300
and here's an example in 1962 these are

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,040
the ten ladies who were in that year and

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:34,530
it shows them going through the factory

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:37,380
floors and this is not sure what your

00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:39,030
this is I have 265 these are the five

00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,310
finalists here and they even went to

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:43,220
where teletype paid for all their gowns

00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:46,050
paid for them to go to the beauty parlor

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:49,290
just did the whole thing and then they

00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,630
announced it at the ball and one of the

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,720
things

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:54,880
winning was the ladies pitcher was put

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,610
on the parking pass so where if you were

00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,990
driving around Chicago oh there they

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,610
work a teletype so in addition to that

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:06,840
they became a representative of the

00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:11,650
company and this is a lady who won in

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:17,140
1965 and he or she is teller e touring

00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:18,640
some customers and you guys may not know

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,760
who this is but this is the ringleader

00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:25,810
of Bozo the Clown and they actually paid

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,000
this man to do the MC of the Christmas

00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:31,900
party every year in Chicago for teletype

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,510
corporation so back to the teletype that

00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:38,020
is one little tangent this is teletype

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:39,340
to it's completely restored this here i

00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,350
just want to show you that's a bell

00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:49,090
stephen can you turn that on and ring

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:51,220
that Bell a few times that is much

00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,440
better than these little ringtones you

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,330
get but in the old days and a news

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,060
bulletin would come in if there was ten

00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:00,070
rings it would mean Kennedy was shot or

00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,200
a war had started but it was like two

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:04,120
rings it was a much smaller article so

00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,860
people could know you're sitting in the

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,870
office there's ten rings oh that's a

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,340
really hot story and so the news people

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:13,450
would go off and pull it off and read it

00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:15,460
on the on the radio for the second award

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:17,980
and we're going to pass one of these out

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:22,450
can I have someone guess what this

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:25,180
device is inside the teletype yeah and

00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:29,430
oh so they can see them okay some

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:32,970
guesses yes ink squeegee oh that's good

00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,970
are you gentlemen

00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,560
okay tape feeder more guesses come on

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:47,530
this is for an award twenty thirty 30

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:59,860
los alamos national cards yes feed

00:16:47,530 --> 00:17:01,270
roller you're very very close the last

00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:08,410
one we're going to make you the winter

00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:12,010
so Stephen give him he basically said

00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:14,440
the key words it transmits and then he

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,570
was very close but what it is was called

00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,270
the answer back mechanism and you could

00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:22,930
program in these devices to when you do

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,030
hit the answer key that it would print

00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:27,880
out a 20 character message so I had like

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:31,060
a 20 character buffer and these pins

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:34,630
here right here these are each one of

00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:37,060
these rows is for a ski bit combination

00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:39,460
so you break off the pins to represent

00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,140
an ascii value so what it would do is

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,270
people would have a tape and they would

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,710
dial a number in Chicago and that

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,170
machine in Chicago if they hit the

00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,640
answer back key the Chicago mean machine

00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,830
would play this little loop and they'd

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,830
say oh that really is a Chicago machine

00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:57,400
at saying Chicago 713 so it was a way to

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:59,020
get a little bit of security on who it

00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,000
is you were callin and really wasn't the

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,180
machine you were expecting so that's

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,540
called the answer back key and you can

00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:09,100
see it right here and it when you press

00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,390
a button and you can come up here later

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,370
and press it once you once you turn down

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:15,330
on in local mode and press that button

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,330
hit the answer back

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:22,179
okay now turn off basically just plays

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,220
that thing so what we did is for these

00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:25,900
machines I program with with his name

00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,159
and my other sons name so whenever

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,690
they're doing a letter or something and

00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:32,950
just hit that key and it prints out

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:36,460
their name so now this terminal is done

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,870
so now we have two terminals and I'll

00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,480
just show you a little bit of literature

00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,159
this was the very first ASCII device

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,900
that this company came out with and you

00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:45,970
guys I just came from the what is my

00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,429
name talk where they were talking about

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:51,039
you know unicode this unicode that and

00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:55,090
these and these planes and all that same

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,620
world existed 50 years ago and so they

00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,880
solved it by coming out with a ski

00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,270
before a ski there was literally

00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,610
hundreds of machine codes UNIVAC used

00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,559
one IBM used five or six different ones

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,270
then you had NCR and then you had deck

00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:09,669
and then you had they are all using

00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:12,490
different codes we need a standard so in

00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:16,179
1963 they finally got it right and they

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:21,850
did the ASCII standard so ask he's taken

00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:23,230
for granted today and before they went

00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:25,419
to ask you they were actually working in

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,270
Bordeaux mode which was a 5-bit

00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:32,500
character code and just to give you an

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:34,360
example they had 60 characters that they

00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,549
could use in the five bit mode so my

00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:40,000
question for you guys for another award

00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:46,299
is how did they get 60 characters in

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:49,270
just five bits multiple alphabets shift

00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:50,799
codes yeah okay I'm going to go with the

00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,380
shift code Stephen you got to give this

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,570
gentleman some los alamos national oh

00:19:53,380 --> 00:20:00,549
stephen those are IBM cards let's give

00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:04,809
him the lost animals cards well you know

00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:09,159
they're fine the los alamos ones are

00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:11,169
more exciting but what they did is they

00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:13,360
use what was called chief code so you

00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:17,230
had two to the fifth and five bits so

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,830
you got 32 possible bit combinations 32

00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:22,840
s on enough for even 26 letters and 10

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:25,840
digits so you take away two characters

00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,669
to do shifting and now you have two sets

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,850
of 30 characters plus to shift

00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:31,220
characters

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:33,320
and actually what they did is this is a

00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,600
null and they had both of those in both

00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,110
codes and they had the letters and then

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:42,140
they had line feed space care u-turn and

00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:44,450
then this is letters and then figures as

00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,970
to how they called the two sets so if

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,710
you were doing text you could still do

00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,820
spaces and carriage return in line feeds

00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,200
you didn't have to switch to the other

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:57,320
mode but as soon as you switch the

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:59,150
numbers you could also do spaces so they

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,500
tried to optimize if you're in one mode

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,810
or the other but it was very confusing

00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,010
you know they the teletype ivories head

00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,930
say all I'm going to do a letter now and

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,950
they have to head a figures are letters

00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,570
key and then all I'm going to do a

00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:12,340
number i got to do in numbers key and it

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:16,190
was very because he was a great

00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:18,740
advancement for them and they did

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:20,930
giveaways for a ski so here we have

00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,700
these paper tape punch cards so you

00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,080
could read the tape holes and they had

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,870
pictures on him so these were like

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:31,040
marketing devices to sell a ski and this

00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:34,340
card showed you if you wanted to t you

00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,140
you could figure out the the bits or how

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,580
or the tape was punched so if you were

00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:43,090
looking at the tape you could say oh

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:45,680
that's a tee and teletype made about

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:48,290
700,000 of these machines this

00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,790
particular model the five hundred

00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:52,120
thousands of machine they played it in

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:55,910
gold and they put it in their museum and

00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,220
in 1976 which was the bicentennial year

00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:00,500
they did I think for the seven hundred

00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,240
thousandth machine they painted it in

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,470
red white and blue and had it go around

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,300
the country there might be I would guess

00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,340
a thousand of these machines left today

00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,560
and like I said you see ten or fifteen a

00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:14,330
year on craigslist okay so now we got

00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,510
the machines little history about them

00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:21,830
now we got to get them to talk to linux

00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:24,050
so we have a current loop signal which

00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,910
goes from seventy five volts 20 and it's

00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,710
basically the current is always on and

00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:30,770
then it goes down for the data bits and

00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:33,440
then we want to get that the rs-232

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:36,770
which is 13 volts to 13 plus and minus

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,170
but the similar pattern but here we

00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:41,620
needed one stop bit up there we had to

00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:46,960
so there's a few other things we gotta

00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:49,180
so my first step was to get two hours

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,240
true 32 and I just took a passive device

00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:53,830
that takes current loop turns it into

00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:57,220
rs-232 and that was an off-the-shelf

00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,300
black box device and it cost about 270

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,670
I'll you can still buy them today you

00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:04,660
can get them for 50 to 70 bucks on ebay

00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:07,450
but now we're to an rs-232 value signal

00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,010
but we're at different baud rates and in

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,320
addition to that we have other issues

00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:13,870
such as the teletypes only upper case

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,760
why linux can take upper and lower case

00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,980
and that's just one thing you know I

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,990
need I need curly brackets to program in

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,570
Perl this teletype doesn't have curly

00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,890
brackets so I need a custom device to do

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,610
a little more work other than just

00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:29,710
switch the baud rate so it's got to

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:33,220
switch the baud rate it's got to convert

00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,990
uppercase to lowercase it's got a handle

00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,620
control C locally so when you hit

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:40,960
control C it flushes out the buffers

00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:43,059
needs to stop bits versus one I want to

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,929
convert a vertical bar which doesn't

00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:49,030
exist on the teletype to a one and then

00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:50,920
the auto force carriage return at the

00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,470
end of each line this teletype will keep

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,630
printing in the 80th or 72nd character

00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,860
if you don't have a carriage return in

00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,809
your file so you want to make sure you

00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,750
add carriage returns if there's a long

00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:03,429
piece of text coming out you want to

00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,410
have a variable time delay so when you

00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:07,090
get to the end of the carriage return

00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:09,340
you need you got to wait for that

00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:11,700
carried platinum to get back so you

00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,320
before you print the next character and

00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,690
then I wanted them to be able to enter

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,480
any ascii character i wasn't going to go

00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:21,010
unicode or anything like that but at

00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,110
least they could do every ascii

00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:25,150
character and then I built in a macro

00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:28,600
capabilities so they could do shortcuts

00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:32,380
so I paid this engineer to help me lay

00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,630
out the board he gave me a design and I

00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:41,320
wired it up on a breadboard it basically

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:43,210
uses atmel Arduino type chip then I kind

00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,850
of designed a functionality character

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,650
comes in it goes into translator goes

00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:50,080
into a ring buffer goes out to the TV

00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:52,960
teletype we're coming back the same way

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,700
and then I had a few escape sequences

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,080
with some shortcut memory and I have a

00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,850
cup

00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,500
local commands so I could like get

00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:03,330
information what's going on in the in

00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:05,340
this device so i first started well with

00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:07,769
arduino and it was really limited so i

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:10,620
switched over to at mels studio 6 a

00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:13,440
tremendous advancement over the arduino

00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:16,260
and it was all written in c++ and

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:23,159
assembly using interrupt subroutines and

00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:24,840
so forth and it's going to say some of

00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,059
the things that the software did is it

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,889
had a polling loop to do the cereal at

00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:33,870
the very low rate for these teletypes I

00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:35,820
just you know pulled an analog output

00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,950
signal that I turned high and low based

00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,019
on what my clock was doing and it's

00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,179
cycled about 50,000 times a second so

00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:45,059
that was plenty fast enough I built my

00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:46,590
own 16-bit precision clock I'm just

00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,529
using the features of the Admiral chip

00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:51,870
but I wrote my own precision clock and

00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:54,000
then i used the eeprom where's about 2k

00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:56,850
to do all the local storage so you can

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,740
actually program on the teletype or when

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,320
I tip w I want the weather when I hit

00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:04,230
and I want the news and it sends those

00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,840
commands to the Linux machine so then I

00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:09,029
got everything working or my prototype I

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,610
have these terminals simulating the

00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:13,370
teletypes it only takes about two

00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:15,840
seconds from when you press this

00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:19,230
download button here in the server I

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,970
mean in the atmel studio to go through

00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:23,389
that programmer and reprogram that ship

00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:26,100
it was a very fast iterative process I

00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:28,080
never got flow control working with the

00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:31,260
hardware not sure why but I ended up

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,600
going with Exxon X off which is a

00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:37,169
software form of flow control then I

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,880
needed a board so I laid everything out

00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:40,950
in the program called k cad which is

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,289
from France and it's a hard to learn

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,210
program but once you learn it its it's

00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:48,149
two keys you usually the same now is

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:50,130
really fast in fact even steven designed

00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:53,010
a board for his science-fair project

00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:55,799
using k cad and steve want you hand out

00:26:53,010 --> 00:27:00,090
the board that i did so they can see

00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:03,570
that was the first board I did and this

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:05,460
is showing the software here on one of

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,810
the nice things about the software is

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,880
that lets you see everything in 3d

00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:11,530
and you can rotate this board in 3d and

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,530
when I did this I actually found an air

00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:16,260
I noticed that there was a little gap

00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:20,140
between those two wires and sure enough

00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:22,300
the little via point it's called was not

00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:25,540
there and so I would have had open a

00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:27,340
break in my circuit so that was nice to

00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,990
find that so then I sent these off to

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,410
China for a hundred bucks I got ten

00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:35,080
boards and they came back and they were

00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:37,900
very good condition they looked quality

00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:41,170
looked great I put all the chips on and

00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:43,780
it didn't work so and this is my first

00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:46,330
project and I I had no clue you know

00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,830
okay try this voltage and the voltages

00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,740
were a little bit off but i eventually

00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:55,480
figured out in about two hours that this

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:57,190
device right here my regulator the leads

00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,100
were backwards so instead of one two

00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:02,500
three ahead three two one so it was not

00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,510
working too well so all I did was take

00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,750
that device and i mounted it upside down

00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:11,400
and put the heat sink on top of it and

00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:13,630
and it worked fine and it still you know

00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,580
helped with the heat so it was no issue

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:18,370
so it was a very minor problem and that

00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:21,790
was the only one I found then I put it

00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:24,040
in a box and you can see him down here

00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:26,230
as they work on the system so now I

00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,840
needed some linux system to talk to and

00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:33,580
I had this computer and it was just

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,680
available and I loaded centos OS 6.0 and

00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:41,020
there was nothing special was a straight

00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:43,600
install so that was easy now I needed

00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:47,860
some software so i wanted to get news

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,570
weather wiki so that the kids could just

00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,030
type in news or weather and it would go

00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,800
off the cloud and get that information

00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:59,260
so i'm going to show you a little a few

00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:01,900
things i did with that let's see if i

00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:04,480
can transition nice and now this was the

00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:07,240
weather program i wrote it all in perl

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,890
and here's a bunch of my test cases so

00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:13,690
like this will get the forecast for

00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:17,290
three days so if i run this it goes off

00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:20,800
to I think it's weather gov did I hit

00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:21,400
run yet yep and so there it went got the

00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,860
data

00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,660
and it prints out a little bit of this

00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:28,720
is local to our house so it's telling

00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,520
the information at our house and I just

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,190
formatted it for the teletype make sure

00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,500
no line is longer than 72 characters and

00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,930
so when you type weather here it's

00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:41,380
running this program so I did a couple

00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:45,340
others news this goes off and gret gets

00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:48,570
the Drudge Report so if we run that it

00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:50,890
goes off and reads the columns and

00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:53,680
prints them out so you see top of the

00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:55,990
heap and the main headline and what's

00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,870
going on and it prints it out all and a

00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:01,150
ski for you and then I did a Wikipedia

00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:04,660
and then we did a little doctor program

00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:09,360
that the kids can run it's a gentleman

00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:09,360
at MIT wrote this about 30 years ago and

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:18,510
so that was that was the scraping I did

00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:18,510
so now let's go back to here

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,200
so next I use mojolicious to do some of

00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:33,730
the scraping that was made it easy to

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,409
traverse Dom trees but next I wanted to

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:38,950
be able to program in Perl on these

00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:40,630
machines and I had to do that using a

00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,240
source filter because the teletype does

00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,769
not have any of these characters curly

00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,549
brackets it doesn't have a totally it

00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:50,440
doesn't have a vertical bar and you need

00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:53,799
those two really program in Perl they're

00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,570
pretty crucial so I mapped these to some

00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:58,330
other characters using a source filter

00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:00,789
and so this is the the beginning of the

00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:02,830
code is so if I type a bracket be

00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:07,360
bracket which the teletype can type it

00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:10,330
substitutes for a curly bracket and so

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,100
if here's the actual source filter it's

00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:15,700
there's really no magics right here it's

00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:19,389
mapping this to the character that I

00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:21,130
want and this is a program now written

00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:23,289
using this method so here's my Open

00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:29,440
bracket these are these are my close

00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:32,590
brackets and so when you run this

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,409
program it prints this out and so the

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:38,620
question is okay what was that well this

00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:41,350
told me what pins to break off on my

00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:44,260
here is here is wheel so if I followed

00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:45,789
that pattern then I could get and I

00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,950
can't tell you how many mistakes i would

00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:49,960
i would get the columns wrong or I get

00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,909
you break a pin off or two pins and

00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,139
these things we're going to have to 3d

00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:58,389
print them but you can't get them

00:31:53,139 --> 00:32:02,169
anymore okay so then I loaded some

00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:04,539
utilities standard utilities like ed bc

00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:08,320
for a calculator cows a kids enjoyed

00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:11,139
that time date calendar and then I put

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,789
an email on it with postfix and fetch

00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:15,100
mail and I have all that working so if

00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:16,809
you guys type in mail and your address

00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:20,230
you can actually send an email to your

00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:23,139
phone then I added some games I went got

00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:25,419
some old libraries and got Go Fish

00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:29,139
monopoly and I wrote the doctor program

00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:32,139
using a Sipan module so then I had all

00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:34,120
this working are running and I needed a

00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:35,720
manual for the kids so I wrote a manual

00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:41,240
and

00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:44,179
if we go here here it is online and so

00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,530
all these topics are here so if they

00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:47,570
want to know how to run the reverse

00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:52,100
command right there it shows them how to

00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:53,990
do that so there's a complete manual of

00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,700
everything how to set it up how to run

00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:59,510
it how it should be wired how to turn it

00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:01,809
on things to do for fun now let me go

00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,809
back to

00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm a little bit out of sequence here so

00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:22,680
let me here we go okay we're back so I

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,010
wrote a manual and now this was the

00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,480
first time I had everything working and

00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:31,080
I had quite a smile on my face yes

00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,720
Steven yes why don't you hand out one of

00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:38,400
the manuals if so that they could take a

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,990
look at that and this shows of the day I

00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,670
had it running for the first time it

00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,950
happened to be when the malaysian

00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:47,580
airline went down which is about a year

00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:51,630
ago and i had it set up so that when you

00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:54,030
log on you get a quote from Spock or one

00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,920
of the using the fortune utility then

00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:59,280
next I train the kids how to use the

00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:03,300
machines and here they are laughing at

00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:04,860
the doctor program and now basically

00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,660
that's it we're going to let you come up

00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,980
and try the machine soon soon but I want

00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,480
to talk a little bit about teletype

00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,200
corporation give you a little bit of a

00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,940
history and what that company was like

00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:17,370
first of all Howard teletypes used in

00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,100
the old days they were used over phone

00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:23,630
lines to send telegrams before that just

00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:26,130
to send you know telegraphic messages

00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:28,710
they were used in the military heavily

00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:30,179
during World War two the radio signals

00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,770
were sent encrypted and then they were

00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:36,000
decrypted and then they were printed on

00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:37,620
teletypes and in business you know this

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,520
is some of their advertising which was

00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:42,810
about the period of these SR 33s they

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,290
said they could use it basically in

00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:49,590
anything this was an interesting machine

00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:51,500
this is a wall-mounted teletype and we

00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:53,880
actually have one of these at home and

00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,860
we're planning on installing it in the

00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,630
kitchen so that when I come down in the

00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,310
morning it's got the weather it's got

00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:01,380
the news and it has how much money I've

00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:05,400
made on my few sites that earn a little

00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:07,920
bit of money I just rip off the paper

00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,620
and I'm informed so a little bit about

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,240
the company they made almost every

00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,670
product that went into these machines

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,220
they did not outsource hardly anything

00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:19,140
so the here either you see a guy who all

00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,960
he's doing is bringing in raw materials

00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:23,430
sheets of steel sheets of copper sheets

00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,369
of whatever they were used

00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:30,510
and almost everything was nickel-plated

00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:33,230
so that it will last almost forever they

00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:35,160
also had tons of engineers this was like

00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,599
1967 they had about five hundred

00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,700
engineers and they would have a whole

00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,960
week which was called engineers week and

00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,270
they would bring in people talk about

00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,630
engineering topics and try to get cross

00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:47,910
fertilization in the various departments

00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:50,339
they also had an awards program and this

00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:54,450
is a 1967 and the gentleman the center

00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:57,230
here he got an award 555 dollars and

00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:59,819
that in today's dollars is 11,000 bucks

00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:02,250
so these were significant awards and

00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:04,050
they did this every month to all the

00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,780
suggestions that were sent in by the

00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:09,210
employees there's an interesting thing

00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,089
this is actually a scheduling mechanism

00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:13,589
for their computer system to decide

00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:15,000
who's going to use the printer for

00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:16,319
payroll who's going to use the printer

00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,059
for accounting who's going to use the

00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:20,339
printer for this and all this does is

00:36:18,059 --> 00:36:22,530
these little bars are like who's going

00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:24,780
to use a computer time when I thought

00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:27,210
that was interesting I love his title

00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:32,240
it's a computer peripheral Operations

00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:34,230
Section Chief they had a family day

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,000
where they would bring in all the

00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:39,420
employees on all the employees families

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,220
to see what they do at the company they

00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,650
had many clubs I mean look at all these

00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:51,059
clubs photography chess hobby radio

00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:52,859
badminton dancing boy scouts then they

00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:54,299
had a hobby show each year where all the

00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:57,119
employees would come in and show their

00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:58,920
hobbies and now this one I didn't know

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,250
what this was and someone told me graph

00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:05,940
analysis is handwriting analysis or yeah

00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:08,730
handwriting analysis this is another

00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:11,490
picture and isn't for another award los

00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:14,460
alamos cards again i would like to some

00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:19,559
guesses on what this picture is that's

00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:25,170
not the vice goes shooting club hole

00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:26,880
punching marksmanship well it is a

00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:30,180
shooting club so let's give this

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:36,260
gentleman the gentleman in the white

00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:36,260
shirt there this actually happens to be

00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:43,480
see if I get this to work the illinoise

00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,490
Bell rifle team and this gentleman right

00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,410
here helped me a lot on this product

00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:49,240
this is a Don and he used to repair

00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:51,760
these machines and I got some advice and

00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:55,450
parts from him but they used to compete

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,730
with the teletype gun club in fact

00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:02,890
teletype had multiple gun clubs they had

00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:04,630
this is the it says I think small board

00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:07,390
but they had different types of weapons

00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:08,680
different clubs for each of those but

00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:12,150
it's very different from today I mean

00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:16,090
how many your companies have gun clubs

00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:18,610
they also had an evening school and this

00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:21,700
is from their art class and this is some

00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:24,130
artwork done by the employees and in

00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:27,070
addition to art they had all these

00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:29,080
different topics a beginning Russian I

00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:35,230
thought was interesting they had screw

00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:37,870
machine theory screw machine theory

00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,370
right and they had heathkit which I

00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:41,620
thought that's that that's dead and gone

00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:50,560
they had cartoon which is interesting

00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:53,470
and modern math slide rule 2 they also

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,840
had a choral group that sang concerts

00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:58,210
and here they're playing for a hospital

00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,410
and their next concert was going to be

00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,930
at the tool and die institute

00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:03,340
graduations sharing ceremonies and they

00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,250
practice in the cafeteria every

00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:08,920
wednesday if you wanted to go hear him

00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:11,050
they also had an annual picnic and this

00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,580
was quite legend for their company these

00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:14,260
were this was a big event a lot of

00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:17,050
people talked a lot about those picnics

00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,550
and this was their headquarters this was

00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:23,050
the main building it was built in about

00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:27,070
nineteen sixty and it was just outside

00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:29,320
of Chicago and just give you a little

00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:32,280
perspective this is ATT who eventually

00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:34,810
owned teletype they were bought by

00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,970
western union which was a big telegraph

00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:38,980
company no Western Electric sorry I got

00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:40,870
that wrong Western Electric and then

00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:46,390
Western Electric was owned by eighteen t

00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:48,100
so you can see here eight teletype this

00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,290
is all the bell companies like Illinois

00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,380
Bell New York Bell

00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:56,000
and then 80 this is teletype this little

00:39:52,380 --> 00:40:00,360
bit and it was about 1% of all of AT&T

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,060
and it was shut down by 18 T in about

00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:05,430
nineteen ninety and this is the

00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:11,040
headquarters building being torn down to

00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:13,020
make way for a new shopping center so

00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,420
that's the end of the presentation a

00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:19,620
little bit of contact for me this is my

00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:21,870
contact number so just remember 77-point

00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:25,140
04 and you might ask well how do I use

00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:27,570
that will you add that to pie and it

00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:30,600
turns out you get that number and the

00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:32,430
first sets of digits there is my cell

00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:37,350
phone number so you just got to remember

00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:39,990
77 point 0 4 plus pi then my emails

00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:42,510
there and also information on the whole

00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:47,250
restoration project is on the website

00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:49,830
there that address so the last award for

00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:51,180
the best question before we go to the

00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:53,310
demo where you can come up and try these

00:40:51,180 --> 00:41:03,210
machines do you guys have any questions

00:40:53,310 --> 00:41:05,370
that you want to ask yes I've just

00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,900
always been impressed by the mechanical

00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:08,640
ingenuity that's gone into these

00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,680
machines and it's a real challenge I

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,410
mean it's a lot better than watching TV

00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,580
and it's something where you're done

00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:16,470
with the process you have something you

00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,970
can actually use you know I hope to have

00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:22,230
it in my kitchen telling me the news

00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:23,790
each morning but it's just a fun fun

00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:30,480
project where you have a goal at the end

00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:32,910
yes not yet but it's a wall mount unit

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:39,780
so it's going to be fairly small and we

00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:41,640
we have the perfect wall for it yes do

00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:45,810
they have a twitter account no no but

00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:48,390
they are connected what's that yes

00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:50,190
that's true you could send email to the

00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,750
address that you get from here and it

00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:58,040
would come in here so this has to weigh

00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:58,040
email any other questions yes yeah

00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:08,070
um not really there's not much going on

00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:13,320
in Utah but there's one other gentleman

00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:14,580
here who collects tektronix machines but

00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,530
he and I are probably the only two guys

00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,960
in the state who have let's say

00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:20,280
extensive pieces of equipment but

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,790
they're in the US there's about a

00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:26,310
hundred people who do restoration of

00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:28,380
these machines and we trade them back

00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:31,980
and forth and you know help each other

00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:38,070
out and it's actually a lot of fun any

00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:40,740
other questions yes they're quite

00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:43,530
reliable but they're not designed to be

00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:45,930
perfect they even tolerate I think one

00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:49,650
air out of every ten thousand bits or

00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:51,450
bytes so they do expect airs and it's a

00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:54,030
it's a tolerance type thing they can get

00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:56,010
out of tolerance but they're pretty

00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:58,620
reliable these are actually designed to

00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:00,570
be throwaway machines this particular

00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,760
model but it end up being so popular

00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:04,260
that they they kept reinforcing it and

00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,970
reinforcing it and fixing bits and

00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,250
pieces that turned out to be a problem

00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,900
but they're pretty reliable and they're

00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:13,050
pretty easy to restore because their

00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:15,270
number one filled with oil and oil means

00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:18,330
if it's providing has not been in a barn

00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:20,250
with cats and rats and birds and mice

00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:22,980
then it's usually in pretty good shape

00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:29,760
and it's easy to restore any other

00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:31,200
questions yes nobody makes parts for

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,740
these but you can get all the

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,360
consumables the paper or the paper tape

00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:40,710
there's plenty of paper tape around the

00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:46,590
ribbons and and just most of these parts

00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:48,540
are pretty simple yes well that's

00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:50,160
another long story but there there was a

00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,450
guy there who collect amazing stuff

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,360
while we went through his at warehouse

00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:56,370
and got a bunch of stuff and we ended up

00:43:54,360 --> 00:44:00,680
with a bunch of stuff from Los Alamos

00:43:56,370 --> 00:44:00,680
National Labs yes

00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:23,599
oh we use ed so gotta use ed line editor

00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:28,760
any other questions yes the oiling and

00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:32,210
then what well it took about six months

00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,650
to restore each machine it's just you

00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:35,240
know a lot of a few hours here if you

00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:37,190
are is there may be a couple weekends so

00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,480
it's a it really depends on how much

00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:41,119
time you had if you had a month you

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,770
could do it in a month easily and the

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,619
other good thing is it's so well

00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:47,300
documented that even with no help from

00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:48,830
anyone outside you could probably figure

00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,570
almost everything out from the manuals

00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,190
because they were designed for field

00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:54,530
technicians to go in and do all this

00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:56,180
work and everything's very modular with

00:44:54,530 --> 00:45:11,950
just a couple screws almost everything

00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:14,420
comes out of there yes yeah i don't i

00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:22,609
don't think i'm going to go there that

00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:26,180
far any other question yes well i don't

00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:29,300
know what you mean by best response the

00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:31,339
room here has been good but but it's

00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:33,230
it's it's fun to see this old technology

00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:34,760
still work and you know we will still be

00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,500
using these things a hundred years from

00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,200
now because we're still going to be

00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,700
reading and writing text and you know

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,099
people aren't going to be reading and

00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:45,380
writing images so unless that changes

00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:47,000
that these machines will still be fun to

00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:51,080
play with for many many many years to

00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,230
come any other questions okay with that

00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,640
we're going to move to the the demo and

00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:58,130
where you can come down here's a couple

00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:00,410
rules be gentle with the machines you

00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:05,660
can come up here and use them don't type

00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:07,950
two keys at one time and ask before you

00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:09,660
push an unknown button

00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:12,420
if you don't know what the buttons going

00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,160
to do and no malicious shell commands to

00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:19,140
take over the system or create a kernel

00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:22,260
panic so and to send an email message

00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:24,119
all you got to do is type mail and your

00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,250
address and you it'll ask you for the

00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:29,359
subject in a single period will end the

00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:36,359
message and it'll show up on your iPhone

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:40,470
yes Stephen let's hand out the card to

00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:43,950
the best question who had you did no I

00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:46,140
don't think you did the best let's give

00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:52,800
it to the gentleman there or the suit

00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:56,089
jacket on okay thank you very much and

00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,089
that's the end of the presentation

00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:09,830
