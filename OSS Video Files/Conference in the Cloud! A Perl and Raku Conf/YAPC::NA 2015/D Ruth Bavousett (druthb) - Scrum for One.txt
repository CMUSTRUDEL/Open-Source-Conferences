you

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,019

your stick is the wave so I'm very glad

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:50,900

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,900
so get ready are you ready do it

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,690
yes

we still got a couple of minutes so

00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:07,870
there will be some stragglers coming in

00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:09,520
so relax and enjoy please be welcome if

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,740
you folks in the back are having trouble

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,349
seeing the smallest text here the second

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,120
line feel free to move forward I'd avoid

00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:19,330
this table you'll have trouble seeing me

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,900
if you sit at this table she says if

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,159
somebody sits down at that table he he

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:31,810
would want to see he just wants to

00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:38,259
listen see that's alright because I will

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:39,550
not be standing up yeah if you get

00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,099
around to this side of the table you

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,800
might be alright but you picked one of

00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:51,759
two seats that are just really hard boy

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:55,180
over there in the corner there yep good

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:59,740
morning rainy all right are you awake

00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:04,020

good morning Weldon how are you good

00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:21,910
good good well the energy level the room

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:25,840
picked up a couple of notches thanks to

00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:28,690
Russell I love that I think that's

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,100
awesome month you know we need two more

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,419
of him so they can do it in the other

00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,310
rooms because I'm sure in the other

00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:35,949
rooms they're like snoring and stuff cuz

00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,760
they don't have Russell to energize them

00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:38,760
first thing in the morning

00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,780
are we ready to start back there in the

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,940
back the sound of video we're good to go

00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:16,350
we're online and ready to go great

00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:18,780
thanks good morning thank you now and

00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:21,150
thank you russell for charging us up

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,010
that was that helped the energy level in

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,480
the room picked up just a little bit we

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,910
still have a few people that are kind of

00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,830
they look a little little weary there

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,070
but keep keep drinking that coffee it'll

00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:36,599
good for you i'm ruth babba set and i

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:40,650
work for cpanel i'm delighted to get

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,719
this opportunity I we do scrum at cpanel

00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,580
our product development teams use scrum

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,880
we've done it for a couple of years now

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:50,160
and it goes really well it works for us

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,750
most of the time as squirm is supposed

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,310
to and you iteratively learn how to make

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:58,320
it work better and so today I'm going to

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,810
be talking about how you can take some

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,690
of the lessons from scrum and apply them

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,160
outside of your team work some of us

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,810
have pet projects things that we're

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,070
working on on our own I have one I

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,950
talked about it the other day of my

00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:13,610
lightning talk some of us have really

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:16,170
chaotic lives outside of our work and

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,630
want that magic bullet to help us get

00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:24,350
organized so let's let's talk about kind

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:27,180
of why you're here you have you have

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,800
projects in your work that aren't suited

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,800
to scrum for some reason or another

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,180
we'll talk about some of those reasons

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,670
you're the sole practitioner your life's

00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:40,580
a mess and you maybe you've said for

00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:43,020
years someday when I'm organized uh-huh

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,700
let me tell you there is no magic bullet

00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,610
there's nobody external that's going to

00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,589
organize you now you can hire an

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,020
organization consultant and someone who

00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,300
will help you someone who knows more

00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,589
about it but there is no magic bullet

00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,510
for organization it's got to come from

00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:01,230
within you I'm here to give you some

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,790
tools maybe you think scrum is really

00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,110
smart you use it at work and you think

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,850
it's a really intelligent way of doing

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,339
things and you want to try to apply it

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,130
to other bits of your life well that's

00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,530
fine you're here too maybe you're really

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,670
hungover from last night and you want

00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,650
something that doesn't have anything to

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,310
do with code at nine o'clock in the

00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,890
morning

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:23,010
I'm okay with that that's that's good

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,480
I'm good with that so our goals will

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,980
spend a little time learning about scrum

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,910
now how many of you use scrum where

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,860
you're working now cpanel people okay

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,180
and a few others it's what I thought

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,220
that's a good thing now when I when I

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,200
gave this thing at cpanel of course all

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,790
the hands are up you know all right well

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,910
the next 15 minutes are going to be

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,790
boring for you so if you're using scrubs

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:47,790
some of this is going to be review of

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:49,529
your classes on scrum so be patient

00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,420
because there's plenty people in the

00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:52,890
room who don't know this stuff we're

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,560
going to see how that core philosophy

00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:57,510
will help in non team or non development

00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,180
sorts of projects we'll look at some of

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,220
the core thought around scrum and how it

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,290
can help the rest of your life some

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,839
things though scrum just doesn't work

00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,870
and we're going to explore what makes

00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:13,400
something that scrum won't work for and

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:16,380
what you can do as an alternative and

00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,790
I'll demonstrate my current tool the

00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,610
tool I'm using right now and just kind

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,530
of show you around a little bit how I

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,470
have both scrum e and nonce crummy

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:28,380
things in the same repository and the

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:32,910
same pile of work and and that helps me

00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:34,950
coordinate all of those things ok agile

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:38,940
programming when I started development

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:42,390
work in the in the early 1990s we had no

00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,490
organized methodology of how to work now

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,020
we knew how to code and I grew up

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,660
learning structured programming my first

00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:52,290
language in college was pascal which if

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:55,650
nothing else has structure but we didn't

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,330
learn how to work together the first

00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,820
project where i had to work with another

00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:02,370
developer was my final semester in

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,020
college and went all the way through

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,980
college working as a sole practitioner

00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:10,800
and we didn't have any kind of organized

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:13,860
methodology for how to do things as a

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,570
group now as you can imagine this this

00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,190
resulted in a lot of bad code now

00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,810
sometimes you were on a large team you

00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,900
were working on a big project and you

00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:23,610
had peers who if your relationship with

00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,320
that person was good enough you could

00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,580
take code to them and say well then

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,300
would you look at my code real quick I

00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,610
yeah you know just check it over but you

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,220
might

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:36,399
not have that even if you were on a big

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:39,970
team so the result was a lot of really

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,610
stinky code a lot of really shady code

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:45,250
especially stuff hard to modify once

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:49,180
that person leaves the organization once

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:51,310
its authors gone that code is on its

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,959
last legs as soon as it breaks nobody

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,690
can fix it we build it over we start

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,310
from scratch and that happened a lot an

00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,810
organization i was with there was a man

00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:02,470
who'd been there writing cobol disco

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:06,250
ball plays for about 20 years and he had

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:08,320
a heart attack and died at 55 and it

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:12,160
took them six months to recover some of

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,730
the functionality that he had maintained

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,500
because once his stuff started breaking

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:20,410
you know because of upgrades of

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:23,800
libraries and other packages they had to

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,450
rebuild it all okay so a few a few

00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,790
developers around the turn of the 21st

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,160
century started thinking about that and

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,290
they thought about agility and how do we

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,750
develop in a way that's iterative and

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:37,029
that shares that information base across

00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,730
more developers so that you don't have

00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:41,740
those kinds of problems and they took a

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,860
list of things and all of these values

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,709
are valuable and they say that we value

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:50,680
the things on the left more than we

00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:52,300
value the things on the right that's not

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,920
to say that the things on the right are

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,410
not important and not valuable they

00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,029
absolutely are but we value the things

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:03,100
on the left more fair enough and they

00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:05,500
develop this thought of how do we just

00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:09,550
work in a circle let's plan let's work

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,230
let's show it off get feedback use that

00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,630
to inform the next round of planning and

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,690
the idea was the smaller you make this

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,519
circle in time the more agile you are

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:24,699
the more capable you are of coping with

00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:27,399
change as you go and thus began scrum

00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:30,190
out of that agile manifesto out of that

00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:32,640
agile thought came scrum and the three

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,800
pillars of scrum our transparency

00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,390
inspection and adaptation transparency

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,740
all your work is out there visible so

00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:42,660
other people can see what you're up to

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:44,170
you as an individual and you as a team

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,570
inspection you as

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,480
team are inspecting not only what you

00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:52,540
worked on but how you worked on it every

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,040
time around that circle you have a scrum

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,779
retrospective where you take a look and

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,860
spend time talking about how we work to

00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:02,260
the sprint not just the code we wrote

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,690
but how that meeting went and how well

00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:10,360
did we plan all of those functions and

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:13,660
then adapt adaptation we change based on

00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,209
those results okay now everybody at

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,320
cpanel is a certified scrummaster

00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:18,519
everybody who's been on any of the scrum

00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,230
teams that's one of the things that

00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:22,510
we've done we've all taken the certified

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,670
scrum master course and and you spend

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:28,779
two days so i'm going to show you in two

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:31,690
minutes or so what cpanel people spend

00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:33,790
two days learning okay so on the left

00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,620
side these two piles of cards the orange

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,089
cards and the green cards there those

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,930
are user stories and i'll talk more

00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:46,029
about those in a minute but they are

00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:49,000
small chunks of work that are designed

00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:52,660
to be finished during the Sprint period

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,579
of two to four weeks you chunk it down

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,949
until you say okay the team can do this

00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:58,420
in two weeks that's a small enough story

00:15:56,949 --> 00:16:01,860
if it's too big for that gum chop it up

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:04,420
or expect that it's going to last

00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,100
through multiple cycles and that's kind

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,829
of okay but it's not strictly scrubbed

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,899
the the team has a product owner and the

00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:23,709
product owner is the one whose wrist

00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:27,040
whoops we lost our link excuse me okay

00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:29,620
are we back we're back good the product

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,949
owner is the person who's responsible to

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:36,130
the outside world the stakeholders the

00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:37,690
boss the users and they're our

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,980
responsibility is to communicate with

00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:44,230
those people and design these stories so

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,449
that the work in the end will meet the

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:48,220
needs of those stakeholders you have a

00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:51,160
scrum master whose job it is to enforce

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,949
the process and they also take care of

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,420
logistical needs of the team hey we need

00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:56,860
to have a meeting so we can have a hack

00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,230
session on this and this and this I

00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,850
don't have to arraign

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,090
that meeting room my scrum master does

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,490
that I just tell him and all i gotta do

00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:09,240
is yell impediment and my scrum master

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,800
will jump one of my teammates and and

00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,020
i'm going to try to crack creak us up

00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,750
here in a minute and it's might work one

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:19,470
of my teammates in a daily meeting said

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,850
there is an impediment and our our scrum

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,710
master perked up and he said what's the

00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:27,210
impediment there are no more animal

00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:30,030
crackers in the vending machine got him

00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:32,310
the scrum master went to the store and

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:36,110
bought one of those ginormous barrels of

00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:39,260
animal crackers and brought it to him

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:42,990
impediment removers that's what they do

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:44,670
the team spends a little bit of time at

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,870
the first of the sprint planning what

00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:48,030
work they're going to do they choose

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,050
from the product backlog the stories

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,540
that they're going to work on that

00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:54,600
sprint and they set them aside called

00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:56,790
the Sprint backlog and then they spend

00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,500
time working on that every day there's a

00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,170
chance to meet and catch up with each

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,510
other and see if we have problems that

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,880
we can help each other with and let each

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,860
other know about progress that's the

00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,910
daily meeting and those usually last a

00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:13,680
few minutes ours last about 15 minutes

00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,210
at the end of that time you demonstrate

00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,980
it you show it off for the product owner

00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:21,510
and other stakeholders what you've done

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:25,200
those pieces that you've finished and

00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,880
you get feedback on them you do a

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,580
retrospective meeting where you see how

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:34,080
did we work did it work well what can we

00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:36,840
do better in my team we rewrite on on

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:42,840
index cards and you title them good bad

00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:45,780
and ugly and and sometimes you know

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,940
useful stuff comes out of there and

00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,190
sometimes have you ever seen those

00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,100
congressional resolutions that are it is

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,650
the sense of the Congress that a lot of

00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,510
the cards come to come to be those you

00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,490
know it is the sense of the team that

00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:05,370
our product owner has been invisible too

00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:07,110
much that informs the process and it's

00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,020
okay to say those things and it's okay

00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,400
to talk about that kind of thing and

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,150
that's that's what the retrospective is

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,090
for and then that

00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,830
forms the planning the same day or the

00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,500
following day you turn around do it

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:23,990
again start over two-week iterations at

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:27,000
cpanel okay clear as mud with me so far

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:28,650
talk about those user stories as a

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,850
person I would like things so their

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:34,380
accomplishment as a user of the system I

00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,360
would like it to make me a stronger

00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:41,010
passwords so that my account will be

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:44,670
more secure this makes sense right you

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,170
with me here is everybody awake I'm

00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:52,440
checking in the back there I'm watching

00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:56,100
you yep you wait good good good yeah now

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,170
the same story the same purpose could be

00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,820
expressed a different way as the system

00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,670
administrator I would like to protect my

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:06,690
users from hacking so I'm going to make

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:11,310
the system require stronger passwords so

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:12,660
that their accounts cannot be hacked you

00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,510
express it a little different way and

00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:20,210
that can in some cases change the scope

00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:26,570
of the work so you want to think about

00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:28,980
who is person and what is accomplishment

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,870
what's the purpose of this story that's

00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:34,440
the accomplishment so there's an example

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:36,420
of it one of the things that the team

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,700
must do and the product owner leads this

00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,920
work is grooming the backlog taking

00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,990
those stories in that leftmost pile and

00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,940
making sure that they're properly worded

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,590
stories that they really are user

00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,030
stories that can be accomplished in a

00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,320
unit of work in two weeks three weeks

00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,960
four weeks whatever your sprint length

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,800
is they can enumerate the acceptance

00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,180
criteria what is done if you if you hang

00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:03,450
around scrum people much you'll hear

00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:07,730
done ness I want to see the doneness of

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,730
this task when do we know we're done

00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:14,100
discussion and an enumeration of tasks

00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,740
can happen during the backlog grooming

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,870
that's when you kind of decide your your

00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,730
overall plan for actually implementing

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,860
it you'll notice in this story here at

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,920
the bottom of the screen no where do I

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:31,470
say how I'm going to do that

00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:33,300
no where it shouldn't be there that's

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,530
for grooming the backlog the tasks that

00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,210
you're actually going to do or part of

00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:39,150
that story and there could be one or

00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:41,160
more tasks okay and then you prioritize

00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,740
them against other stories based on

00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,300
their value in the grand scheme of

00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,280
things and that's the product owners

00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,140
primary purview is to know that grand

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,910
scheme of things and know what those

00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,830
priorities are and prioritize stories

00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,020
accordingly that didn't mean the team

00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,130
has to work on them in that order it's

00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,350
the team that decides what they're going

00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,940
to work on that's another key element of

00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,100
scrum is that the team decides what

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,370
they're going to do from this backlog

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:07,110
and if one of the stories and we've had

00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:10,290
this happen one of the stories is really

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:12,570
murky we can't decide on this story how

00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,860
we're going to implement it we can

00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,140
refuse to take it and leave it on the

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:19,350
backlog with a note to the product owner

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,720
this needs clarification we can't work

00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:24,960
on this until we know what done looks

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,990
like we can give that feedback to the

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,700
product owner okay so let's talk about

00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:32,000
scrum and personal projects you saw this

00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,250
image a little bit ago the three pillars

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,800
transparency by by getting these things

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:41,520
out of your head and writing them down

00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,250
somewhere you're practicing transparency

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,980
you're getting it out there so you can

00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:48,900
kind of work on it independently of the

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,730
the thoughts that you have going in your

00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:54,150
head the multitasking that we all kind

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,890
of do an inspection you're taking a

00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:59,190
chance to look at how you've done

00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:01,530
recently how do you feel about how

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:04,530
accomplished you've been do you feel

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:06,360
like you got a lot done last week you

00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:08,070
can ask those kinds of questions through

00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,230
the introspection process and then

00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:13,470
adaptation gives you a chance to figure

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:17,550
out ways to do it better for the next

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:22,590
little bit of time maybe a week maybe

00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:24,600
two so here's an example use a story as

00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:27,150
a seat in the CPI modular maricon I'd

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,830
like to add non ISO date handlers so

00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:31,260
that Americans using it won't lose their

00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:35,220
minds and complain about it can you hear

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:38,100
mount trout saying that thank you now

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,510
the problem with this story is its scope

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,700
is weird

00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:44,400
because most coders know about iso dates

00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:47,220
anyway right now if the module is user

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,910
end user facing the value of this goes

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:54,480
up some darn it but so this story is a

00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:56,550
little shady because it's doing

00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,230
something that has very low value if

00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:04,110
it's a coder facing story why would you

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:05,670
add a non ISO date handler to a module

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,380
when you know about iso dates and you

00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,860
already have converters to switch back

00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,240
and forth thanks to Dave roll ski right

00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,680
here's another non-development example

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,570
is a person who uses our wood burning

00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,520
fireplace I would like a shelter over

00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:19,230
the firewood pile so that it doesn't get

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,230
wet and make the fireplace unusable for

00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:26,910
want of dry firewood the goal here is

00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:30,390
clear the value is high you want to stay

00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:32,580
warm at night nowhere in there is

00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:39,930
implementation detail how am I going to

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:42,300
do that I'd like a shelter over it I

00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,830
might move it into my garage I might

00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,740
move it onto a porch or I might

00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,720
construct something and it still meets

00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:53,040
the criteria of the story but

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,350
implementation details not here thank

00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,150
you but you're close you were your kind

00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:00,390
of reaching at it and yeah I want to

00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,860
cover the pile I could throw a tarp over

00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,310
it and that would meet the requirements

00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:08,820
of the story except to throw in a tarp

00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:12,120
over it's a bad idea because then once

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:17,100
moisture gets under there but the value

00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:21,330
is clear the value is high story is

00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:23,100
obvious as the driver of my car I'd like

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,390
to get the tires rotated so that I don't

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,200
wear the mounts so quickly and my

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:31,590
driving is safer this is a good idea but

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,540
the value is kind of personal now in the

00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:36,060
sense that if your tires let go of the

00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,980
roadway you endanger other drivers there

00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,960
is value to other drivers in you getting

00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,170
your tires rotated but that's kind of

00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,610
most people don't think that way on

00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:48,540
their face they say I don't want to

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:50,820
crash my car the value is high but it's

00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,070
kind of personal here again we have a

00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:57,950
story that is

00:25:53,070 --> 00:26:01,980
maybe not the best because of its

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:04,250
personal value so here's some crafting

00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:07,350
tips how do you write these user stories

00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:09,450
well I showed you the formula as a

00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:13,289
person I would like thing so that

00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:17,549
accomplishment clearly enumerate the

00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:19,649
value what is the win here who wins when

00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:21,630
you do whatever it is the story is

00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:25,620
calling for you to do who's the winner

00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:32,490
and why try to take yourself out of the

00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:34,950
equation my product owners name at work

00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:41,909
is Ken and we actually have stories as

00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:43,710
can I would like this is a problematic

00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:46,139
story on its face and I haven't even

00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,870
told you the rest of the story yet right

00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:52,019
because the value is personal he hasn't

00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:54,450
expressed that value as our customers as

00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:57,360
cpanel customers as our license holders

00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,549
as their customers the end users of Z

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,740
panel the value needs to be expressed

00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:04,259
outside yourself if at all possible if

00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:07,289
the value is totally your own will kick

00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:09,899
that into the other system but express

00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:13,409
the value without you in it as best you

00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:15,059
can and don't specify your

00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:16,740
implementation details to very much

00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:19,620
unless you've already settled on that

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,419
but that really belongs in tasking it

00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,620
out when you start setting up your tasks

00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:27,149
that's when you talk about

00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:28,950
implementation details there are some

00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:34,320
things where scrum just isn't the right

00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:36,200
idea you're on the wrong track if the

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,740
process is going to take longer than

00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,419
this the story execution don't write a

00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,789
story don't rather use a story for

00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:47,370
taking out the trash please don't do

00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:50,009
that I'm not I'm telling you don't do it

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,480
it's a good exercise really but there

00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:53,460
are better exercises spend your time

00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,980
better you all are smart people get paid

00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,149
good money don't don't think up a story

00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,950
for youth taking out the trash just take

00:27:57,149 --> 00:28:03,860
out the trash as a resident of my home I

00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:05,879
would like there to not be cockroaches

00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,179
therefore I would like the trash to be

00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:10,409
taken out

00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:12,840
make sure you don't have a stakeholder

00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:15,480
outside yourself if there is no

00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,669
stakeholder besides you if no one wins

00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:21,210
but you it's probably not a good idea

00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:23,070
for scrum if you can't express that

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,200
value in terms of some other human being

00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:29,580
even if they're also a resident of your

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:33,120
house that's okay so you know as my

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:37,710
partner I would like as my child I would

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,820
like that's ok as me as me I would like

00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,200
to play this video game to its

00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,899
conclusion so that I can feel very

00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:46,950
satisfied about having one that's a

00:28:42,899 --> 00:28:48,899
shady story that's just oh really if the

00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:51,240
story cannot be subdivided into atomic

00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:53,669
tasks that can be completed separate

00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:58,200
from each other it's a really bad story

00:28:53,669 --> 00:29:00,389
for scrum an example of this is rotating

00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,679
the tires now if you're going to take it

00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:03,570
to the shop and have somebody else

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,419
rotate your tires there are several

00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:08,850
atomic tasks there call your garage and

00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:11,429
make an appointment and arrange somebody

00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:14,249
to pick you up or for the garage to take

00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:15,869
you back to work drive over there come

00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:17,940
back and pick it up and pay for it

00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:19,980
there's several tasks there and their

00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:23,340
atomic because in between them you can

00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,350
go do other things right if you're going

00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,999
to rotate the tires on your car it's an

00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,559
atomic test because once you have the

00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:32,389
car up on blocks in the wheels off you

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,769
can't go do something else very easily

00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:38,309
it doesn't make sense to it makes sense

00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:40,080
to keep working so it's it's not

00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:42,029
subdivide abul if you're going to do it

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,249
yourself and that's one of those where

00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:45,629
scrums kind of a bad idea or routine

00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:48,509
chores taking out the trash like you

00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:51,149
know how to do that you don't need to

00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:55,350
think about the implementation details

00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:56,610
very much doing your laundry you know

00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,080
how to do that you put it in the machine

00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,340
you put soap in the machine you hit the

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,559
button you go away and do something else

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,700
for a while you come back right we know

00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,289
how to do those things so the

00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,289
implementation details of those routine

00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:09,210
chores don't make for good scrum again

00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:11,639
if you really want to do the exercise do

00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:13,139
the exercise but no you're going to give

00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:17,279
up on that real quick because it's a lot

00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:19,679
of time so if not scrum what do you do

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,640
you still need organization you're still

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,320
waiting lots of you

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,580
you for that magic bullet we raised our

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,160
hands at the beginning you're waiting

00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:30,620
for that solution to organize you well

00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:33,240
most planning systems work from top down

00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:35,400
if you go and look at franklin covey or

00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:40,680
some of the others you'll see think

00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:45,920
about your life's vision is it just me

00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,920
is that hard what is your life's purpose

00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:52,290
now some people have figured that out

00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:55,740
but as technical people in particular as

00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:58,860
a group I find that we find that very

00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:02,610
hard to do because we have a lot of day

00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:06,050
to day tasks that are not 30,000 foot

00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:08,220
view their runway level the day-to-day

00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:11,700
organization of all the crap I need to

00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,680
get done none of which fits into what I

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,000
want to be doing 15 years from now it's

00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,830
just stuff that needs to be done

00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,210
rotating the tires and taking out the

00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:20,130
trash and doing laundry and feeding the

00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:26,160
kids and all the things that we do day

00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:28,290
to day gets overwhelming those of you

00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,050
who saw this when I did it at cpanel new

00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,340
section right here as a person who

00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,080
struggled with depression there are

00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,890
times where even those most routine

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,060
tasks need to be reminded those of you

00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:41,310
who have struggled with depression know

00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:43,380
this you have to remember be reminded to

00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:48,990
take your pills at night right been

00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:50,960
there okay it happens and so an

00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:54,150
organization system that can handle

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:58,080
whatever depth of routine you need it to

00:31:54,150 --> 00:32:02,100
as your life changes and adjusts and

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:06,990
moves and grows would be useful right

00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:09,390
whether it uses scrum or not but most of

00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,860
us need a runway level view for a lot of

00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:12,570
things even if you're not wrestling with

00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,800
depression you need a runway level view

00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,540
for all the stuff you need to remember

00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,070
to do I need to I need to be sure and

00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,960
call Russell and remind him to be at my

00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:25,830
presentation so that you can do the do

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:27,090
the wave and I'm wired up about

00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:29,160
presenting and so I'm not going to

00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:32,720
remember to call him and just hope he

00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,720
shows up sure enough he did

00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:44,410
do you know this guy cpanel people no

00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:46,960
fair uh-huh fail David Allen yes does

00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:48,310
this help this is david allen 2002

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,310
getting things done he came out with

00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:54,880
this book and it specifically addresses

00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:57,970
the runway level problem he says so many

00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,490
organization systems take this 30,000

00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:02,050
foot view and what is your life vision

00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:05,290
and what's your life goal he said that

00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:07,240
craps hard to do that's hard to do for a

00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:10,360
lot of people especially technical

00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,610
people it's hard to do that and so he

00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,930
gives us a runway level method for

00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:16,090
organizing the things that are happening

00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:19,450
right clothes in the things you need to

00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:21,760
do today to give you time to think more

00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,170
about what you want to be doing a year

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:28,510
from now five years from now 10 years

00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:29,650
from now in your retirement now I look

00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:33,280
around the room and I see a lot of

00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:38,230
people who appear to be in their 20s 30s

00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:41,380
a few 40s one or two older than that how

00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:42,760
many of us who are younger than 40 have

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:47,580
spent a whole lot of time thinking about

00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,580
what you're going to do in retirement

00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:55,120
not many hands why because you don't

00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:58,740
have time to most of us don't have time

00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,940
to we're too busy doing now right I

00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,100
haven't thought about what I'm gonna do

00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,750
when retiring I figure I'm gonna work

00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:09,270
and then one day I won't work and

00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:11,980
they'll bury me and that's that you know

00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:13,660
mistakes of my past i'm gonna die broke

00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,280
well that's all right you know I'll just

00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,630
work until I can't anymore and then

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,080
they'll put me in a box and that's that

00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:21,310
but most of us especially younger people

00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,890
haven't spent a lot of time thinking

00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:26,290
about that life goal that vision because

00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:28,720
we can't Alan gives us a way to organize

00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:30,669
the stuff on the runway so that we can

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,370
start thinking about that stuff but he

00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:34,960
doesn't tell us how to do that and he

00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:39,280
also doesn't try to sell us a planner

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:42,580
unlike Franklin Covey it is a it is an

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,860
agnostic method it is tool agnostic way

00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,250
of organizing the things you need to do

00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,139
it is

00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:51,050
it is intuitive and it's very flexible

00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:52,490
about what is a project the notion of a

00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:57,800
project is anything that's going to take

00:34:52,490 --> 00:35:00,320
two or more atomic steps that's all so

00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,860
rotating the tires could be one thing or

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,710
a whole bunch and you decide the level

00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,700
of atomicity that makes sense to you if

00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:10,610
taking out the trash is a multi-step

00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,900
process for you like if you're

00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,730
struggling with health issues and you

00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,930
get tired gathering up the trash and you

00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,390
have to wait a little while before you

00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:18,830
take it out to the street then you need

00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:21,890
to make it a two step process that's

00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:26,210
fine or if you can do that in 11 atomic

00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:28,190
project do it it can be context-driven

00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,930
he spends a lot of time talking about at

00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:34,430
the computer at email at the phone and

00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,440
this was designed around executive needs

00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:41,540
where they don't actually live on their

00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:42,860
computers like we do me you know I need

00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:45,590
a list of things that happen when I'm

00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:48,160
not at the computer other than sleep

00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:53,150
that leaves about an hour a day right

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:56,810
drive that's what I do if it's relevant

00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:58,640
to you to have context-driven lists so

00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:01,010
and I'll do this occasionally I'll

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,600
create an ad Aron's list and while I'm

00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:04,490
out driving around on saturday morning

00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,160
and running errands i'll just have a

00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:08,390
list of the ones i want to run i need to

00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,560
go here and here and here and here and

00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:11,300
get one of these and do one of those and

00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:16,790
drop off this and not another you can do

00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:18,050
that it is a little con Bonnie it's a

00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,490
little water folly because you're going

00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,780
to do this thing and then do this thing

00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:24,230
and then do this thing and then do this

00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:28,130
thing so it's a little little sequential

00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:30,590
in that it doesn't have the the lateral

00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:33,440
swim lanes of convent it has

00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:35,090
context-driven lists and it has the

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,070
notion of a next actions list and the

00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:39,970
next actions list is the list of all

00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:41,870
things that you could do right now

00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:45,380
everything that you need to do to

00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:50,300
prepare for that doing is done so you

00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:53,660
can now do that so for instance going

00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:56,480
back to the rotating the tires thing for

00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:58,340
drive to the shop to get to the next

00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,040
actions list you have to have already

00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,150
done all predecessor tasks you have to

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,190
have called made the appointment

00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,750
whatever you're going to do right you

00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,550
have to have withdrawn the money from

00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,200
your checking account or gotten ready to

00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:11,090
pay with your credit card and make sure

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,070
you have that all the predecessor tasks

00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:15,020
are done this is now a next action that

00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:18,740
I can choose to do the purpose is and he

00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:23,900
took a little bit of a little bit of

00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:27,080
brain work out of Henry Ford okay Henry

00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,980
Ford very much a double-edged sword but

00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,500
one of the things he did in

00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:32,990
manufacturing was if you're doing the

00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,340
same thing all day long you don't have

00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:37,730
to think a whole lot about what to do

00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:39,380
next right so if you're putting tires on

00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:41,360
a car you're mounting the tire and your

00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:45,290
screw and the lug nuts on you and you're

00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:48,380
done next car and you do the same thing

00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:52,790
over and over again David Allen calls

00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:55,070
that cranking widgets and his idea is

00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,930
very few of us especially those of us

00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:59,210
who don't work in manufacturing have

00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:02,510
that kind of repetitive one right after

00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:06,350
the other thing we don't really have

00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:08,180
that but if we can change the way we

00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:10,370
think about organizing that stuff so

00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,710
that when you finish one task you have

00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:15,500
an easy list to choose your next one

00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,760
from you can spend more time cranking

00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,700
those widgets even if there are

00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:23,570
different widgets then you do spending

00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:25,460
time thinking about what to do next so

00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:27,710
it's a little sprint II because you can

00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,480
also pull from the backlog so it has a

00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:34,820
little scrum flavor to it it's your

00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:36,290
backlog of stuff that can be done now it

00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:41,770
doesn't mean that stuff has to be done

00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:41,770
now it just means you can work on it now

00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:48,590
there are five pillars of getting things

00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:50,630
done capturing it and David Allen spends

00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:52,820
a great deal of time discussing this in

00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:56,200
his book in getting things done and in

00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:58,370
its its subsequent books your brain is

00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:02,330
absolutely the worst place to store your

00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:07,460
to-do list I see lots and nodding heads

00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:11,290
mm-hmm yeah or if I was to give you a

00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,290
list of six words

00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:15,929
that didn't relate to each other they

00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:17,609
were not all colors and they were not

00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:21,149
all actions they were not all verbs or

00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:23,519
nouns just six random words what are the

00:39:21,149 --> 00:39:27,559
chances you would remember all of them

00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:32,669
an hour from now approximately zero

00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:36,029
there's a few people and I know and him

00:39:32,669 --> 00:39:38,429
close to a few people who would the way

00:39:36,029 --> 00:39:40,649
their brains work that's fine they can

00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:43,229
remember that kind of listing most of us

00:39:40,649 --> 00:39:44,909
cannot and David Allen books at that and

00:39:43,229 --> 00:39:46,409
the other piece of the puzzle is you

00:39:44,909 --> 00:39:48,899
have this emotional involvement with the

00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:52,199
things you want to get done because you

00:39:48,899 --> 00:39:54,809
want them right so every time you pull

00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:56,399
up to the carport and you see that your

00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:58,319
garage is really cluttered and messy and

00:39:56,399 --> 00:40:00,499
you can't get your car in there you go

00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:02,789
deccan I need to clean that garage out

00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:04,559
every time dang it I need to clean that

00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:06,239
garage out when am i what am I going

00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:08,669
around to clean that Rajan and you get

00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,039
kind of wrapped up in that angst over

00:40:08,669 --> 00:40:12,779
not having the garage cleaned out with

00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,029
that stuff stored outside your head

00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:16,709
you'll walk past it and you'll go you

00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:22,289
know last week I decided I was not going

00:40:16,709 --> 00:40:24,269
to do that this week it's okay you've

00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:27,719
decided you've committed to yourself

00:40:24,269 --> 00:40:29,729
what things you want to get done so you

00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:33,119
don't fret about the ones you aren't

00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:34,889
it's okay capture all that stuff outside

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,229
your head put it on the list get it

00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:39,630
where you can reorder it reorganize it

00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:42,409
and establish their priorities without

00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:45,299
spending a lot of pain and suffering

00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:47,849
clarify this is the tasking out from

00:40:45,299 --> 00:40:50,159
scrum this is when you figure out how

00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:52,169
I'm going to do this this is how you

00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:56,909
figure out when you're going to do this

00:40:52,169 --> 00:40:59,039
is this thing time specific okay I'd

00:40:56,909 --> 00:41:03,509
like to go to the Houston bribe band

00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:05,309
concert on the thirtieth of May well

00:41:03,509 --> 00:41:08,909
that doesn't belong in my to-do list

00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:12,199
that belongs on my calendar because it's

00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:14,789
not going to move based on my priorities

00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:16,319
so then I can work around oh I'm going

00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:18,899
to the pride band concert tomorrow so I

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,299
can't do this other thing saturday

00:41:18,899 --> 00:41:22,619
afternoon put it on your calendar if

00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:24,149
it's time centric is not going to move

00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:25,910
put it in calendar and leave it there

00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:28,350
don't worry about it after

00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:31,590
that doesn't mean calendar the cleaning

00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:33,090
out the garage that means when you start

00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,619
evaluating that week and figuring out

00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,150
what you want to do you go well you know

00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:37,350
I was gonna clean throws and sorry but

00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,869
I've got this concert so I'm not gonna

00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:41,220
put a scratch this week it's fine and

00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:44,610
you can renegotiate those things with

00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,810
yourself until you get to this is what

00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:48,680
I'm going to get done and feel good

00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:52,560
about organizing it that's priorities

00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:56,400
reflecting on it how important is it to

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,830
me really to get this done do you

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,930
occasionally find yourself doing

00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:05,670
something and you can't remember why

00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:08,730
what's the value here what do I get out

00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:11,280
of this now if you're if you're kind of

00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:13,530
compulsive about certain things you

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,060
might find yourself cleaning your garage

00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,940
at some time when you didn't really

00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:20,700
expect to because it's bugging you

00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:22,830
that's fine but reflecting on that helps

00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:25,110
you know yourself better and know why

00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:26,940
you do those things and what is the

00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:28,619
value of doing the things that are on

00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,330
your list this gives you a chance to

00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:32,250
establish the value that's the work of

00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:35,609
the product owner and scrum you are your

00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:36,840
own product owner ok and then engaging

00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:38,550
getting in there and doing the work

00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,140
crank that widget pick up the next one

00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,850
and do another one you can get a lot

00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,920
done that way if you know what your next

00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:46,920
actions are you have a great long list

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,119
of next actions man you can crank you

00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,280
spend a Saturday when you're not working

00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:51,540
doing that stuff you just Bam Bam Bam

00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,609
knock out a whole bunch of stuff because

00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:59,640
you don't have to think about what to do

00:42:53,609 --> 00:43:02,450
next you just do GTD has the notion of

00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:05,220
the inbox the inbox is the place for

00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:09,030
things that are not yet clarified you

00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:10,440
might have more than one your email you

00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:13,680
might have a paper in box like this

00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:18,119
picture on your desk I have one on my

00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,890
desk at home you're going to check it

00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,410
periodically for high priority items

00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:24,090
this is especially true at work if your

00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:26,790
boss wants you to do something drop it

00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:29,100
in your inbox but don't stop doing what

00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:31,440
you're doing unless they really raise

00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,640
the priority interrupt you know if you

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,010
get a priority in trip from your boss

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,150
take it that's fine but if the boss says

00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:38,510
you know when you get around to it could

00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:40,220
you do this don't stop

00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:42,710
doing what you're doing finish cranking

00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:46,250
the widget you're on then pick that item

00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:50,420
up and decide where it lands in the

00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:52,040
priority amongst your next tasks okay

00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,030
you want to sweep it clean off and you

00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,800
don't want a lot of stuff loitering

00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,860
around your inbox you want an empty

00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,020
inbox inbox zero you'll hear it called I

00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:04,670
have a handful of emails in my mouth in

00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:07,040
my gmail box maybe 10 and that's high

00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:11,420
for me normally I have about three or

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:14,890
four in my inbox everything else has

00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:18,280
been filed or dealt with and deleted

00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:20,600
file it if I need to refer to it again

00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:24,320
somebody says I need you to do this once

00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:26,810
I've done that thing gone don't keep

00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,310
that stuff you don't it's not very often

00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:31,070
you really need to keep that kind of a

00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:32,720
record if you do great but archive it

00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:35,540
put it somewhere other than your inbox

00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,050
keep your inbox clean in some items as i

00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:41,630
said earlier may move to your calendar

00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:44,480
if if my friend David airdrops a flyer

00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:48,020
on my desk for the Houston pride band

00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,730
concert Oh they've set the time and date

00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,370
for the next concert here's a here's a

00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:53,510
flyer about it I'm going to see that

00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:55,850
piece of paper I'm going to handle that

00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:57,290
piece of paper exactly once i'm going to

00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:58,910
put stuff in my calendar and I'm going

00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:01,490
to throw the piece of paper away cuts

00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:03,590
clutter in my life it's out of my inbox

00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:07,580
it's on my calendar and I can forget

00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:09,680
about it until the week of now if I

00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:12,550
realize that this is a formal and I need

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,780
a new dress then that adds tasks and

00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:15,920
those tasks have deadlines and that's

00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:19,940
fine because it needs to happen before

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,590
the concert but I know that and can

00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:24,110
establish that when i pick up that piece

00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:26,330
of paper i handle it once and i've got

00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:28,160
all the all of the predecessor tasks

00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:33,080
lined up I've got it on the calendar

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:37,070
everything's ready to go so you've seen

00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:39,050
to kind of different methods and they at

00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:42,320
the core the notion is try to get

00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:44,480
organized can we take the best of both

00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:48,160
and I think the answer is absolutely yes

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,870
we've talked about when do you decide

00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,100
which way to go at some when do you not

00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:54,530
do scrum with

00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:58,460
if you don't do scrum do getting things

00:45:54,530 --> 00:46:00,230
done or con bond or something else ok

00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:02,060
there's remarkable similarities in both

00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:03,770
systems both of them are very

00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:05,240
introspective when done in sole

00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:07,580
practitioners you're spending a lot of

00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:12,380
time thinking about your own values your

00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:17,390
own capabilities your own capacity your

00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:19,580
own requirements for satisfaction so if

00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:22,130
you clean out the garage will that make

00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:25,190
you happier will you feel better about

00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:28,850
yourself having done that is there some

00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:30,230
greater value to that you know besides

00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:31,670
being able to put your car in there

00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:33,950
instead of having to leave it out under

00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:35,650
the carport you know what are your you

00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:37,460
spend time introspecting and that's good

00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:40,250
transparency again you're getting it out

00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:42,470
of your head now some of my lists I

00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:45,410
share with my daughter who lives with me

00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:47,840
our shopping list and the household

00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:50,810
to-do list the cleaning house list I

00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:53,330
share with my daughter so that she knows

00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:55,520
when those things were last done or if I

00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:57,890
want them done or if she wants something

00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,680
done or pick this up next time we're at

00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:02,000
the grocery store next time either one

00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,440
of us goes to the grocery store we're

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,160
going to try to pick everything off the

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,570
shopping list and if I need to put

00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,880
something on the shopping list and she's

00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:13,610
going shopping after work and she gets

00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:16,910
off at noon and i'm at work at nine in

00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:18,560
the morning oh I need more toothpaste I

00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:22,220
can put it on there and it'll be there

00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:24,440
when I get home from work at four just

00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:25,850
works transparency gets it out of your

00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,890
head you don't have to remember that you

00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:30,620
need toothpaste you get it there so that

00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:33,650
anybody who can act on it whether that's

00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:36,710
just you or your shared list can be

00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,540
acted on flexibility you decide the

00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:41,360
atomicity of a project you decide when

00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:43,700
it needs to be scoped out to scrum when

00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:45,260
it needs to be written out longer if you

00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,000
know what you're going to do you know

00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:49,490
how you're going to implement this maybe

00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,580
you don't need that you decide and it's

00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:56,060
tool agnostic there are a whole bunch of

00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:59,750
online GTD up applications does anybody

00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:02,780
use remember the milk okay does anybody

00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:04,430

wonderless just got bought by microsoft

00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:08,260
i'm a little scared

00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,820
yeah we're a little scared german

00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:12,850
company they're fantastic and then they

00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:16,000
got bought Microsoft oh they say there's

00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:20,320
not going to be any changes we shall see

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,080
what about other GTD apps anybody got

00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:27,730
one that they're really pleased with

00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:30,040
anybody doing GTD OmniFocus okay on the

00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:32,680
Macintosh the thing I like about winter

00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,450
list is it's on my computer here it's on

00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:41,050
my computer at home it's on my phone and

00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:43,030
it's on my tablet yeah being able to see

00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:45,160
it across you know multiples is a good

00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:46,780
thing all right it's tool agnostic you

00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,760
pick your tools all right let's take a

00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:54,040
look at my tool real quick okay hmm

00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:56,620
Trello Trello is Trello is kind of swim

00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,760
landing it's a little con Bonnie but if

00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:00,160
that works for you there's nothing wrong

00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,660
with that and you can and you can

00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,750
rearrange your swim lines to do what you

00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:09,130
want them to do yeah so so i use

00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:14,890
Wunderlist and and here's my current

00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:16,870
lists I have an inbox the inbox is for

00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:20,980
things that I want to spend more time on

00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:22,960
later so for instance I've heard a

00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:25,840
couple of things here at the conference

00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,410
that I want to explore more later and I

00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:31,540
heard these things in talks yesterday

00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:35,380
the stuff i heard you know in talks on

00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:36,730
Monday I've already processed so many

00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,560
things how do you do that when you throw

00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:40,870
a party near remember that what because

00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,550
it doesn't take long once you get system

00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:44,890
down moving these things through doesn't

00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:46,330
take as much time okay so here's my

00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:48,700
inbox these are things i want to look

00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:51,760
into more and see how they might impact

00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:53,440
my world do I want to do something with

00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,000
blurred will it change how I do blogging

00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,650
probably not but I want to explore

00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,300
because I might want to enhance the

00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:00,310
blogging system i'm currently using to

00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:03,730
do some of the neat tricks that plur

00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:06,550
does and i saw this presentation

00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:07,780
unplugged yesterday went that's neat so

00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:08,800
I just wrote blurred in there they'd

00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:11,290
forgot about it don't worry about it

00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,870
okay stuff that's coming up during the

00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:15,490
week has due dates here's my

00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:19,480
housekeeping list here's the shopping

list you know clean the house list

00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,869
these are things that and and then I

00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:27,490
need a reminder because I have a lot of

00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:29,500
in boxes yeah because i have Evernote

00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:31,320
Web Clipper so when I clip something I

00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:33,810
need to go back and do something with it

00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:35,980
like read that article or whatever or

00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:39,940
check your voicemails and make sure all

00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:41,530
of them are gone I the best way to get

00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,420
hold of me is not voicemail its text

00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:46,810
leave me a text message I hate voicemail

00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:48,369
I despise it but you know I need to

00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:50,680
check it periodically and I have two of

00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:52,150
them so you know check through these

00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,580
things and make sure you've processed

00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:58,210

00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:10,780
things that I need to do all right I

00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:14,500
need to call the rose and schedule a

00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:17,619
checkup it's the Women's Health Center

00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:19,270
in Houston one of them and I need to

00:51:17,619 --> 00:51:21,070
visit the County Courthouse I've filled

00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:22,330
out the gotten my doctor to fill out the

00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:24,820
forms that i need to put handicap

00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:26,050
license plates on my car and now all i

00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:29,440
got to do is go to the County Courthouse

00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:31,210
turn in the form get them and then I can

00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,359
have a task and there's a task in my

00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:35,560
backlog to mount the plates on the car

00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:39,670
separate task I don't have to do it at

00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:41,560
the courthouse it's not atomic you know

00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:43,869
I built a lap desk a while ago and it's

00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,670
too wide for my chair kind of hangs off

00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:47,800
the end so I need to saw it off and

00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:50,530
smooth that in this stuff like this this

00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,090
is my next actions list all right and I

00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:54,490
have some someday maybe some things that

00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:55,900
I might like to do it sometime like this

00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:57,250
looks interesting so I might want to

00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:59,740
explore that or I might want to do that

00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:01,240
later and then I have some long-term

00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,859
goals and these are the things that I

00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:08,020
want to accomplish a year five years

00:52:02,859 --> 00:52:10,859
from now okay here's where I do scrum i

00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:15,700
have a blog called members on the spines

00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:21,160
where I blog about romance books and it

00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:23,940
uses wordpress I know don't start and i

00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:27,310
recently changed from using a free text

00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:28,660
extended field to using a taxonomy and i

00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:31,119
still need to move some things from the

00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:33,250
old text fields into the taxonomy i did

00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,609
that as a scrum task that's really kind

00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,980
of a che

00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:39,099
because the value is so that other users

00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:40,779
can search it which is a good external

00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:41,980
value but it's kind of an atomic thing

00:52:40,779 --> 00:52:46,029
I'm not really going to try to split

00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:47,289
that into subtasks and I talked about

00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:52,660
readers form the other day of my

00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:56,799
lightning talk here's where I do mice

00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:58,150
crummiest scrum all right as a new user

00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:59,920
i'd like to be able to create account so

00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:02,920
i can log in and explore reader swarm

00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:06,329
I'm working on that I have some other

00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:09,249
stories here that our user stories

00:53:06,329 --> 00:53:12,309
what's the value who's going to be

00:53:09,249 --> 00:53:14,349
getting the win here without

00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:16,259
implementation details I'm not telling

00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:19,930
you how I'm going to connect to gravatar

00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:22,839
the answer is there's about 500 Sipan

00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:26,519
modules and I can take my pic but I

00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:31,599
haven't done that yet I have some bugs

00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:35,859
and yes dan has some bugs in reader's

00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,910
forum and then down here is my backlog

00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:38,859
and these are things that I haven't

00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:40,210
turned in his stories yet their ideas

00:53:38,859 --> 00:53:41,710
and things that I've thought about and

00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:43,119
said you know I could build one of these

00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:45,160
into this or I can make this work in

00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,619
this way and I've just given myself a

00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,970
note to tickle me later and when I run

00:53:47,619 --> 00:53:50,710
out of stuff up here that's what I'm

00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:52,269
going to reach into that and turn some

00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:56,769
of those into stories but I know that

00:53:52,269 --> 00:53:58,749
all of this needs to be done first all

00:53:56,769 --> 00:54:00,759
of its got to fall behind these things

00:53:58,749 --> 00:54:02,410
this in this initial plumbing is kind of

00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:05,470
important to the system so that's what

00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:09,099
I'm going to do okay you see how I've

00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:11,739
got both scrum and non scrum tasks in

00:54:09,099 --> 00:54:13,989
the same tool and if I've assigned due

00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:15,759
dates to those things then in the today

00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:18,210
box which pops up automatically if

00:54:15,759 --> 00:54:21,489
there's anything due today or overdue

00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:25,119
they show up and in the week they show

00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:27,759
up in the date order so I can see what

00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:30,789
my next actions are and each week as

00:54:27,759 --> 00:54:33,009
part of the GTD process you look at your

00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:34,869
backlog and decide the things you want

00:54:33,009 --> 00:54:38,160
to get done that week and you put due

00:54:34,869 --> 00:54:41,019
dates on them of the following weekend

00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:44,849
so that you know these are the things i

00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:47,500
want to get done this week and

00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:48,910
wunderlist also handles recurring tasks

00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,190
so those routines that you need to

00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:53,830
remind yourself to do every week whether

00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:55,540
that's you know take out the trash or

00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:56,710
play out the litter box or whatever it

00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,630
is you need to do every day or every

00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,610
week you can do that in here or every

00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:01,840
month okay you know you're supposed to

00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:04,270
turn your mattress every four months

00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,380
right everybody knows that unless you

00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,430
have an air bed or something you're

00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,600
supposed to write if you have a

00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:10,630
conventional mattress you're supposed to

00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:12,670
rotate the thing right my mattress

00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:14,350
actually has it came from a hotel supply

00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:17,320
and it has a sticker on it that says in

00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:19,030
July turn this way you know so when I

00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:22,210
change the sheets I see it but if you

00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:25,090
don't you can set a reminder every three

00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:26,610
months to do this thing you can set a

00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:29,140
reminder to change the oil in your car

00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:33,190
instead of that lame little sticker that

00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:34,690
they always put in your car okay some

00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:38,170
final thoughts and then we'll have a

00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:40,210
little time for questions a very little

00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:44,080
time for questions do what works for you

00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:45,730
this is my system I am me you will

00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:49,900
figure out something that works for you

00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:52,030
given time in iterations find your own

00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,740
dividing line you know where you need to

00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:57,100
switch to scrum you will figure it out

00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:59,020
over time what works when you need to

00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:01,150
divide and switch into scrum mode for

00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:02,860
something and especially if you need to

00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:04,930
think about implementation details if

00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,550
you need to spend time noodling over

00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:08,950
those details that's a good candidate

00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:10,330
for that all right and you will fail

00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,770
some there will be times where you fall

00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:15,100
off the wagon and don't log into

00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:17,560
Wunderlist for weeks on end it's okay

00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:19,660
don't beat yourself up don't give up

00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:21,880
keep trying remember there is no magic

00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:23,640
bullet there's no magic tool that's

00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:26,620
suddenly going to make you organized

00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:28,780
without you're putting some effort into

00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:32,050
it I've put a lot of effort into my

00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:35,320
lists you see how extensive that left

00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:37,930
pane was is lots of stuff I've put a ton

00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:39,280
of work into that spend time figuring

00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:41,380
out a system that works for you and

00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,820
that's okay if you don't do that in the

00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:48,090
first iteration you won't accept that

00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:51,090
okay go forth and get yourself organized

00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:51,090
questions

00:56:51,269 --> 00:57:04,390
gosh that was easy slowly because I get

00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:06,099
tied up with work you know my bosses

00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:10,949
want me to get other stuff done Russell

00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:10,949
you're not trolling me are you what what

00:57:12,689 --> 00:57:25,119
yes lawful neutral lawfulness lawful

00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:28,150
neutral yes any others we are out of

00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:31,390
