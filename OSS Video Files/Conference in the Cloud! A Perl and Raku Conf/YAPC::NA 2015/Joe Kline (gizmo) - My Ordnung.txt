okay all right

00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:18,600
all right hey there we go

00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,160
you

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,420
you

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:55,209
alrighty um I guess we'll start welcome

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,120
to my are done first I'll start off with

00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:00,250
saying John's getting to go to a post-op

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,030
or pre-op my post-op pre-op for surgery

00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:08,379
so thoughts for him a little bit about

00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,790
me I'm Joe Klein I'm gizmo math boy just

00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:12,400
about everywhere eighty to ninety

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,790
percent guaranteed thanks to Vicki for

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,810
recommending archive.org for my slide

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:22,169
repo I've had a long time interest in

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,580
the history of science and technology

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,900
starting with Isaac asthma I mean he

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,860
wrote a lot more than just science

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,949
fiction and then the 90s you know kind

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,630
of feeding that history thing there's a

00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:36,539
show called this old pyramid as a PBS

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,560
little one one-off thing talked about

00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:41,400
how did they build the pyramids because

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,770
we really don't know so they try to use

00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,620
methods they might have used in terms of

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,030
tools and resources and how to do it and

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:53,470
I think the thing that came out of that

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:55,570
that made sense to me was they wrapped

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:58,270
the ramp around instead of one big ramp

00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,740
because that's as big a engineering feat

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,960
and that's been modified by some

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,289
researchers since then that was cool

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,180
also feeding the how I view science and

00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:09,910
history of science as James Burke he

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,639
this series called connections when I

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,610
grew up progress was like the march of

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,930
science on one in he had sharp sticks on

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,270
the other hand he had plowshares and

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:22,330
what he basically said well it's a

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:25,210
drunken walk really we had air

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:29,710
conditioning in eighteen in the 1840s to

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:32,680
try and cure malaria it didn't so they

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,660
kind of threw it away and we didn't get

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,650
air conditioned as a tool until the

00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,060
nineteen twenty so we would knock a

00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,770
hundred years between hey we have our

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,490
conditioning to hey let's use it for

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,720
actually keeping us cold and he also did

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,020
a follow-up series called the day the

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,699
universe changed about how an idea comes

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,800
along and just totally destroys our

00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:54,219
worldview so I mean it kind of fed all

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,020
that but now the meat of the talk the

00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:59,449
ordinal what it is this is definition

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,750
it's how the Amish and various sects of

00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:03,710
the Amish and offshoots live their lives

00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,270
it's kind of derived from the German

00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:09,199
word ordinal of course where I'm you

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:13,250
know rules structure organization but

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,830
for them it's not a written rule it's

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,020
evolved it's an inherent thing they live

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,159
it so they don't it's like you rules

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,419
your family you don't write down the

00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,650
rules if I mean you don't sit up

00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,930
straight at the dinner table you don't

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,099
you know put your face in your plate um

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,569
you don't have to write that down

00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:29,900
because you live in a reminded of it as

00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:32,319
a daily part of your life and each

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,389
church and community has their own

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,340
ordinal and most of my talk and research

00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:39,380
is based off of this book and plus the

00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,599
lights personal stuff so and that's a

00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,159
really good book if you want to see how

00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:47,380
the Amish evolve the rules and how it

00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:49,940
makes sense to them this is a kitchen

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,669
looks pretty much like any kitchen the

00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,500
USA but this is a kind of a modern Amish

00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:56,919
kitchen um and specifically I mean I'm

00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:00,319
talking most about the Lancaster Amish

00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:02,630
there's a light above the sink that's a

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,550
gas maybe battery powered above the

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,009
stove that's a battery powered light

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,169
above a gas stove doesn't violate any of

00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:11,449
their rules you don't see there's

00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:13,789
probably a refrigerator but it's

00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:16,909
probably gas-powered they're just like

00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:19,599
we are for the most part they live kind

00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:22,940
of more the 19th century than the 20th

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,490
but them unless we like to do the same

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,370
things their kids liked road blade oddly

00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,830
enough bikes aren't allowed the most

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,860
part but scooters and rural rates are so

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,930
I'm not going to go to that but but

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,490
their relationship and the rules are

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,500
reflection of their that there the

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:43,550
relationship with their God and their

00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:49,310
community and their family every talks

00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:52,669
about electricity and Amish in the US it

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,289
was until nineteen forty six that eighty

00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:55,400
percent the US had electricity so they

00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,990
really don't have to worry about it we

00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,370
didn't have to over it electricity has

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,389
only been around the US as a de facto

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:04,069
thing for like what's at seventy years

00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:07,800
they really didn't have to confront the

00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:09,750
use of electricity until the 60s

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,400
the wholesalers a lot of families in the

00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:15,060
Amish community made their living by

00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,650
dairy soy milk off the whole cells can

00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,659
set all we need to make some changes

00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,210
with how we do things we need to have

00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:23,580
the milk and bolt canx it's okay then

00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:26,159
don't they had no prom with that has to

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,210
be chilled it's like well we can do that

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:29,539
within you know they had little

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:33,419
generators that powered like 12 out

00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:35,430
systems that cooled the milk we need you

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:38,909
have to stir it automatically every four

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:40,769
to six hours to keep the rain from

00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,329
separating and promoting bacterial

00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:44,099
growth that kind of freaked them out a

00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:46,050
little bit but they found a way to work

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,670
with that you know in terms of with the

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:51,000
battery system the little way they use

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:53,640
the electricity then they said we need

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,060
to pick it up on sunday and ah I said

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,920
hell no that's the Sabbath and then then

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,420
the whole says okay you bent your rules

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,279
for you know the electricity and stuff

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,480
like that okay we can pick it up on

00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:07,380
either you know Saturday night or Monday

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,570
learn cool and so they use electricity

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,339
they it's evolved over time for the most

00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,620
part there's like a 12-volt rule if it

00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,970
can be running 12 volts and a battery

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,320
they'll do it they won't use public

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,320
utilities if it comes from the outside

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,899
world doesn't count they use

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,790
high-voltage electricity for welders

00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,320
because they need to repair their

00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,140
equipment like older equipment that

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,339
isn't made anymore modern equipment so

00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,540
they made an exception for that because

00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:36,120
it keeps the the farmers doing what they

00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:40,110
need to do wait and more recently

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,329
they've started using inverters because

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,040
they need some things that need 110

00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:45,690
volts like computers because

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,480
spreadsheets are a hell of a drug for

00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,339
the Amish businesses and they

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,930
intellectually no they call it kind of

00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,940
grown their own electricity the

00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,800
intellectually know that going from 12

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,339
volts to hundreds of effort inverter is

00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:03,899
the same electricity but it's a

00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:05,250
inconvenience and a willful step to

00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,660
create the tricity for their knees plus

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,449
it prevents on what they kind of call

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,790
the cascade effect oh I got this 110

00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:14,850
volt power knocking of tvs and dvds and

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,980
all this other crap so they kind of work

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,110
within that framework it's excited that

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,209
makes no sense from the outside but it's

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:28,670
in terms of how they evolve it in

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:28,670
make sense guess what this is telephone

00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:35,249
the Amish yeah it's like uh technical

00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:38,550
telephone chain your son like that the

00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:40,319
Amish call phones half conversations

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,860
because a big part of their life is

00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:46,050
socialized people drop in and talk in in

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,779
phones you don't hear the nonverbal

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,670
communications part they they don't like

00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:52,379
that so I said they kind of out load

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,670
phones not only out loud and they said

00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:55,889
okay if you going to use a phone it has

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,559
to be a willful Act has to be separate

00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:59,850
from the house the Amish like the rest

00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,149
of us they find ways to kind of bend the

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:05,399
rules a little bit like Amish business

00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:08,009
his desks here there's a window to an

00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,879
outside room building to the phone and

00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:11,639
just kind of reaches through and gets

00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,199
the phone and ask you know so um it's a

00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,860
deliberate act to use this technology

00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:20,550
doesn't interrupt their flow of life it

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:23,249
also talked about how my room but let's

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,999
talk about me what makes me hi my name

00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:30,179
is joe i'm a tech hoarder I like

00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:33,269
technology I get lots of tech I like

00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:34,769
Linux i'ma zealot about it but not so

00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:38,279
pure that rms would keep me in his

00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:40,110
church but I my life I'm kind of

00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:44,329
agnostic about it for the most part but

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:46,529
I'm alone Excel it sure windows is evil

00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,939
but it's not gonna mean max use those

00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:51,179
guys brains are just wired differently

00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:56,970
than us let's knock the brains are

00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:59,850
broken I think pearls the best language

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:02,939
ever that being said that's kind of

00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,230
where I'm coming from this is kind of

00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:07,139
where I got at the start of I didn't

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,839
call it my Oregon the time but so it's a

00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:12,629
quote from sokrates the unexamined life

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,429
is not worth living that's brutal it's

00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:16,740
like throw your life away if you're not

00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:18,209
looking at it but I think it's a good

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,579
starting point look at your life what

00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:21,899
are you doing why are you doing it

00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:25,189
especially nowadays with the quantified

00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:30,120
self moment we have a really good way to

00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:33,360
examine our lives in amazing ways it's

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,710
also informed by a Douglas rushkoff and

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,780
specifically his book programmer

00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:39,420
be programmed Ten Commandments for the

00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,460
digital age these are the ten just show

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,260
up in free to look at but it's only the

00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,620
first two that kind of relate to this

00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:49,080
talk in my ordinal don't always be on

00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:52,140
you don't have to be connected to

00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,580
everything all the time you can put you

00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,190
can close the browser and you can put

00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:00,210
the phone away the computer away and

00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:02,760
just not be connected and be live in

00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:05,310
person when you're with somebody be with

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,100
them be with people is the highest

00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:10,020
bandwidth form of communication we have

00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,030
we cannot get fast communication between

00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,240
two people standing in a whiteboard

00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:17,840
exchange information we do have ways

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,920
around I mean video chat kind of gets us

00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,620
contd be next to each other but when you

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,970
would somebody be with them a lot of

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,590
times are with me I'll have my phone of

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,190
course with me and you'll see me put it

00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,240
down face down that serves two purposes

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,700
protect the screen because i want to get

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,040
cracked but also makes it harder for me

00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,880
to see my communication things are

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:42,840
happening to me nothing happened making

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,610
this talk my wife said you spent a lot

00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,140
of time on twitter like for a guy that

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,910
self examines his life that's kind of a

00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,840
flat don't you think and she's right i

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,430
mean it's nice to have someone on the

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,150
outside hey years you're doing something

00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:55,770
weird but this is my phone's home screen

00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:58,890
this is how I spend my digital life on

00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:00,390
my phone everything that's on the lower

00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,130
right hand corner is within easy reach

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:06,990
my thumb because I mean this is a huge

00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:08,940
phone so and we have an interesting

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:14,010
relationship with technology it changes

00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:17,760
over time day-to-day uses things change

00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:22,620
our preferences change how we consume

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,360
things change but also sometimes the

00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:29,640
convenience and utility of the tools we

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:31,320
use aren't always there something that

00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,100
does the is with you all the time you'll

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,620
use more even though it's not the best

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:42,150
so sometimes good enough and being with

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:44,040
you is good and if I had to be tied down

00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,260
say what's part of your order these are

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,700
four parts it kind of talks about the

00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,360
other utility perfect is the enemy the

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,220
good

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,250
I don't need a perfect solution the

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,269
greatest shiniest newest technology stop

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:58,380
and think about why you want the tech

00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:00,269
what I want the new foot why do I want

00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,420
the new s6 why do I want you know iphone

00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:05,220
6 and why do I need it also how does it

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,560
fit your life do I need the shiniest

00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:12,470
phone is mostly use my phone to do

00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:16,110
Twitter and you know a calendar and

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:17,970
talking with my wife do you really need

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:20,339
it do I really need the greatest

00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:23,399
shiniest neatest phone no go any other

00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:27,649
great science laptop no I find ways to

00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:29,940
adapt in my pressure professional life

00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:32,670
I've always been kind of a supporter

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,380
I've never been the person that made the

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:36,329
cool new idea or as a software architect

00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,660
I always kind of came along afterwards

00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:41,970
and supported that infrastructure or

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,880
that person and making tools kind of

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:48,060
making sure things were working and so

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:53,339
over and over I became agnostic about

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:54,660
technology I made sure that what the

00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:56,550
people needed to do their job is

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,220
whatever their environment they're using

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,620
whatever operating system using whatever

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,540
application using can they do their job

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,060
effectively and efficiently with that

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:09,029
technology regardless of my biases I'm a

00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:13,279
like Linux a lot but if the applications

00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:13,279
only in windows we got to have windows

00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:20,459
open source communities have an order

00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:24,019
model all organizations have Norman

00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:27,389
sometimes its formal sometimes it's not

00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:29,069
you decide what version control system

00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:30,720
using how do you accept commits what

00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:32,850
features and kind of features you commit

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,790
here's a couple examples in the Pearl

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,339
community on the tube mojolicious wants

00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,499
to be on the bleeding edge of web

00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:43,199
frameworks and technology backwards

00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:45,899
compatibility is not in their missions

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,100
so to speak but because of that they

00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,589
have a really good deprecation policy

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,879
they are they're going to tell you

00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:57,059
what's going to break in the next

00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:59,579
version which is good perlin 518 up here

00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:02,189
you can see that too much they they

00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:06,329
introduce a process of how do we deal

00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:10,289
with features new features get tagged as

00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:14,339
experimental and when they become

00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:17,429
accepted the tag goes away and you ever

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:19,289
get the flag and if it doesn't become

00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:25,319
accepted for some period of time it goes

00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:27,089
away as of yet since the 518 Delta they

00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,439
there hasn't been a feature it's kind of

00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:30,690
done this so it's still kind of Amorphis

00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:36,179
but we haven't we have a process to how

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:39,409
we deal with new features we do all of

00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:43,799
this I do all this to try and not be

00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:45,120
letting technology isolate me it can be

00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:48,480
very isolating it can also be very

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,750
empowering we can be trapped by our cell

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,120
phones this is a mural by a local artist

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,789
contact meddler I need a series of you

00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,679
know talking about information

00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:01,230
technology you know get a shout out to

00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:05,940
it to him and then the people that made

00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:07,500
that art the Amish have there or known

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,169
to preserve social capital to the

00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,019
preserve the interactions they make

00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:14,519
bargains with the world constantly they

00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:16,889
don't want the world to intrude on them

00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:18,059
and how they live but when they do make

00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:21,899
those bargains they have guiding

00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:24,139
principles that help them with that and

00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:28,169
lex like i said i mean the-they fork if

00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:29,230
they think the rules aren't good they'll

00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:36,590
up and move and go

00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:39,550
so so examine your life act on that find

00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:42,640
a relationship with technology that

00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:45,790
works with your communities your family

00:18:42,640 --> 00:19:06,530
your friends and hope its balance one

00:18:45,790 --> 00:19:12,260
thank you any questions no hold on yes

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:20,660
have your Laurel here and to go to the

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:21,890
Ten Commandments do there is so it's a

00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,370
good book I mean for the most part I

00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:28,820
mean you didn't oh it's a program or B

00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:30,860
program is the name of the book so any

00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:40,700
other questions I'll just talk about

00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:41,810
that then oh that's right yak said well

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,460
you'll be able in the abstract so we

00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,780
know later I just haven't update that

00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,180
before the class what's interesting

00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,730
about the the the rush cuff book he

00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:51,820
talks about you know kind of comes later

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,840
in terms of if you don't understand

00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,280
technology and you don't actually have

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,630
to be a programmer and have program the

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,550
sea you'll be controlled by others that

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,280
do you know kind of like the letters up

00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:06,410
he didn't talk about is if you have an

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,210
automatic car that has a problem then

00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,860
you go Google hug Havers ago mechanic

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,200
then to look at it if you'd understand

00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:14,650
that Google searches are manipulated by

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,640
people you don't maybe not know that the

00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:21,410
top-rated mechanic may not be the best

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:28,270
mechanic for you so as an aside any

00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:28,270
other questions yes no maybe this

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:44,360
yes it does thank you much Sokrates I

00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:49,909
thought trago do that but you know I am

00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:51,409
wanted you to do it so all right after

00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:52,549
another for the questions have a good

00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:54,850
conference for its up to it and thank

00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:54,850
you very much
