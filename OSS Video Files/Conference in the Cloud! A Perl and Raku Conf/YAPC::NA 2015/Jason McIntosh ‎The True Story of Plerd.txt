hello lately I've been eating a lot of

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,250
salad this has been part of an ongoing

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:14,219
conscious effort on my part to exercise

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,350
everyday and pay more care to what I eat

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,900
I know from being alive with myself for

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,430
a long time which indeed relates to the

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,400
root of the problem that I wouldn't

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,410
cotton to any radical or branded diets

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,320
so I thought it best to aim for modest

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,609
changes in my routine behavior I'd

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,980
already done this successfully with

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,809
exercise utterly uninterested in joining

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,210
a gym and not into sports or indeed

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,920
anything I couldn't just do by myself I

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,980
went through a personal evolution from

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,320
Wii Fit and Xbox Kinect training before

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,300
landing on the seven-minute workout in

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,120
food I've also eschewed radical

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,309
lifestyle disruption in favor of modest

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,840
changes such as not even cutting out

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,120
desserts but just not casually eating

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,020
cake whenever I see one in a pastry case

00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:02,760
and eating greens more often poor crafts

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:06,150
is a great recent comic book by C spike

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,220
Trotman and Diana nock aimed at folks

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,650
who whether by dint of youth or by a

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,200
change of fortunes are new to

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,909
independent living it offers life advice

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,700
through a delightfully Illustrated

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,259
Socratic dialogue between two women one

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,390
of whom has her life together rather a

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:25,170
bit more than the other it's a book I

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,790
wish I had read 20 years ago however I

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,670
was interested to see it vectoring the

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,590
meme that prepared foods of any kind is

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,369
a poor use of one's limited budget and

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,770
it calls out in particular the notion of

00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:39,600
salad in a bag this certainly wasn't the

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,220
first time I might heard this and how

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,560
can you argue with it it's right in the

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,990
numbers to buy bagged lettuce is to pay

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,610
more for less nobody with an ounce of

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,649
common sense once presented with the

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,159
evidence would ever buy bagged lettuce

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,140
over whole right except here's the thing

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,880
until I finally let myself move past

00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,100
this thinking I barely ate any greens at

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,530
all once I did give myself permission to

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,570
spend a little extra on bagged salads I

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,180
found myself eating the stuff every day

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,840
this isn't to say poor crafts logic is

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,670
wrong it isn't it's objectively true but

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,460
it still took me a while to realize that

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,140
I had to give

00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,630
I had to give it a little interpretive

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,370
spin before would work well in my own

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,110
life and start benefiting my health

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,780
these sorts of things are not always

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,940
obvious

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:28,030
sometimes I see blogs as the garden

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,650
salads of the web of the social web it's

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,170
not the easiest cheapest way to get a

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,060
hit of fresh text or news anymore or to

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,530
quickly share births of textual

00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,230
information without having to actually

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,090
compose or organize it first Twitter is

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:43,180
amazing at fostering connections and

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,070
sharing ideas quickly but and I feel no

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,010
shame or regret over its centrality to

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,300
my own life over the last several years

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,790
but in all the ways that social media

00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,700
excel at connection they invariably fall

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,380
short when it comes to reflection

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,060
historians regard the Gettysburg Address

00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,320
is one of the most powerfully succinct

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,930
written works in Western civilization

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:05,220
but Twitter sees it only as an order of

00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:08,290
magnitude too long Arthur Schopenhauer

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,510
once quipped the first 40 years of life

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,760
gives a give us the text and the next 30

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,260
supply the commentary when I first heard

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,200
that I thought it sounded pretty gross

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,210
even fatalistic and I rejected it on its

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,110
face more recently though I've

00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,880
encountered a more positive

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,400
interpretation offered by the Stack

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,050
Exchange user medaka who related the

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,850
quote to Socrates his own words about

00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,310
the value of the unexamined life and

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,140
suggested that at a certain age one

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,800
begins to feel the calm to not simply do

00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,270
but also to reflect this resonated with

00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,280
me as it reminded me of a brush with

00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,140
oblivion I had late last year when I

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,840
discovered the origin of the idiom see

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:47,160
change from Ariel's song in The Tempest

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,690
and I was overcome by its beauty and

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,640
deeply troubled by the realization that

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,340
my time left to discover such things was

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,430
limited as were my channels for sharing

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,260
them while I could I felt similarly at

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,260
around the same time when my cat wrote a

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,240
poem she walked across my laptop

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,400
keyboard in such a way as to select and

00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,230
copy from a piece of source text this

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,720
being a complaint voiced by a friend of

00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,580
mine in a chat room and proceeded to

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,380
paste her selection back into the chats

00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,120
input field I will note that her work

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,660
even has a title

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,400
I found this unlikely and amazing and

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,889
evocative of the cut-up works of William

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,540
S Burroughs I knew that I needed to

00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:29,150
share it and I also knew that Twitter

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:32,960
did not present an adequate medium for

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,910
properly expressing this story last

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,790
December I did something very

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,190
ill-advised and foolish I wrote my own

00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,990
blogging engine which is stupid right

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,660
it's an egregious example of the not

00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,760
invented here fallacy made worse by my

00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,900
own decades of software experience which

00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,240
would suggest that I ought to know

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,520
better why would I waste my time and

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,720
talent when the world is filled with so

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,760
many great blogging services already

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,620
blurred is my back lettuce

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,389
my creating blurred was less about doing

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,220
more work less about reinventing the

00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:06,680
wheel than finally accepting what was

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,110
blocking me from writing my years long

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,729
acquiescence of canards against taking a

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,740
fresh look at established technology

00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:15,650
kept me away from long form writing

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:18,080
entirely but not for lack of trying see

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,639
I'm a live journal refugee LG is a great

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,950
system and still very much alive though

00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,870
its star has dimmed lot it was central

00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,349
to my social existence in the early to

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,310
mid 20s until Facebook stepped on it I

00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:30,070
never really took to Facebook for

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,139
reasons beyond the scope of this talk

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:35,060
but I did take to Twitter I love Twitter

00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:37,340
and by the start of the current decade

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,030
I've migrated to Twitter as my home this

00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,400
was great

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,440
I made new connections and expanded my

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,750
reach professionally there's a reason

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,639
that even today with this talk I use my

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,820
Twitter handle as my primary digital

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,430
identity pointer but just the same I had

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,630
all that stopped writing I mean yes over

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,120
the years I had learned a new writing

00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,669
craft which is writing tweet lengths

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,590
hyper summaries and that is a thing and

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:04,190
there is a time and a place for that but

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:07,580
I can we felt what I missed by walking

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:11,330
away from longer form writing I wanted

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:13,610
to get back in and I tried so many

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,830
things and even though all these

00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,889
platforms and others are great in their

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,750
own ways I still found myself unable to

00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:22,550
get back into regular blogging the

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,650
laziest solution would have involved

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,120
returning to my live journal and I still

00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,360
do use it but mostly to complain about

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,289
my family it fits that need very well in

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,059
fact it doesn't give

00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,979
much credit for it now but LJ was an

00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:35,539
early successful social network and

00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,550
sometimes I do want to write

00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:41,539
confessionals to friends and not public

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,129
essays alas LJ still feels a little long

00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:44,779
in the tooth not just in how much of my

00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:47,360
old friends list has moved on to other

00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,789
platforms but in its lack of support for

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,490
writing tools have come to rely on such

00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:54,770
as markdown the simpler simple writer

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,169
friendly text markup invented by John

00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,089
Gruber I fell in love with markdown

00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:00,680
while exploring other blog systems and

00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:04,189
while I could have written a custom

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,199
markdown to HTML to LJ client I'd really

00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:08,119
rather use a platform that felt more

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,039
like it had contemporary bloggers in

00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:12,619
mind like dreamwidth

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:14,419
right this seemed custom-made for me it

00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:16,339
supports markdown as long as you preface

00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:18,889
your posts with a shebang line of sorts

00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:20,569
and it has a built-in tool for importing

00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:22,430
all of your old live journal posts which

00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:25,610
is precisely what I did last summer and

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,139
then I proceeded to not use it again at

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,599
the time I chopped up my lack of motion

00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:31,430
to lose early laziness and my non desire

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,490
to use these free wonderful tools as

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,680
irrational at best with a benefit of

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,539
hindsight I now suspect I unwittingly

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,029
felt the tension between these platforms

00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:43,879
emphasis on friends lists and social

00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:46,909
networking with the fact that for good

00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:49,669
or ill I had a new social network and it

00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:51,169
fit me very well and no part of me

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,719
wanted to put the energy into properly

00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:56,199
cultivating a second one I just wanted a

00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:58,689
place to write and share my writing and

00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,519
this made tumblr strike out for me too

00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:03,409
with just as much personal frustration I

00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,419
think tumblr is great it's an

00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:06,769
impressively flexible system in fact if

00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,389
someone asked me where to start a new

00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:11,119
blog I'd have them look at tumblr first

00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:12,349
I host the blog of an annual event I

00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:14,749
organize there and I have no regrets

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:16,550
about that at all so make perfect sense

00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:18,860
for me totally my personal blog there

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,719
too but here too it just did not click I

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,379
find it telling that my last post from

00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:27,289
2012 involved a colleague reblogging me

00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,759
to use tumblers a term of art the moment

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:30,619
the platform's inescapable social

00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,449
networking fast it touched me I stopped

00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:34,849
using it though it would be years before

00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:36,620
I realized the connection and new

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,419
blogging platforms keep showing up bless

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,519
them like medium and I've no doubt that

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,839
more will follow but even I can see the

00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,729
foolishness and just waiting for someone

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,300
else to imagine you inevitably social

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,500
network he says

00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,130
him that I would somehow still like

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,959
after a week okay well if I didn't want

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,500
to use a service what does that leave me

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,779
with

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:58,190
why installing one of the vast array of

00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:59,630
DIY blogging engines of course I've had

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,730
reason to install and use either

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,230
WordPress or movable-type or a fork of

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,850
one or the other several times both for

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,760
myself and for others over the years and

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,230
they are behemoths in every case they're

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,720
less blogging systems than content

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,370
management engines they have a level

00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,779
complexity bordering on multiple user

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,760
fine-grain permissioned operating

00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:18,170
systems unto themselves when if he came

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,180
increasingly clear to me all I wanted

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,120
from a writing interface was something

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,649
more like this sometime in between my

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,360
engagement balance of DSL totally

00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:27,740
googling the phrase movable-type vs.

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,790
WordPress to see if the internet would

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,279
just tell me what to do already

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,529
I discovered octo press and friends this

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,480
was a revelation it's apparently based

00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:37,490
on a github technology called Jekyll and

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,920
I didn't know what that was and I didn't

00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,480
care about it what I did see was an easy

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,519
to install system that lets you write

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,040
markdown posts locally and it doesn't

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,170
care what tools you used to do so I love

00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,790
this and then you read some obscure Ruby

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,440
commands to regenerate your blog the

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,930
HTML files and then you push them all up

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,450
to your server with every edit I could

00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:59,420
work with this I used it for a couple of

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,589
years and I wrote 17 posts which is on

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,600
the one hand and even an improvement

00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:04,760
over my then recent record on the other

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,790
hand the system felt if not a bad fit

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,529
than a very near miss with those command

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,570
line indications I had to look up every

00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:14,329
time and the sense that I was somehow

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,250
using it wrong anyway and the fact that

00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:18,020
it was ultimately a system by a small

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,720
group of highly opinionated hackers

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:23,240
moving very quickly which I respect very

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,570
much it still made me feel like I was

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,370
borrowing someone else's typewriter I

00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:31,040
was lucky this past Christmas it was a

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,570
time of resetting for me I just a month

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,890
earlier shipped a client project that a

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,300
colleague and I had spent the last year

00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,190
working on as you can see by the

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,550
presence of a carousel it involved

00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,620
working with designers when I was a

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,940
younger freelancer I badger designers to

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,220
get on board with the same Bergeon

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,940
control system our mutual projects

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,350
codebase lived in today I do not do this

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,990
designers do not know or care about

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,720
version control as we do they do not

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,500
need to so for this project my team set

00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,120
up a shared drop

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,280
box folder which itself was a check out

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,410
of agate branch the designers do not

00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,510
care about it but everyone speaks drop

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,040
box and this let us collaborate

00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,380
relatively painlessly on a fairly

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,760
complicated web application this as we

00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,310
shall see would become pertinent in

00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,020
other ways I'd also just a month earlier

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,010
completed my first Turner's organizer of

00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,390
the annual interactive fiction

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,700
competition which involved in my

00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,650
throwing out thank you which involved my

00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,230
throwing out 15 years accumulation of

00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:26,000
PHP copy pasta and replacing it with a

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,450
catalyst application using a bootstrap

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,820
front-end a bootstrap is great by the

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:34,100
way I am a very strong believer in

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,140
ignoring all new technologies until this

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,210
the stress of your friends regard upon

00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,020
them become simply too great and that's

00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,030
what happened here

00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,040
I read the bootstrap documentation in

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:45,380
January 2014 and I've used it with every

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,290
fresh web project sense this too would

00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,120
become pertinent finally I just recently

00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,220
followed my partner to her new job in

00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,920
Newport Rhode Island after living for 14

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,960
years in Somerville Massachusetts

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,060
Newport is a great town you should visit

00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,730
it but you probably won't visit it in

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,860
winter because its population drops by a

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,780
third after Labor Day and then another

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,130
third after Christmas and then we

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,540
learned the fine line that exists

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,940
between a vacation retreat and the

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,950
middle of nowhere and you can only eat

00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,300
so many half-price offseason nachos at

00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,540
diego's before the sense of isolation

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,130
starts to really creep in mix these

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,690
together with the reflective period that

00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,400
comes naturally at the end of the year

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:26,240
and you start questioning received

00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:28,250
wisdom so I thought okay let's engage in

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,050
a thought experiment let's say I'm going

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,970
to allow myself to exist in a lawless

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,650
universe we're writing ones own blog

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,870
software is not a crime against both

00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:38,960
nature and good taste what would I want

00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,580
it to do well okay my fantasy would be

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,680
something like octopress only more so

00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,750
which is to say only less so which is to

00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,970
say I write and organize my entries as

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:50,830
markdown files on my own file system and

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:52,250
then a blog just happens over here

00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,800
somehow

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,210
well alright what technology you might

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,040
have recently used that allows one to

00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,870
make changes to a file in one computer

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,790
and have a completely different computer

00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:04,940
ones web server say immediately hear

00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:06,740
about it Dropbox is not our sink which

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,440
is what I used without a octo press it

00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,300
isn't get it is a foreign dependency

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,160
it's also at least for now

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,930
and subtle system that does just one

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,240
thing and does it exceedingly well I

00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,220
decided that I wanted to treat myself as

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,230
I had treated the designers from earlier

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,600
removing as much friction as I could

00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:26,060
between my creative tool and its outcome

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,340
on the web I also figured that someone

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:31,790
had surety are surely already built the

00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:34,700
system to the googles or its moral

00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:36,560
quilty I found a lot of blogging engines

00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,020
that all purport to use markdown and

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,820
Dropbox together and except for one I

00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,260
knew none of them would work for me I

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,970
spend an evening studying the results

00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,430
and I loved it because it really helped

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:49,520
me clarify everything I didn't want a

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:51,740
system supporting multiple users cool I

00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,080
I don't I don't want that a system has a

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,120
rich web based editing interface that

00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:00,020
sounds really good for someone I didn't

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:03,170
want that the exception was letterpress

00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,910
by Wang Ling it looked very good and it

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:07,940
had a philosophy that clearly jogged

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,680
with my own I want a minimal blogging

00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,890
system with a good writing experience

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,830
the creator wrote only static text files

00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:20,150
know HTML generated from a database no

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:22,670
RSS or atom no comments and no PHP well

00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,890
I wanted RSS but the rest of that

00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,720
sounded really good to me I wanted to

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,550
give it a shot but then I got to this

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,110
detail in the requirements I certainly

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,880
have no objection to running Python but

00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,160
the program's attachment to Python 3

00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,140
brought me up short I didn't have three

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,670
and I didn't want to learn about Python

00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,260
deployment management to install a cat

00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,330
poetry sharing engine I wasn't sure I

00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,340
wanted to use yet we're very

00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,590
well-meaning friends gestured at virtua

00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:49,940
n vice squinted into the distance and I

00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:51,800
saw only yaks hairy yaks it also gave me

00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,140
perspective to all the times I have said

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,500
oh just install Perl approval to others

00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:59,990
but that is its own story anyway I was

00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,510
done so what I did was I made a github

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:05,840
repo of my own let's talk about blurred

00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:07,760
blurred it's it's awful it's kind of a

00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,110
joke its readme thought MD is the first

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,270
the first thing I say in it is that you

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,070
should go use letterpress instead the

00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,300
expectation of blurred is this you have

00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,980
three directories at least one of which

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,540
lives on Dropbox in this case I put all

00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,950
three on Dropbox because I did this

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,720
before I knew how it would work and I

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,030
haven't corrected it yet it's it's all

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,860
good the source directory holds markdown

00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:26,720
files each file corresponds to

00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,820
exactly one blog post yes they are all

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,500
mashed into one directory this and the

00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,900
fact they all begin with dates are due

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,610
to an initial idea I had that since I

00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,690
don't care what time of day blog posts

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,430
are written clerk could let the

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,160
filesystem order and organize posts by

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,570
date by via dictionary sort it could get

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,130
the most recent post just by skimming

00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,710
the top of the directory by name

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:47,270
I wouldn't even mean need metadata I did

00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,980
research someone asked Stack Overflow

00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,300
how many times a directory could hold

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,920
how many files the director he could

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,810
hold before things started breaking down

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,700
and the official answer was yeah and

00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:00,590
that was good enough for me I added

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,720
metadata anyway you can't not have

00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,340
metadata but I do my best to minimize

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,710
how much the writer needs to care about

00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,210
a plort tourist file is just a markdown

00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,190
document which opens with a handful of

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,840
metadata lines in the key value format

00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,010
that I ripped off from October s and

00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,770
which has essentially become an ad-hoc

00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,270
markdown pseudo standard anyway the only

00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,040
required one is title because at this

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,900
time I don't care about categories or

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,370
tags or anything plort itself adds to

00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,410
the timestamp on publication which will

00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,790
come back to returning to the file

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,770
system we have the templates folder

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,270
which contains some utterly unsurprising

00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,580
template toolkit files these are

00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,440
templates that define what a posts or a

00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,170
list of post looks like as HTML how the

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,600
RSS XML document is generated what the

00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,190
single archive page looks like yes there

00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,180
is only a single archive page on the

00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,470
theory that if it's good enough for

00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,620
daring fire of all this too is good

00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,810
enough for me Willis Gale I decided I

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,560
did not care even if this blog became a

00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,960
raging success

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,610
I really don't write electrically I knew

00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,310
I would not hit practical scaling issues

00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,560
for years if ever I decided that my need

00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,940
to write today trump the desires of a

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,960
hypothetical future reader for a

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,960
multiple page archive

00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:08,710
anyway the third pleure directory is the

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,910
doc root which is plorts output ready

00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:12,250
for feeding to the web server of your

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,020
choice plorts core process is a demon

00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,460
called blurred watcher and every time it

00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,110
sees a change in that source directory

00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,480
tree publishes the whole thing as needed

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,620
patriot post the RSS the archive and a

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,900
front page with the ten most recent

00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,180
posts which in my blogs k case looks

00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,250
like this perhaps you recognize this as

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,900
vanilla bootstrap it is a bit bland but

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,970
by using bootstrap in my templates I do

00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,590
get a lot for free including a lovely

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,310
mobile-friendly output by way of

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,080
responsive design

00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,280
maybe someday I'll punch it up for

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,440
further with my own choice of font

00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,330
rather than bootstrap default Helvetica

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,330
or other customizations but for now I've

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:45,220
been too busy writing since relaunching

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,960
my essay blog with blurred less than six

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,520
months ago I've written and published

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,950
tens of thousands of words across dozens

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,500
of posts I would humbly not imply that

00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,270
any are actually worth reading but I can

00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,650
state as objective truth that few

00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,450
perhaps none would exist

00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,370
had I not finally accepted that I

00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:03,310
couldn't work with the world's extant

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,200
blogging tools so here's my workflow for

00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,880
blogging now I whale away on a markdown

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,800
file in a text editor while using an

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,500
excellent Mac application called marked

00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,330
by Brett terpstra to keep a running

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,190
preview of how it would look as HTML

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,930
until I'm ready to publish it the file

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,390
lives in a local directory outside of

00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,370
Dropbox or and keep all my drafts when I

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,290
am all done I move the file which can be

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:26,170
named anything so long as it ends in dot

00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:28,330
markdown or AMD into plort source folder

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,190
Dropbox automatically syncs the file to

00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,750
my web server third watch recedes to the

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,640
change and immediately starts updating

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,530
the dock route because the site is made

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,420
entirely of static HTML can take as long

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,490
as it needs to update all the HTML and

00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,590
xml files one at a time and it doesn't

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,960
break the site so that's me dodging the

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,700
scaling question again when you publish

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,200
a post plort has its way rid of it

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,110
adding more metadata such as that

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,180
timestamp if you use a text to where a

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,860
change aware text editor like BBEdit

00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,960
you'll see this immediately in your open

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,300
document per the very first of anil

00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,160
Dash's 15 lessons from 15 years of

00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,800
blogging an excellent post y'all should

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,600
read by the way typos in posts do not

00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,490
reveal themselves until you've published

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,080
and I know that only publication

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,790
motivates me to make a hundred little

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,650
tweaks to my post under pressure of

00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:14,740
knowing that until I do all of its flaws

00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,630
Lee exposed to the world with blurred

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,680
every time you hit save on your local

00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,390
text editor drop off

00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,010
propagates the change to your server and

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,990
then it's flirt watcher daemon sees that

00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,540
and rebuilds your blog's doc route all

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,190
invisibly to you the writer there is no

00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,260
separate publish action to say nothing

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,610
of a republish action and I personally

00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:34,600
find this to be my single favorite

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:36,460
aspect of the system Dash's sixth lesson

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,740
your blog can change your life in a

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,060
month speaks of the value of blogging to

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,910
the writer that the act of writing

00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:45,070
regularly and in public encourages one

00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:47,200
of a writer Lee Benz to think more

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,370
deeply about the culture around them by

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,920
meeting the challenge of writing

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,930
something worth reading I agree

00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,850
and I've also found that the additional

00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:57,160
challenge of coming back again and again

00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,680
has resulted in my exploring culture

00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,930
more widely as well everything from the

00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,570
first half of my talk came from my last

00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,920
six months vlogging not only have I been

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,470
writing words I wouldn't have written

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,270
otherwise but I've been reading watching

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,830
and playing a lot of source material

00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,710
that I would have otherwise overlooked I

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:17,530
recognize now that blogging acts both as

00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:20,080
the record of and the motivation for my

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,570
own continuing cultural explorations and

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,270
for me all this comes after years of

00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,220
resistance to reinventing a wheel it can

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:29,800
be hard especially after long experience

00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,810
to see when an exception against a

00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,150
general perhaps sacred rule of the craft

00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:35,740
applies to your work but I would

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,900
encourage you to always keep it as an

00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,180
option because sometimes it might just

00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,670
be better for your health enjoy your

00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:46,420
lunch thank you very much
