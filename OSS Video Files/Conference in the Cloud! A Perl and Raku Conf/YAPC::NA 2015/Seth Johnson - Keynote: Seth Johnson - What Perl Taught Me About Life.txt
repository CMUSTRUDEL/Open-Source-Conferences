a machine or using the human machine the

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,879
process is the same you need to

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,090
understand the problem or the objective

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,400
that you're trying to achieve and if you

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,290
don't you're not likely to be set very

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,960
successful in that the difference is

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,460
that when you are doing research and

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,230
information gathering for things like

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,539
social engineering you're much more

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,820
likely to go through the trash then you

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,000
are to go through a lot of other things

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,890
because people are often very careless

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,539
in addition to that there's planning of

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,219
course once you understand your

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,620
objective you understand the problem

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,780
it's nice to go ahead and put together a

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,820
plan of how you would like to achieve

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:44,430
your objective how you want to attack

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:54,989
the problem next is a video of using a

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:56,430
plan lets the Bollywood us I hate to

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:01,949
imagine what the rest of your plan was

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:03,989
how did you get in far less effective on

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,479
a second-floor landing I have an alarm

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,920
you do and your code is your birthday

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,150
you might as well take all your

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,729
valuables and put them right out on the

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:17,070
lawn anyway so I think it's important to

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,420
have a plan not only if you're trying to

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,700
achieve these kind of objectives with

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,580
other individuals but also to have a

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,439
plan with the the way that you would

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,299
like to not be social engineered by

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,310
other people the next one is the

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,590
approach when you are approaching

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,840
someone to perform some kind of social

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,680
engineering or someone approaches you

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,070
you want to make sure that you don't

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,869
ruin your plan by giving anything away

00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,579
and then the delivery making sure that

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,290
you follow your plan but also have a

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,140
plan that's adaptable enough that you

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,640
can kind of work on the fly and change

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,329
things around to meet the needs that you

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,939
have and lastly extrication getting out

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:56,189
preferably without setting off any

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,469
alarms or red flags and then I have

00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,969
another video to show a quick example of

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,050
this some of you may have seen this film

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:08,390
Oh your hair drastic he has a table

00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:10,700
to himself relax you're late all right

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,200

00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,370
look look out the window my partners are

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,370
walking into the car as we speak look

00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,870
old guy almost pissed in his pants when

00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,130
I came through the door he jumped right

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,840
to move into under the hood of my car

00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:04,040
and murph yeah call the LAPD again I

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,690
don't want people walking through my

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:11,530
crime scene I didn't expect this isn't

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:22,280
service on this don't worry about it

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:26,090
what's your name and ready cow mind if I

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:30,400
see some identification never can be too

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:32,300
careful these days well tough luck call

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,680
five minutes earlier you would have

00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,080
landed yourself a pretty good collar

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,410
sorry ten seconds late and you'd have

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,660
been shot mind if I come downstairs with

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,640
you I gotta take a look at this guy sure

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,750
thing just do me a favor and sit tight

00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,310
for a second while I get this evidence

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,530
downstairs you know I don't want some

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,660
made walking through here and making the

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,660
bed LAPD should be here any sec great

00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,310
you want

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:07,510
you hang on to it for a minute I trust

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:10,900
you so that's some pretty incredible

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:15,100
delivery and obviously some talented

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:18,760
acting as well but being able to adapt

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:21,010
and observe on the fly he was able to

00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,990
understand that one of the normal things

00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,540
that law enforcement officers would do

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,120
to one another is ask for identification

00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,890
so he used that actively in that kind of

00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,120
thing so there are a number of things

00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,760
that are part of the the different

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,960
components of social engineering one is

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,450
preloading getting the conversation

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,200
ready before it even starts this is very

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:43,180
common in advertising some of the the

00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,330
things that you might see and perhaps a

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,580
commercial for drinks is people are

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,590
always partying I don't know if you're

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,180
aware of this but just opening a drink

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,280
doesn't start a party at your house or

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,050
invite your friends over but that

00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,260
preloads the conversation almost every

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,970
time you see one of those advertisements

00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,460
the next is pretexting it and that is

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,650
the assumption of a rule which may or

00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,630
may not be deceptive in this particular

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,700
video that you just saw it certainly was

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,300
but you can also protect something that

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,250
you are elicitation is drawing answers

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,560
out from people sometimes that's asking

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,240
a direct question like I can ask Russell

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,320
Fisher why in the world do you like

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,790
doing the wave at Yap see or I could say

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,520
hey Russell I noticed that you did the

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,919
wave at Yap see yesterday and let him

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,240
take it from there I think that probably

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,710
both of those things would be very

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,290
effective to get some information out of

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,120
him sometimes you have to choose the

00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,800
right method for you the next one is

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,390
framing each one of us as a human being

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,200
has our own frame of reference or own

00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:46,900
worldview and do things are different

00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,000
than they are for other people we also

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,230
have little sub views of different

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,930
things the way that we deal with certain

00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,720
situations is common to us but not

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,800
necessarily come to other people

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,210
understanding how someone frames their

00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,590
own environment or being able to bring

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,830
someone into a particular frame that

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,350
they already possess is very valuable

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:08,080
the next component is report which is

00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,220
like your how much your liked how

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,970
likable you are how many of you are

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,970
liking me right now

00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:19,240
okay a couple and we can try to improve

00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,530
that if you're likable people are much

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,480
more likely to do what you would like

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,340
them to do and you're much more likely

00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,520
to do things for people that you like

00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,380
it's just the way we work next is

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,940
observation and listening if you listen

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,760
very carefully to whether people say and

00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,290
what watch what they act you're far more

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,690
likely to understand how you need to

00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,450
interact with them and then the last one

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:42,730
of course is influenced you need to be

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,860
able to use some kind of influence on

00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,900
someone as part of social engineering

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,060
whether it is getting them to perform a

00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,010
particular action or getting them to not

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,570
perform a particular action or getting

00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,270
them to believe in a particular way or

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:59,470
changes our opinion in some circumstance

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:01,510
that is you culminating the social part

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,310
of the influence and sometimes this is

00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,630
manipulation for you know nefarious

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,790
purposes and sometimes it's used for

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,080
good things social engineering is used

00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,390
in a lot of different ways and we all

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,900
use it pretty much every day we just

00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,310
don't think of it in that particular way

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,250
now as far as talking about instruction

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,440
sets the human machine is a little bit

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,870
more complex than say the Pearl compiler

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,940
in that we require a little bit

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,530
different motivation in Pearl you just

00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:31,060
tell the compiler what you would like it

00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:34,060
to do and it does it in asking a human

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,430
to do something say make me a sandwich

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,840
it's not very likely to happen unless

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,760
you have a really good reason so what

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,720
are the reasons that we do things the

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,430
first of course is authority I like to

00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,870
liken this to the you're not the boss of

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,170
me from elementary school how many of

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:52,870
you use that all the time right my kids

00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,190
say that you're not the boss of me it

00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,410
turns out that when someone is the boss

00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,820
of you or threatens to tell the boss of

00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,250
you you're far more likely to do

00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,660
something that they want the next one is

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:06,610
avoidance and I've got a short clip

00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:09,940
about that yeah who's this what this is

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:12,390
mallorie oh is this your friend from

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,390
work

00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:31,800
uh what was that do you guys have some

00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:33,930
sort of history or were you dating or

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:38,130
were you dating when we started dating

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:57,240
no don't lie to me well I'm not isn't

00:08:38,130 --> 00:09:01,079
just all right so I think you'll find

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,120
that we're very likely to use avoidance

00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:04,829
as a strategy we're likely to try and

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,320
avoid certain situations that are

00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:11,089
uncomfortable for us and that motivates

00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:15,000
us to do things the next one is the

00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:17,339
commitment you might not be able to read

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,720
that this is a father who wrote 826

00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,610
notes to his daughter after he was

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,709
diagnosed with cancer as part of the

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,050
Twitter campaign for the because I said

00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:30,000
I would movement how many of you heard

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:32,279
of the movement nobody okay it's it's a

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,110
fantastic movement I think that having

00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,300
the integrity to follow through with

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,550
this is an interesting thing this

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,079
particular motivation strategy works

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,029
very well with me in case you were

00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,680
wondering my children use it on a

00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:45,209
regular basis telling me dad you

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,389
promised you would read two stories

00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:52,279
tonight instead of one okay I'll read

00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:55,440
two stories I will do it the next one is

00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:57,870
consistency I don't know if you know how

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,089
long ago Aristotle wrote the we are what

00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:05,220
we repeatedly do excellence therefore is

00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:07,139
in is a habit instead of an act a long

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,110
long time ago humans have been doing

00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:12,839
this idea of being consistent and

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,399
following through and repetitive it's a

00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,949
motivation for us because we believe

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,720
that that leads to excellence the next

00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:22,470
one this one's for you Cora your cat

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,319
picture when you surrender something

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,199
when you concede something to someone

00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:28,980
you're more likely to concede again this

00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:31,440
happens is for

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,260
during events and it happens whenever

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,000
you can see something to someone else

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,440
oftentimes we find out that we're in a

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,699
position where we don't have very much

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:45,029
to bargain with the next one is fear a

00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:47,459
little bit of an inside joke here for

00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:49,949
all of you who viens we do things out of

00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:53,639
fear very often sometimes we're afraid

00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:55,500
of looking bad maybe I'm afraid of you

00:10:53,639 --> 00:11:00,630
know nobody laughing at any of my jokes

00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:03,420
today but it's a motivator for us also

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,980
greed how many of you would work ten

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:09,980
percent harder for ten percent more

00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:16,110
salary I'd probably try I'll be honest

00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:17,190
what's that depends on which part of the

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,750
temper saying you're looking for right

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,990
how about just ten percent more salary

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:24,540
in general all right and then the next

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:28,860
one is merit or your rights you deserve

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,839
this you deserve this brand new car how

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,120
many of you heard that in ads all the

00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,519
time do you really deserve it I don't

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,970
know that's kind of a tenable situation

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,380
their momentum we tend to like to do the

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,730
same things that we've always done how

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,930
many of you park in the same parking

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:47,670
spot at work every day you guys are

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:53,569
liars if you're not raising your hand in

00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:57,029
the same spot okay you're pashto

00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:58,949
obligation I don't even know what deck

00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:00,149
this is from the night of obligation but

00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:01,800
we do things because we're obliged to

00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:05,370
sometimes because we're legally obliged

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,569
to or morally obliged to okay Magic the

00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:11,190
Gathering Thank You those of you who

00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:12,930
play Magic the Gathering reciprocation

00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:16,190
if I do something for you you're far

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:19,170
more likely to do something for me and

00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,639
then this one's scarcity I don't know if

00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,769
you guys have seen this on amazon i

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:27,600
looked it up yesterday there are two

00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:30,089
purl cookbooks left in stock you should

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,310
order soon that might not be the only

00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:34,649
motivating factor for you to purchase a

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:37,019
great book the Pearl cookbook second

00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:38,130
edition but if you're on the fence and

00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,029
you realize there are only two left in

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:41,360
stock how many of you will buy that

00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:41,360
thing

00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:49,530
yeah probably Vincent go away me wait

00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,470
you're trapped by societal convention

00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,820
look we're to fine dining environment

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,650
everyone knows not to throw a scene in a

00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,490
fancy restaurant that's right you're

00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:02,550
trapped sit out oh shoot I see we're

00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:06,690
trapped by societal convention so

00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:08,310
oftentimes we're also bound by social

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,340
norms or the pressures that are on us

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,170
for the things that we do we do what

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,150
other people do and you would think Oh

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,130
Seth you're just showing me a Disney

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:24,060
video of Phineas and Ferb that doesn't

00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:26,750
happen in real life well yes it does the

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,580
gentleman in the elevator now is a

00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,260
candid stop these folks who are entering

00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,050
the man with the white shirt the lady

00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,140
with the trench coat and subsequently

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:42,270
one other member of our staff will face

00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:44,360
the rear and you'll see how this man in

00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,360
the

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,230
to maintain his individuality

00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,360
little by little

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,130
it looks at his watch but he's really

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:11,350
making an excuse for turning just a

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:14,440
little bit more to the wall I would try

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:17,320
it once again here's the cannon subject

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:21,779
here comes the candid camera staff three

00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:25,589
of them at least and this man has

00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:25,589
apparently been in group

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,600
alright we're going to cut that a little

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,890
bit short so we can make time they

00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,900
actually did a couple more experience

00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,970
from where they had people taking their

00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,470
hats off and turning to the side and

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,060
then turning back and people would

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,230
follow it all the way through you

00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,460
wouldn't believe the kinds of things you

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,870
will do because other people have done

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,300
them but to wrap it up let's talk a

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,700
little bit about the story time so for

00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,230
the reward system situation that I that

00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,270
I talked to you about I call it this

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,650
company because I wanted them to return

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,300
ownership of this particular account

00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,250
that I had access to to someone else I

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,080
called up and I said look I'm trying to

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,820
make things better I know that I'm not

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,190
the rightful owner of this I'd like you

00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,720
to transfer to someone else here you go

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,670
this is the person that it belongs to

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,050
the person on the phone said I'll go

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,480
talk to my supervisor cleared with the

00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,529
supervisor and transferred it away the

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,500
world is a better place although

00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,910
probably not safer because of that there

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,380
was no real validation that occurred

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:30,460
there so I could have just transferred

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:32,980
it in a different direction but okay as

00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,410
far as the experience in the home

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,870
improvement store I was very flustered

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,880
it was very awkward to be the guy who

00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,670
someone shouted out and said you you

00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,580
shot that man there was blood everywhere

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:48,370
I didn't actually do that and I

00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:52,180
vehemently denied it but it also made me

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:55,540
make my purchase quite fast in the case

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:58,209
of the pushpins every person that I'm

00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:00,940
presented that to took one I didn't have

00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:02,770
to say a word there were several people

00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,089
who said why are you giving me this and

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,529
I said I didn't give you anything I just

00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,959
hold it out there there were several

00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:10,150
people who said why do I have this and

00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:13,660
the the process jumped all the way

00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:15,279
through to the what's going on and then

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,190
lastly they do not move thanks

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,589
management sign stood in the hallway for

00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,660
six months we actually moved it in front

00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:24,760
of the boss's office for a couple of

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,770
weeks to the point where she had to like

00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,170
waddle around it to get into her office

00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:31,690
every single day not once did she think

00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:33,810
I'm the management how does this even

00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,810
happen

00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:40,500
so while you're using social engineering

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,600
in your life I'd like to suggest a

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,800
couple of things as far as ethics you

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,910
should think carefully social

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,010
engineering is something that we do

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,120
every day you do to me I do it to you

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,910
you do it to your families and friends

00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,140
and it's not necessarily bad but it can

00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,520
be bad so I want you to think carefully

00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,630
about it and think carefully about the

00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:58,050
way that people are trying to interact

00:16:54,630 --> 00:17:00,150
with you we all deserve better all of us

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,040
deserve something that is different than

00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,360
what we've got right now I want you to

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,640
avoid the traps that you could

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,380
potentially fall into and help other

00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,870
people avoid traps as well and tell them

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,600
how this is supposed to work I want to

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:14,670
help you to improve your lives in your

00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,079
communication i want you to be able to

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,610
make a difference in your own lives and

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,470
lives of other people but it is your

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:21,329
responsibility I can't make this

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,189
decision for you I can't make your

00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,660
situation better I can't help you to

00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:25,829
understand social engineering more than

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,199
just get up here and talk about it and

00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,570
there are not enough people helping so I

00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,270
need some people to help will you do me

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,580
a favor or do yourself a favor will you

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,410
help me how many of you will help me by

00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:42,810
using social engineering for good causes

00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:45,450
