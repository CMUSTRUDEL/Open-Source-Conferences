waiting for Tim's talk i'm just going to

00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:55,299
tell you about failure so some really

00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:57,459
super fast introductions um for those of

00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:59,079

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,769
those so the obligatory slide that does

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,239
does not actually apply to me I don't

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:45,669
get to say that right now because I get

00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:48,040
to say this instead ok so if you happen

00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:50,440
to be looking for some kick ass upper or

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,419
middle technical management and you

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,349
don't mind that I am going to stay in

00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:59,139
portland oregon we should probably talk

00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:02,019
so um before we get into some contact i

00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:04,659
have a prologue unless you've been

00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:06,459
living under a rock here at yap see you

00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:09,220
know that gene heck is going through

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:14,099
surgery today why did that not go there

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:19,120
it goes oh it's not playing did it okay

00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:22,930
well I screwed up oh I know why there we

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,200
go it's it's not playing on mine anyway

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,520
so um John is actually the third person

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,350
in my life this year to have to be

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,090
dealing with cancer

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,300
the most important one to me is my

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,370
mother so now that you have foolishly

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,050
prove that you are already engaged I'd

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,670
like a little audience participation on

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,890
the count of three I'd like everyone to

00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:49,150
give a great big shout of dammit cancer

00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:53,440
hey one two three damn it cancer ooh got

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,730
chills that was really good so John our

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,560
thoughts are with you we're looking

00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:05,410
forward to seeing you next year but your

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:06,520
kidney is not invited so um why in the

00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:10,000
hell am i up here talking you about

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,790
failure anyway oh well I'd say three or

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,250
so years ago I was working on a great

00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:18,250
big long writing project and the course

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,380
of that project I got wondering well why

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,850
do things fail what a companies fail

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,340
what a projects fail what a products

00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,800
fail and I kind of fell down the rabbit

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,710
hole because I found myself doing over

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,570
eleven hundred pages of research since

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,180
then failure has become a hobby of mine

00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:36,490
I kind of Jack that number up well

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,550
beyond 2000 I just keep reading and

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:42,550
learning a lot more about failure so

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:46,870
what this presentation is is a synopsis

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:49,360
of those two thousand plus pages because

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,450
it is a synopsis what you're going to

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,160
find is that your mileage may vary every

00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,450
single project it's different every

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,250
single company is different every single

00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,930
organization has different needs so what

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,420
I'm going to cover here are the points

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,180
which through my research is this thread

00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:08,680
of commonality throughout almost all of

00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:10,630
the failure that i have studied so when

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,840
you ask me specific questions in the QA

00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:18,820
QA please expect me to answer with well

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,980
it depends on that note there is plenty

00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,170
of time for questions at the end so

00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:27,710
please save them and ND come any

00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:30,650
comments until then coffee

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:35,600
oh let me see ooh two more slides in

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:36,650
this little prologue this is one of my

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,080
favorite subjects i get a little

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,480
impassioned about it some of that

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,660
passion finds its way out in four letter

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,850
words I will try to keep it to a minimum

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,260
apologies in advance if I fail I am NOT

00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:52,240
saying that I swear a lot but I am

00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,240
saying that this man is my patronus

00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:59,540
alright so prologue is done let's get

00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:05,630
into some examples of dramatic failures

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:09,710
in modern times March 28 1979 how many

00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:12,320
of you were alive then wow it's really

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,720
rare I get that many hands at a talk at

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,870
this talk um so there was a stuck valve

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,570
an ambiguous signal light and a lack of

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,100
training that led to a meltdown at Three

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,290
Mile Island and it is the largest

00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,490
nuclear disaster that America has faced

00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,490
yet and one the largest in the world

00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,830
january twenty eighth nineteen

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,030
eighty-six the engineer said hey we

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,760
think there's a problem with the o2

00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:39,650
tanks manager said don't worry that's

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,490
only going to be a problem if certain

00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,690
things occur so we're going to go forth

00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,430
unfortunately those certain things

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,920
occurred and the space shuttle

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:53,980
Challenger exploded on liftoff killing

00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:59,030
everyone aboard much much more recent

00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:01,040
April twentieth 2010 some workers were

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,370
fault incorrectly following a cementing

00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,480
procedure and this led to escaping gas

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,860
there was welding nearby and normally

00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,920
this is in the problem but unfortunately

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,840
this was happening on a windless day we

00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,140
all know what happened but the specific

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,510
grim numbers are 11 killed 16 injured

00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,610
and the largest environmental disaster

00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:23,590
that our country has thus far experience

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:27,050
and hopefully will ever experience so

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:29,900
when the many many things that all of

00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,520
these colossal disasters failures have

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,180
in common is that they occurred in

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,820
complex systems but really what we need

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,040
to remember going forward is that

00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,310
everything is a complex system and if

00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,279
you

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:46,100
believe me just think about making

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:50,060
cookies try to list every single

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,880
variable involved in making cookies that

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,950
is an incredibly complex system and that

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,130
is nothing near as complex it's what we

00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,020
do day to day in our jobs complexity is

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:06,140
all around us and therefore so is

00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:08,270
failure so let me throw some numbers at

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,660
you my original research was done in the

00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:14,570
context of business specifically

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:17,529
technical startups so most of these

00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,520
statistics are business related but

00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,730
similar ones I have found in my

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:27,230
subsequent research occur in just about

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:31,600
every field so it while they are

00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,600
business related they're not a typical

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:37,970
every single year ten percent of

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,970
American companies disappear the failure

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:43,700
rate among new businesses may be over

00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,140
ninety percent within the first five

00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,630
years of launch eighty percent of

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,670
businesses will fail within the next

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,600
five years eighty percent of those

00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:56,420
survivors will be gone these are only a

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,980
few examples yet even these show just

00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,050
how prevalent failure is it is

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,760
absolutely everywhere making it one of

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:06,290
our most abundant natural resources so

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,270
if it's so abundant why shouldn't we

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,800
make better use of it hey we should

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:13,670
embrace the incredible learning

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,339
potential of failure we all fail it's

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:18,470
just a fact of existence every single

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:22,130
failure provides data we can use to

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:25,520
prevent or minimize the next one failure

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:28,760
is an effective teacher teaches you what

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,830
doesn't work and when you're out there

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,390
on the frontier it provides invaluable

00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,380
information that allows you to keep

00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:37,700
pushing further into the oven unknown

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,830
one thing we need to remember through

00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,459
all this is that while experiences

00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,930
automatic learning is not therefore we

00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:49,070
must always be on the lookout for

00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:51,620
failures Tim Hartford has this amazing

00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,590
book it's called adapt why success

00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,110
always starts with failure

00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:58,060
and this is a great quote from that make

00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:01,840
sure you know when you've failed or you

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:03,490
will never learn if you do it correctly

00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,230
that failure is going to provide

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,810
relatively cheap data from which you can

00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:11,860
learn not learning from that data is a

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:15,220
deadly mistake but despite that most

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:18,340
failures will go unreported unreported

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,380
failures have immense costs not only in

00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,690
money which is the most obvious one but

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:27,490
also an effort morale goodwill and the

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:29,170
most precious of all things time so

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,140
considering the high costs involved and

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,860
the incredible teaching potential

00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:39,760
locating failure should be as well

00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:41,290
rewarded as locating successes so no

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,120
amount of time or money is going to

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,060
materialize a success out of a failure

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,040
hat right constant vigilance for and

00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,050
reporting of failures will enable you to

00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,320
fail early before those aforementioned

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:55,240
costs start racking up also it allows

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,680
you to fail early so you can kill and

00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,870
undertaken before it becomes a zombie

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,820
project zombie projects just shamble

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:04,860
along and they eat the brains time and

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,860
goodwill of everyone who encounters them

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,330
vigilance and reporting of failures also

00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,250
allows you the opportunity to use trial

00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:15,550
and error rather than just being stuck

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:20,650
in error mode accepting trial and error

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:22,720
means accepting error you don't always

00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,570
have to get it right the first time but

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,250
you do have to know what went wrong once

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,720
we accept that failure happens this will

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,360
enable us to have more than just a plan

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:36,130
a and that means we can have handy

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,690
little things like an exit strategy very

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,270
useful to remember when speaking about

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:43,480
failure that failure is absolutely vital

00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:46,240
part of evolution evolution itself is

00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:52,600
just a constant series of works for now

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:56,500
solutions as solutions evolve so do

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,690
problems stay the course equals a lack

00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,730
of adaptability the problem will evolve

00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:02,620
but the solution does not in a nature

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:06,620
and and many other things this can be a

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:09,230
very bad thing so I

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,430
by now kind of beaten this enough and

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,550
you got in the point that failure can be

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:16,760
valuable so I'm going to talk about some

00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:18,830
of the causes of failure there are very

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,010
very many but they fall more or less

00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:25,760
into two very large categories the first

00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:29,020
one is culture in a culture which is

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,640
hostile to failure mistakes are hidden

00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,710
rather than those people face the wrath

00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,360
of their peers and people will avoid

00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,540
association with failure rather than

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,770
accept responsibility therefore they

00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:46,730
become overly cautious and risk-averse I

00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:48,890
 love this one under performance

00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:52,280
will not be reported and as you expect

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:57,140
this can be costly this one reminds me

00:13:52,280 --> 00:14:00,170
of Larry's dryer heck Oh initial failure

00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:02,450
can be bad but these steps to cover it

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:06,890
usually are worse have a couple of

00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:09,170
examples let's say you're a gambler so

00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:10,580
you make one bad bet don't worry I'll

00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:12,500
make it back the next time and then you

00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,760
don't make it back because you have to

00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,320
make another bet you have to make

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,090
another bet and it becomes a really bad

00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,560
cycle the things you're doing to cover

00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,140
the initial failure end up worse than

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:27,260
the original one another really good

00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:30,430
example of this are payday loans so

00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:35,180
really we're all human beings I think

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:37,520
pretty sure so it's really no surprise

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:43,430
to any of us that humans don't like to

00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:45,590
fail but we do really like to blame we

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:49,330
love handing out blame the urge to point

00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:51,350
fingers is intensely strong in cultured

00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,580
we like to point the fingers but we

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,760
don't like to be on the receiving end of

00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:58,220
it and because of that we fear failure

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,650
and blame and we stop asking the

00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,320
questions which might reveal it to avoid

00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:06,230
blame people remain silent and many

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:11,170
failures go unreported am I the only

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:14,980
person who gets this joke oh thank you

00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:18,980
alright there's three of us my tribe

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:20,870
okay so that was a really high level of

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,470
the first category of causes of failure

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:28,070
the second one our cognitive biases so

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,390
our brains have a lot of hard coded old

00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,650
behaviors which evolved when we were

00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,600
living in trees and running from

00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:35,510
predators back then we call these things

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,100
reasonable in modern and more

00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:40,820
enlightened times we call them cognitive

00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,370
biases psychologists have catalogued and

00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,110
immense number of these but there are a

00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,240
few which seemed to come up over and

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,190
over again in my failure about research

00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,540
I'm going to summarize these greatest

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,150
hits but if you want to learn more about

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:56,870
all of them this thing right here is a

00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:58,280
fascinating read so let's get into those

00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,990
greatest hits shall we and I'm going to

00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:04,760
start with my favorite cognitive bias

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:06,650
which is normalization of deviance how

00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,380
many times have you been tailing a log

00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,420
and you see this exception that just

00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:15,740
keeps coming up and coming up and coming

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:17,690
up but it's okay no problem the service

00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,390
is still running everything's fine what

00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,730
you have just done is spotted some

00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,650
Vivian's and normalized you're ignoring

00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:29,270
it yeah it's not causing any problems

00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:30,890
right now but it will someday another

00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,480
brilliant example of this if you've

00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,220
never tailed a log because I know a lot

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:42,080
of people haven't is the check engine

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:45,380
light in your car so next cognitive bias

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,330
is outcome bias so when you have a

00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,250
project and the end result a success

00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,280
naturally the entire process was

00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,710
successful wasn't it no no you're

00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,530
ignoring the idea of complex systems

00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,870
they were failures along the way but if

00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:02,870
you don't study the entire process

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,970
you're never going to see them so if you

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,260
only study the things which are failures

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,079
you're going to miss a lot of

00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,780
information the opposite side of that

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,270
coin is survival bias if you only study

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,920
the things which are successes you're

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:20,179
going to miss a lot of information and a

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:24,630
lot of failures and the last one which

00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:27,970
is most common is illusion of control

00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:31,420
we as human beings are typically

00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:35,170
intensely arrogant we like to believe we

00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:38,890
have control over all factors and sorry

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:40,630
people but we don't this illusion of

00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:44,170
control it leads to an inability to

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:46,450
separate chance from skill so that's

00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,490
like the greatest hits of cognitive

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,330
biases that seem to come up in almost

00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:54,670
every single research study on failure

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:56,410
now that we can kind of maybe recognize

00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,970
some of these causes i'm going to start

00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:01,810
we're talking about how we can work

00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:04,210
around these causes and you then prevent

00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:06,160
minimize or learn from failing I'm going

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:11,290
to do that by starting with an old dead

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:14,080
Russian dude Peter pouch in ski pal

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:17,530
chance key was a an engineer in Russia

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,660
in the early 1900s and the powers who

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:22,120
are in Russia came to him and say hey

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:24,550
Pete we've got some problems at some

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,930
mines in Siberia would you mind going up

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,040
there having a look and coming back and

00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,380
telling us what we can do to improve

00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:33,940
situation and Pete's like sure man I'd

00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:36,970
love to do that so Pete went up had a

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:40,330
look came back with a report and the

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,310
cheeky bastard told the powers who are

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,570
what they needed to hear rather than

00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,340
what they wanted to hear and he was

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,850
unfortunately eventually disappeared for

00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,590
it so cognitive biases hadn't been

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,630
labeled by then but he still intuitively

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,730
understood them he came up with a list

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,100
of three principles which would help to

00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:59,920
avoid cognitive biases and reduce the

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:03,490
chances and or impact of failure these

00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,860
are the pouch in ski principles seek out

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:08,800
and try new things when trying something

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:12,100
new make it survivable seek out feedback

00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:15,040
and learn from it so I don't know if any

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,260
of you recognize this but this old

00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,610
Russian engineer invented iterative

00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:24,190
development work in small chunks make it

00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,680
survivable try something new get

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:31,110
feedback from your users this minimizes

00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,110
the impact and possibility of failure

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:39,690
so let's kind of dive into a few really

00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:42,169
high-level solutions to fixing failure

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,360
problems and the acceptance of failure

00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:48,480
the most important one is to shift the

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:52,380
culture it is also by the way the

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,029
hardest one one way to do that is going

00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:58,559
to be reducing the stigma failure within

00:19:54,029 --> 00:20:00,690
your organization let people know that

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,539
it is absolutely okay to make mistakes

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,130
it's natural to do it it's okay to do it

00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:09,000
you're not going to get your ass kicked

00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:11,370
if you make mistakes therefore don't

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,070
punish people for making mistakes if you

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:17,070
must punish only do it in cases of

00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:21,679
absolute gross negligence or repeated in

00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:23,909
competence don't do it just for mistakes

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,149
what this is going to foster within your

00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:29,010
organization is a tolerance and having

00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:31,590
that tolerance which will in eight it

00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,960
will enable you to have an analysis of

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,970
your failures of these mistakes that

00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,700
people bring up that analysis will

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:43,020
foster learning it's a lovely little

00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:44,789
system that feeds itself another thing

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,559
you can do is reward that analysis

00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:52,320
reward thoughtful reflection and

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:55,159
introspection into a problem we also

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,870
need to discourage analysis free blame

00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:03,210
one of the favorite absolute favorite

00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:05,899
pieces of research I read some

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:09,179
researchers at some University somewhere

00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:11,279
went to a ton of CEOs they were several

00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:14,220
hundred CEOs and said we're going to ask

00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,630
you two questions number one looking at

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,210
your organization over the past I know

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:22,950
five ten years or so could you please

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:25,740
tell us what percentage of the failures

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:27,690
you suffered were treated as blameworthy

00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,510
so what percent would treat it as

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:33,090
blameworthy and then tell us what

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:35,700
percentage actually deserved to receive

00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:38,100
blame and by blame they meant you

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:42,919
pointed a finger at one person one

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:45,270
department one organization you you you

00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:46,970
so the CEOs went through all this very

00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,900
kindly and they provided the information

00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:52,160
answered your question number one what

00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:55,620
percentage were treated as blameworthy

00:21:52,160 --> 00:22:00,180
plus or minus more or less ninety

00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:04,040
percent cool what percentage deserved

00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:08,550
that the answer was two to five percent

00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:12,090
this shows just how much we love giving

00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:17,280
blame somebody has to be to blame this

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:19,470
is a problem so when we're looking into

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,000
the causes and effects of a failure we

00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,160
need to remember that the what is going

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,820
to be far far far far more important

00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:30,660
than the hoop we need to fix the problem

00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:32,280
not the symptom therefore when you're

00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,780
analyzing these failures you need to go

00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,390
beyond the superficial you need to just

00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,160
keep on digging there are lots of ways

00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,840
to do this but the simplest and easiest

00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:45,150
to implement and just about every

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:46,200
organization is the five wise how many

00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,740
of you have heard of the five wise

00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,480
before okay a few so it's pretty much

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,280
exactly what it sounds like except the

00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,300
five is more of a variable than a hard

00:22:53,280 --> 00:23:01,380
code so um well why did Three Mile

00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:04,800
Island go nuclear well because there was

00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,810
a valve that was left open well why was

00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,180
the valve left open because the

00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:11,460
technician did not close it why did the

00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:14,010
technician not close it well because the

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,570
light said that it was closed well why

00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,760
did the light say it was closed well

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:19,530
because it was designed improperly well

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,080
why and you just keep asking these wines

00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:24,270
until you get down to the real reason of

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,970
things so you use as many wise as

00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:29,910
necessary but you don't stop at the

00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:33,000
first one keep asking why until you get

00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:38,100
to the root cause very simple very easy

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,930
process to instill so as I mentioned

00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:43,590
earlier cultural changes are intensely

00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:45,240
difficult they are not likely to be even

00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,800
moderately successful if you don't get

00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,310
some sort of support from the powers

00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:57,230
that be we can learn from poor little

00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:59,220
pouch in ski on that one what you get

00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,630
what you're doing when you're trying to

00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,460
change a culture to

00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,260
Bray's failure and change is you are

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,760
questioning the status quo and in most

00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:08,040
organizations that doesn't go over well

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,160
without the support of your senior

00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,740
leadership so if you get that then what

00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:17,250
you're going to gain is your leaders

00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:20,310
leading by example they'll give you

00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:22,410
shelter from persecution you're going to

00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:25,350
get celebration of failure rather than

00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:28,290
finger-pointing and blame and you're

00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:30,990
going to get a cultural top-level fail

00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:32,820
early fail offer often reward system

00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:37,350
which is going to prevent failures from

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:39,920
reaching costly epic levels so if this

00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:42,390
organization happens to be a business

00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,640
what you may have to do to get this

00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:48,530
support is to hit them on the bottom

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:51,330
line unfortunately for better or worse

00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:53,010
money turns managerial heads and I am

00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:57,060
upper management and I'll tell you this

00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:58,350
is true so what you might have to do and

00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,480
it might be a little distasteful but

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:03,660
honey it's far far better than getting

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,330
fired for spending 20 million dollars on

00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:08,910
a project that dies you're going to need

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:11,310
to learn a little market stuff learn

00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:14,550
about a loss report learn about an roi

00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:17,730
report they don't have to be intense but

00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:19,740
they do have to be something bring those

00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:23,520
numbers that rationalization to your

00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:25,440
manager before you suggest hey here's

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,290
these great big changes I want to do

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,180
it's going to be awesome don't do that

00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:31,350
give a rationalization give why hit them

00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:37,080
in the bottom line you're much more

00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:39,330
likely to get their support so another

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,460
really incredibly effective way to

00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:45,120
change the culture is their churn and

00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:49,410
hiring as people leave as new Rex open

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,360
as your project expands um bring on

00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:54,930
people who are not afraid to try and

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,850
fail that's easy then you're kind of

00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:58,560
undermining the system from the inside

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,920
you're rebuilding it with new bricks

00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,480
this is incredibly effective but it can

00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,920
be dangerous because when you're doing

00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,630
something like this it can lead to

00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,480
groupthink and an incredible lack of

00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:11,940
diversity so be very careful when doing

00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,850
this it's effective but there are risks

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,549
involved

00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:19,080
so another solution for culture change

00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:23,159
encourage of reward people for reporting

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,960
problems in cases of potential failure

00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:29,159
silence is absolutely positively not

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:33,960
golden get people to question and to

00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:36,179
explore and not to assume change the

00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,869
incentives for people to share their

00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:43,049
information freely this is the Freedom

00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:46,519
of Information Act surprisingly short

00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:48,389
document considering how powerful it is

00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:50,159
another thing you can do within your

00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:53,700
organization please stop making

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,559
mountains out of molehills treating

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,299
small failures as big deals really miss

00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:01,799
understands how complex systems work so

00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:03,389
just stop it that said when

00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:05,210
somebody does come to you with a small

00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:08,159
problem please don't ignore it either

00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:09,389
small problems become great big ones so

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,190
when they are reported please deal with

00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:13,830
them in some way or at least analyze

00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,379
them and determine their risk make a an

00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,529
educated decision rather than

00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:20,580
normalizing the deviance and ignoring it

00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:22,049
while finding the problems after the

00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,950
fact is really good finding them

00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:28,289
beforehand is better so you should post

00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:30,600
mortem all of your projects not just the

00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:33,749
failures this minimizes that survivor

00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,389
bias i was mentioning earlier so let's

00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:39,090
say you like cars you want to learn more

00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:40,440
about the auto industry are you going to

00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,389
go out there and study just the big

00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,369
three are you really going to do that

00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:47,039
because early on in the auto industry

00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:51,539
there were over two thousand different

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:53,159
firms right now we're only aware of a

00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:56,039
small handful but there used to be an

00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:57,570
immense number of these things if you

00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:02,429
look at the ones that die you can learn

00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:07,139
so much the quite literal textbook

00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:09,119
example of Survivor bias I'm back in

00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:11,340
World War two we had a big problem we

00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,679
had planes that weren't coming back big

00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,539
problem oops we'd like those back and

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,830
the people in them especially so what

00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,909
they decide to do is okay we're gonna

00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,529
look at those planes that came back and

00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:20,730
we're going to look oh look bullet holes

00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:23,159
right there we're gonna put more armor

00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:25,859
there that's going to do it so did that

00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,539
send the planes back out did not

00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:31,379
increase the percentage returning

00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:33,479
and so some wag decided well wouldn't it

00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:35,609
be more effective if we went out in the

00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:39,239
field and you know found those planes

00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:40,859
that went down so he did that and he

00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:42,179
went out to the planes that went down it

00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:43,379
was a pretty dangerous thing but he

00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,070
discovered that what they really needed

00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:48,090
was more shielding on the cockpit

00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,259
wouldn't have noticed that if he hadn't

00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,700
gone out into the field so they did that

00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:53,580
and they added more shielding to the

00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,960
cockpit and surprising huzzah more

00:28:53,580 --> 00:29:00,690
planes started coming back more lives

00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:02,190
were saved what they were doing was

00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:06,749
looking finally at the whole picture

00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:08,369
rather than just half of it so when you

00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:10,619
start looking at the whole picture what

00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:15,029
are you going to notice are a lot of

00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:19,580
near misses the bird live this was in

00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:23,249
legit gp2 last year sorry Grand Prix too

00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:25,139
so these near misses well they look at

00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:29,009
us like a success at the outcome they're

00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:33,690
also near fails near misses our failures

00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:37,019
waiting to happen all you need is near

00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:41,879
misses in the failure research world are

00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:43,470
called latent errors they also

00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:45,239
contribute to normalization of deviance

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:47,789
you stop seeing what is right in front

00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:52,080
of you I know who did this but they're

00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:53,639
 genius so there are multiple

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,989
near misses before just about every

00:29:53,639 --> 00:29:56,460
disaster in business crisis and

00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:58,679
typically they're ignored at the time

00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:01,080
they occur what we need to start doing

00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,729
is postmortem you everything because if

00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,109
you post mortem only the failures you'll

00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:07,889
miss these latent errors and you have a

00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:09,710
disaster waiting to happen I meant to

00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:13,049
hide the slides well blows through it

00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:15,479
layton error a near miss plus an

00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:17,840
enabling condition equals things not

00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:21,479
quite working the way you planned

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,729
enabling conditions near miss is a

00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:25,289
latent error without the enabling

00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:29,330
condition when you add an enabling

00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:29,330
condition in there you get failure

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,190
so in our arrogance we think we can

00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:38,230
control enabling conditions but we can't

00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,600
they're out of our hands this gets back

00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:42,220
to our illusion of control what we need

00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,780
to start doing instead of trying to fix

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,610
the enabling conditions that you can do

00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:49,410
nothing about whether it's a windless

00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:52,450
day or not you know weather weather and

00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:56,650
situations occur such that the o2 rings

00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:58,390
will make your space shuttle explode no

00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:01,080
we don't need to focus on those we need

00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:04,480
to focus on the latent errors instead

00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:07,120
way to do that particularly in very high

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,580
risk situations not always not saying

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,020
this is the Silver Bullet there is no

00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,080
silver bullet let no one tell you

00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:16,179
otherwise so for high-risk situations

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,490
really great way to avoid those enabling

00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:21,390
conditions are to have process driven

00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:23,559
decisions rather than outcome driven

00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,600
this is going to minimize the effect of

00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:28,000
enabling conditions if you are driven by

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,850
process if you have a checklist if you

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,809
tick every box you avoid a lot of those

00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:36,850
problems this also allows you to

00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:39,760
identify the qualities which separate

00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:41,559
success and failures they say that you

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,780
can't compare apples and oranges but if

00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:48,760
you've never seen them side-by-side

00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:50,890
really how do you know so another

00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,190
solution is not to allow assumptions to

00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:57,100
become truths document and share all of

00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:00,419
your assumptions in advance document

00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:04,120
share these are key undocumented

00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:06,660
undocumented assumptions has been shown

00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,740
to be mentally converted into facts

00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,510
let's say you're sitting in a meeting I

00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:14,040
know this has happened to all of us

00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:17,470
you're talking about a new project and

00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:19,360
some jerk across the table says oh you

00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,620
know I think we can have this done in

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,200
two months but don't quote me on that

00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,730
I'll go check doesn't matter whether he

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,470
actually goes Chuck doesn't matter

00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,880
whether he changes his number because

00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,580
the first number is going to stick in

00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,500
everyone's head now this project is only

00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,660
going to take two months so what you

00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:37,419
need to do is have a process which says

00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:40,660
okay what are our assumptions we assume

00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:43,990
two months document that share it and

00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:45,070
then later on in the process revisit it

00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:51,309
and reassess it and make sure

00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:53,919
it still holds true while doing this one

00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:59,799
of the most often overlooked assumptions

00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:02,950
are criteria for success some people are

00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:04,929
going to think these are obvious but

00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:07,809
their idea of success might not match

00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:09,190
your idea of success furthermore if you

00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:10,600
don't call it out explicitly at the

00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:12,159
beginning of the project and by the end

00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,649
you may have found that your target has

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:20,740
shifted so document this it is an

00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:22,840
assumption document share revisit so for

00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,730
all this documentation i recommend

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,549
simple and familiar tools to report and

00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:31,059
track failure conditions when they occur

00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:35,590
the easiest one here's your damn bug

00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:37,120
tracker have a failure tracker in that

00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:41,320
you track not only the failures you've

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:43,149
found but also your assumptions this

00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,129
allows you to correct and communicate

00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:46,809
all of this information in a

00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:50,950
standardized way where everyone knows

00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:52,899
how to find it as you're analyzing these

00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:55,750
things using a bug tracker also allows

00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:58,870
you to communicate not only the what but

00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:02,620
the why this fosters learning and helps

00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:04,450
diminish cargo CULTAN as I've said a few

00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,029
times already this failure tracker has

00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,950
to be open to everyone if you hide it if

00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:11,200
you make sure only certain people can

00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:13,119
see it then what that is is a culture

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,010
which is not embracing change which is

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,960
not embracing failure it's one that's

00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:19,270
still ashamed of the fact that they

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,889
up some times that's no good that's not

00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,540
a healthy culture you're not going to

00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,220
learn what you can from that so make

00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:26,829
sure your failure tracker is open to

00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:29,069
everyone otherwise what you're going to

00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:30,909
end up with our organizational silos and

00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:33,399
organizational silos disperse

00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:35,950
responsibility and information and they

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:41,500
lead to an increase in layton errors and

00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:42,909
unreported failures however now that

00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,470
you've got this failure tracker and

00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:46,980
people are writing in it those

00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:49,750
reports can't go into a black hole

00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:52,899
create a team and a process to review

00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:55,060
and analyze them regularly these failure

00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:56,919
analysis teams they should be

00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,780
interdisciplinary bring in people from

00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:00,610
different parts of the project

00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,190
different parts of the company different

00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:04,360
departments because that's what you're

00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,460
going to then you're going to get a

00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:09,610
diverse team and diverse teams question

00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:11,260
assumptions diverse teams ask really

00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:13,330
interesting questions that you wouldn't

00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:18,070
have thought of and because of that

00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:20,290
diverse teams kill zombies furthermore

00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:22,540
they get to the root cause of things far

00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:26,650
more efficiently than if you have a team

00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:28,450
of just your project owners when you do

00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,070
that what you're able to do is find and

00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,560
fix the problem and not just the symptom

00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:35,440
and as well you can determine the

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,440
potential risk of operation deviations

00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,700
from the norm and they can form

00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,060
decisions rather than suffer from

00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:45,610
normalization of deviance so I keep

00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:49,510
talking about looking at and reassessing

00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:53,080
those documented assumptions how do you

00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:54,850
do that well during every project have

00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:58,060
built-in checkpoints for reevaluating

00:35:54,850 --> 00:36:02,020
those assumptions and goals anyone know

00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:06,190
what this is all right checkpoint

00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:08,140
charlie so when you're checking your

00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:10,480
assumptions ask yourself are they still

00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:14,740
valid do we need to shift do we need to

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,540
change those criteria for success are

00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,310
you still on track do they still hold

00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,970
true have you talked to your customer do

00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:24,280
they still really want this thing as

00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:28,480
well what you get to do when you're

00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:30,820
doing this you get to look at your

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,690
failures and your successes and salvage

00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:36,730
the bits that are good so just as in

00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:39,100
your failures there are some pieces that

00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:41,680
worked and in your successes there are

00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,030
some pieces that are not those are still

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,800
valuable pieces that's so valuable

00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:46,390
information you still built that really

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,130
hot library that you can use in the

00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,540
next project don't just pitch it out the

00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:52,990
door because the entire project went

00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,580
tits up don't do that so another way to

00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:58,150
do this and one of my favorite as a

00:36:54,580 --> 00:37:00,640
manager fund only to the next checkpoint

00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:04,480
now that you have them only fund the

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,820
project to that checkpoint have a check

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,500
at the assumptions see that everything

00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,030
is still on track see that things are

00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,400
going on now when I say this to

00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,990
engineers they often freak out the like

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,180
but

00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:17,190
put all that effort in and now you're

00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,530
going to kill my project it's like well

00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:21,930
yeah because your project isn't working

00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:23,190
honey why would I continued funding

00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:25,320
something that isn't going to be

00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:27,300
successful and furthermore why would you

00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,640
want to work on it I know you have an

00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:33,300
emotional attachment to it but let it go

00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:35,610
your work is not you and here's another

00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:37,560
carrot for you we've got this huge

00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:39,390
backlog of awesome that we want to

00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,920
work on and we can't because you're on a

00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:44,130
zombie project and it's eating your

00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,050
brain so we're going to kill that so

00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,090
funding only to the next checkpoint is

00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,860
incredibly useful but you got to have

00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,960
those checkpoints first and you have got

00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:54,840
to have those assumptions so you can

00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:59,030
check them at your checkpoint so quick

00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:02,310
tldr failure is absolutely inevitable

00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:04,080
it's a really great teacher there are

00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,970
many cultural and psychological reasons

00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,380
for failure and it can be prevented

00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,570
through cultural change joined with

00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,010
smart processes you learn to love

00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,950
failure and you're going to suffer from

00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:16,190
an overabundance of success now I have

00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:20,220
some goodies for you as far as resources

00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:23,090
when I was doing my research I made a

00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:27,900
lovely bibliography for you fine people

00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:29,850
this has a the wait for everyone to

00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:33,750
start typing they're snapping photos or

00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:35,310
something so this contains the citations

00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:39,090
not only for my original eleven hundred

00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:42,090
pages of research but also the research

00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:43,710
I've done in the meantime and the best

00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:47,430
goodie if you don't feel like reading

00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:50,670
over 2,000 pages of failure I think that

00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:54,090
sounds a little depressing I have 122

00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:55,680
pages of my own notes that I wrote while

00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:59,310
doing that so you get kind of the

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,880
Reader's Digest version another really

00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:04,250
great resource and I love love love at

00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,200
recommending this to people I just it my

00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:11,540
favorite podcast it's called disaster

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:17,520
cast you that disaster cast that coat UK

00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:19,590
it's by a safety engineer drew ray from

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,690
Australia so he sounds fabulous to

00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,100
listen to he talked about disasters

00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,800
accidents and how to stop them from

00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,410
happening

00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,060
and it's brilliant you listen to this

00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:30,010
and you're never going to want to get on

00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:33,610
another airplane and another train ride

00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:36,250
a bike boil some water it's just great

00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:39,750
and what I've learned from this he

00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:42,550
covers accidents disasters failures

00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:44,980
primarily in the transportation field

00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:49,000
but he also looks at Civic engineering

00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:50,560
he looks at movies sometimes so what

00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,360
this has shown me and really drilled

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:55,780
home is that what we deal with here in

00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:57,550
software engineering everyone deals with

00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,310
it everywhere we are not special

00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:02,650
delicate little snowflakes these

00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:05,280
generalities they apply to everyone not

00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:08,440
just us not just business you know so

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,530
drew help me learn that and he's

00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,720
entertaining as hell and of course

00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:15,370
another resource is standing right in

00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,080
front of you if you want to learn more

00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:19,690
about failure I may have done a little

00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:24,310
bit on it and i also have a lot of

00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:25,630
practical first-hand experience so

00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:30,630
that's really all i have today and we

00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,630
have reached QA time so thank you

00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:44,260
alright any questions comments concerns

00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:45,490
once yes dear there was a real dog in

00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,740
the photo of all the pleasure dogs it is

00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:55,240
right in the middle I can show you later

00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:59,080
if you need yes sir my most useful

00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:02,410
failure is a bit too raw at the moment

00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:05,850
and so I quite literally cannot talk

00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:05,850
about it because I signed some paperwork

00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:20,050
next oh you're a troublemaker ooh a

00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:22,900
recent success that I saw some failure

00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:28,240
in I am not prepared to answer that

00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:30,010
question oh no no it's like I I'm not

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,050
very good at generating information and

00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:34,870
dredging up facts on the fly which is

00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:37,120
really why I have my bibliography 120

00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:38,980
some pages and notes so unfortunately I

00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,990
can't answer that not because I don't

00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:48,960
want to but I literally cannot I'm sorry

00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:48,960
I apologize more oh I'm sorry yes

00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,500
okay so the question is I talked about

00:42:03,029 --> 00:42:06,779
dealing with failure in a rational

00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:12,329
analytic way and how to deal with it an

00:42:06,779 --> 00:42:15,390
emotional way I am not qualified to be a

00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:20,130
therapist so anything I say you know I

00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:21,900
don't play one on TV lalala it's going

00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:24,119
to vary by person that's where I get

00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:27,359
back to the it depends what's going to

00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:28,500
help you get through that situation what

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,119
helps me is not going to be the same

00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,680
thing that helps you not going to be the

00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:35,569
same thing that helps belden not going

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,569
to be the same thing that helps give so

00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:45,119
so I I really can't answer that for

00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:49,260
myself personally it is falling back on

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,690
the analytics and recognizing that there

00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:54,960
are methods to madness sometimes and

00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:57,990
finding that and trying to use that as a

00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,740
path through the dark tangled forest of

00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:04,619
brambles that's me that's what I do but

00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,980
it varies we can hash through it more

00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:12,450
over beers later if you want

00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:15,569
troublemaker yes practice does make it

00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:17,130
less scary it is still always scary I

00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:19,140
can't even tell you the number of times

00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:21,029
I've given this talk maybe five six Wow

00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:23,789
and I talk all the time I think I've got

00:43:21,029 --> 00:43:25,470
five conferences this year there's

00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:28,349
always a chance I'm going to fail last

00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:31,470
year das kann I was in when the

00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:33,720
ballrooms when the great big rooms and

00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:35,760
the man before me ran over 15 minutes

00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,549
over on his time and I got up there and

00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,640
i plug in and like I got all this

00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:44,700
hold on plug-in I'm like okay go and my

00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:46,380
speaker notes don't show up I don't know

00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,319
if you notice but I really rely on those

00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:51,450
bastards I'm constantly like lava and I

00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:54,470
literally in front of the I think they

00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:57,550
were probably 300 people in the room

00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:59,500
bucket we're doing this click

00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:04,900
that didn't make it on the video for

00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:06,880
some reason I don't know but yeah but I

00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,520
wasn't I'm still not scared to come up

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,740
here and do this because I've seen I've

00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:15,010
survived through it and that's what you

00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:17,650
learn oh right I up it's cool

00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:19,660
it's cool man because I lived and I

00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:21,670
learned something if you're doing this

00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,560
you will learn something which will make

00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:30,850
sure you're less likely to do that again

00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:49,990
I have speakers notes for example yes

00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:52,330
sir get the out life is too short

00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:54,130
to deal with that and I'm sorry

00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:58,030
where engineers and we're in a goddamn

00:44:54,130 --> 00:45:00,160
bubble there are people you can't swing

00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:03,100
half a dead cat without finding somebody

00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,920
who's hiring this conference is proof of

00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:08,350
it just about every single session

00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,420
except for mine has had going hey by the

00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:14,380
way we're hiring get out of there go

00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:18,640
find someone who appreciates you at

00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:21,240
speaking of which if I am not asleep I

00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:24,220
will probably be at the job symposium

00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,390
that Orie is running so if you are in a

00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:28,240
bad situation or something like that

00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:29,980
then come talk to me and I'll help you

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,020
with your resume and you know what you

00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:36,000
want to be when you grow up and all that

00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:36,000
good stuff is

00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:49,959
oh he got disappeared it took a little

00:45:42,459 --> 00:45:59,670
while oh yeah well I kind of you know do

00:45:49,959 --> 00:46:03,099
as I say not as I do he did uh the the

00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:07,059
biographies I've read of him show him as

00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:10,569
somebody who has very little a political

00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:11,589
awareness shall we say he knows this is

00:46:10,569 --> 00:46:13,930
what we got to do so I'm just going to

00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:17,949
say it we all know those people we Bend

00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:23,799
those people so yeah he said the right

00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:32,979
thing but not the right way more you

00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:36,640
again yes yes I'll get this on video

00:46:32,979 --> 00:46:39,989
again Sawyer is my patronus have you

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,779
read Harry Potter or watch the movies oh

00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:50,049
um when there is a dementor coming to

00:46:43,779 --> 00:46:52,089
get you you can yeah yeah yeah they I'm

00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:55,380
trying to use Petronas instead of spirit

00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:57,699
animal because people get upset for so

00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,440
he's my patronus plus I think he would

00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:04,359
appreciate it more I haven't really told

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:06,459
him any of this yet by the way so oh oh

00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:10,269
I know he'll find out if someone hasn't

00:47:06,459 --> 00:47:16,989
already tweeted the oh no no he's a

00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:22,799
pretty well no no I'm called causing him

00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:31,299
calling him a protecting spirit man

00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:34,739
recidivist we all have up no no one's

00:47:31,299 --> 00:47:37,299
watching at all hi YouTube no uh

00:47:34,739 --> 00:47:39,339
protection did from your own personal

00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:43,079
whatever you know like I said it depends

00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:43,079
I know you're just being a troublemaker

00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:48,900
god are you guys like tag team or

00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:52,160
something okay we only have like a

00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,160
minute so i'll pass go

00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:16,980
mm-hmm well there's a karmic it's a

00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,420
karmic sort of thing but it goes back

00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,859
the keynote yesterday that social

00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:25,619
engineering right okay I'm going to go

00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:27,930
to the elevator right so that's that's

00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:29,640
precisely what happened and it's another

00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:30,930
one of those cognitive biases but I

00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:33,089
don't know exactly which one and now I

00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:34,529
gotta go look it up all right we are

00:48:33,089 --> 00:48:37,079
running out of time if anyone wants me
