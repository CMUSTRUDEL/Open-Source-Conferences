okay I think we can begin good to go

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:38,720
keep a place in your heart for this

00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:41,629
human today he's going into surgery are

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,329
you open to seeing the world in from a

00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:46,099
different perspective even if that means

00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:51,650
walking out of here believing less than

00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:53,569
you do now this talk isn't the truth

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,090
it's my attempt to explain my

00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:59,150
perspective to myself in a way that

00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,629
might be useful to others whenever I say

00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,349
you in this talk I'm referring to me

00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:06,650
that's really there'll be a lot of

00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:09,170
emissions and many simplifications take

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:12,860
what appeals to you leave the rest i'll

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,870
be uploading the notes say i have some

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,060
information an idea that i want to tell

00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,889
you about I translate the idea into

00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,840
words I say the words you hear them you

00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,520
translate them back into an idea into a

00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,590
concept we do it all the time that's

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,590
what we're doing here at Yap see and it

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:30,530
works except maybe not as well as we

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,930
like to think I'm a struggle to pick

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,960
words and sentences that convey the idea

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,530
accurately and even if I do that well a

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,490
lot of detail and nuance is lost i'm

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,620
picking words and forming sentences

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:45,260
based on my interpretation of the

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:47,630
meaning of those words the words i pick

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:51,080
a based on my perspective my worldview

00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:53,240
my biases my baggage my frame of

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,669
reference but that's not clear to you

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,919
the listener you don't know my frame you

00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:59,539
hear the words i've spoken unpack them

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,669
into concepts based on your

00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:04,099
interpretation of the words your

00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:09,590
perspective your worldview your baggage

00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:10,970
your frame of reference your

00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,430
understanding of the information that

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,470
I'm trying to convey is inevitably

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,289
influenced by your beliefs it's built

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,789
into the very process of communication

00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:22,219
it's like a very lossy image compression

00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:23,400
algorithm but you the listener don't

00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:25,080
notice because of the

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,780
that you add into the image as you

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,120
reconstruct it we both believe the

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,130
information has been shared but we can't

00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,300
be sure I might ask you if you

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,310
understood and you'll say yes because

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,220
you believe you have this is happening

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,949
all the time even as you listen to me

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,280
now so always be doubtful of your

00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:45,840
understanding hold it lightly be aware

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,110
that it's always reflecting your own

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,370
beliefs so here's an exercise for you

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,020
while you're listening to this talk

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,840
you're bound to have thoughts like oh

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,330
he's talking about X where X is some

00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,460
label try to stay aware of your thoughts

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,539
enough to notice when that happens and

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,760
to notice two things in particular

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:05,669
firstly what it feels like as the

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,620
thought arrives a sense of solving a

00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:10,199
puzzle winning a prize a sense of

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,720
gaining something and secondly notice

00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,210
any baggage that comes with that label x

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,030
whatever it is notice any thoughts and

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,190
feelings that arise in your awareness

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:24,060
just after the oh he's talking about x

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,410
thought now let's look at what happens

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,190
when i try to share something more

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:33,030
subtle like a sensory experience perhaps

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:35,160
the look of an exotic butterfly the feel

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,680
of a fabric the taste of a food the

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,120
sound of some music in order to

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,530
communicate the experience first i have

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,120
to conceptualize it and i will struggle

00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,650
to form accurate concepts of my

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,979
experience and no matter how well I do

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,419
that detail and nuance is lost then

00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,919
there are all the problems of

00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:52,949
communicating the concepts that I've

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,050
outlined before and again more detail

00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:56,639
and nuance is lost you'll form your

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,860
conceptual version based on your own

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,349
understanding of the words you hear and

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,199
those concepts may in evoke experiences

00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:06,539
in you but what you experience isn't

00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,050
what I experienced what you experience

00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:11,699
is a patchwork of your own experiences

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,770
I'm possibly not even appropriate ones

00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,169
depending on how you've interpreted the

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:19,139
words I've used technically this is

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,970
known as the explanatory gap similes and

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,860
metaphors and art and poetry help us

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:26,060
paper over the gap but usually we don't

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,060
even notice the gap is there

00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:32,929
imagine you're eating some of your

00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:35,629
favorite chocolate try to recall the

00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:37,309
actual experience how would you express

00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:40,699
that experience to somebody who has

00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:44,029
never eaten chocolate try it now in your

00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:45,829
own mind you might be choosing some

00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:48,229
words and phrases to describe the color

00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:50,569
the smell the bite texture melting

00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:53,509
flavors but can you see how each of

00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:57,139
those words and phrases is a label a

00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:59,359
symbol a vast simplification that falls

00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:01,639
far short of the actual experience and

00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:03,529
yet it's that very simplification that

00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,839
abstraction which enables effective

00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:08,959
thinking and communication what at least

00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:10,779
appears to so when someone tries to

00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,569
share their experience with you any

00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:16,969
experience including this talk always be

00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:19,189
doubtful of your understanding hold it

00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:27,699
lightly be aware that it's a reflection

00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:30,649
of your own experiences all knowledge

00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:33,469
all beliefs exist within a frame of

00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:36,139
reference knowledge seems absolutely

00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:38,209
true only to the extent that we're

00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:41,240
incapable of stepping outside the frame

00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:42,919
of reference in which it's based you'd

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,629
probably agree that I'm stationary now

00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,059
pretty much it's obvious it's

00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:48,889
self-evident so you disagree with me if

00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:51,649
I said I was traveling at 300 miles per

00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:54,649
second clearly I'm wrong and possibly

00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:57,199
crazy I am stationary you are stationary

00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:59,029
that's true it is also true that we're

00:08:57,199 --> 00:09:01,550
moving at over 700 miles an hour on the

00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:03,800
earth as it spins it's also true that

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,990
we're moving at 67,000 miles an hour as

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,300
we all with the son of four hundred and

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,939
fifty thousand miles an hour as we orbit

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,439
the Milky Way now 1.3 million miles an

00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:15,199
hour relative to the cosmic background

00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:18,579
radiation each of those speeds is

00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:22,610
absolutely true for a certain view point

00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:24,170
perspective frame of reference when

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,180
you're open to doubting your current

00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:31,279
perspective when you hold it likely it's

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:34,550
easier to see others what are you taking

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,170
for granted what views do you hold about

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,000
yourself and others in the world around

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,149
you that are so obvious to you so

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,660
self-evident that you don't notice them

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:44,510
it's hard to tell

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:47,330
isn't it they form what I call your

00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:49,370
frame of reference the frame through

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,720
which we interpret the world and if

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,370
you're not aware of them then you're not

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,810
aware of how they're influencing your

00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,210
experience and understanding of the

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,500
world you've probably had the experience

00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,000
of discussing something with someone

00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,110
perhaps arguing about it I'll need to

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,540
discover there's been a misunderstanding

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,550
about the words used or the

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,310
circumstances around the issue you've

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,600
had different frames of reference how

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,490
often have you had an argument about

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,410
something where you've had different

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:16,670
frames of reference without realizing it

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,650
ultimately everybody's frame of

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,050
reference is different everybody's

00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:22,760
experience is different and this is

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,480
beautifully summed up by the phrase no

00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,430
two people ever read the same book it's

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,040
amazing how often we argue over whether

00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:35,350
a book is good or bad as if there's some

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:41,090
Universal frame it is what it is our

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:42,560
judgment of it is our own my perspective

00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,970
shifted a few years ago and the funny

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,610
thing about a change in perspective is

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:49,250
that nothing changes and yet the

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:51,200
experience of everything changes so this

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,880
whole talk comes out of my fascination

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,620
with the idea of how I'd explain this to

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:59,120
myself and the discovery of how

00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:01,970
incredibly difficult it is our senses

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,540
only pick up a tiny tiny fraction I

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,700
skipped a slide there go back our senses

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,460
only pick up a tiny tiny fraction of the

00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,200
reality that surround us reducing it

00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,850
into patterns of low bandwidth signals

00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,890
that are further degraded as they travel

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,140
along the nerves and even with this

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:21,080
reduction our brain is immersed in a

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,610
flood of sensory information in some way

00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,860
that's not understood these simple

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,780
signals entering the brain a process

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,580
filtered and reconstructed into the

00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:32,270
parent Technicolor world of our

00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:34,310
day-to-day experience or qualia as a

00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,750
technical term the mystery surrounding

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,450
this process is known as the hard

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:41,480
problem of consciousness our awareness

00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:44,270
is immersed not in the outer reality but

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:49,430
in our reconstructed experience color

00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:51,110
for example is an illusion for reason we

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,420
reason about and act upon this

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,010
reconstructed experience for most

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,250
animals that boils down to decide

00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,740
adding friend or foe meal or meat as

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:04,220
humans we operate at a higher level

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,630
hopefully I want to touch upon two

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,270
particular aspects of experience

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,950
alliteration and labeling habituation is

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,680
a fancy word meaning getting used to

00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,330
things getting used to what's normal

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,150
tuning out the normal lets the mind

00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,340
focus its attention limited attention on

00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:21,680
what's unusual abnormal on the

00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,570
differences this is a simple yet

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,940
powerful mechanism wide deep into all

00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:29,330
organisms you're probably familiar with

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,820
the example of boiling a frog slowly we

00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:34,490
can get used to almost anything we

00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:37,100
already have personally socially

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:39,830
culturally we are deeply habituated into

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,020
our experience another way to say it is

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,270
that we're conditioned by our parents by

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,090
a habits by our peers our society

00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,860
culture the catch here is that almost by

00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,930
definition it's really hard to be aware

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,800
of the conditioning it's become part of

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:56,810
our frame of reference habituation stems

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,020
the flood of sensory input filtering it

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:02,470
down to just things we notice the next

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,930
step is to reduce the noticed experience

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:10,520
noticed experiences to labels friend foe

00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:13,040
meal mate partner chair house tree these

00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,110
are concepts symbols which we've linked

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,580
to words in our language and with them

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,700
we can talk about trees without having

00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,260
to have an actual tree here labels are

00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,090
an essential raw material for

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,720
higher-level thinking learning and

00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:28,160
communication yet they're also extract

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,760
abstractions isolating us from the

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,990
actual experience the actual tree and

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,120
because our attention can move so easily

00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:37,520
between the concept of a tree and the

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,410
experience of a specific tree we rarely

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,090
notice the emptiness of the abstractions

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:46,550
and symbols were thinking with in order

00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:49,310
to label something we have to categorize

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:52,610
it to decide what label to apply we have

00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:54,350
to judge it to form an opinion so our

00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,630
thinking and speaking of streams of

00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:59,810
categorization polarization judgment

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:03,950
labeling this is necessary and normal so

00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:06,470
of course we rarely aware of hot cold

00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:09,250
right wrong terrorist freedom fighter

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:12,250
liberal conservative between pairs is

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:15,520
range and the middle ground is nuanced

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,290
and much harder to label a mind wants to

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,760
assign labels for thinking and

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,070
communication so we naturally tend

00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,100
towards using the clear labels at the

00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:28,710
extremes once again detail and nuance is

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:30,700
lost to have an experience any

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,420
experience we have to be consciously

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:40,390
aware of it but what is consciousness

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:42,850
what is awareness no one knows so let's

00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:46,120
try a simple question what is the

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:49,690
experience of awareness can we be aware

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,950
of being aware I tend to think of

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,050
awareness as being like a very wide

00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,580
flood light softly illuminating

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,130
everything you're aware of not just

00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:00,300
sites but sounds thoughts feelings

00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:03,460
everything that's in our awareness

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,990
attention is a word we used to refer to

00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,480
awareness when it's more concentrated

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:10,450
like the beam of a torch focusing on one

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,770
particular thing I'm sure you've noticed

00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,080
that the more intensely you pay

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:17,620
attention to something the less aware

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,020
you are of everything else so let's do a

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,400
simple exercise in awareness because you

00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,190
can appreciate now it's so important to

00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,839
experience things for yourself place

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:29,320
your attention on the feeling coming

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:32,050
from your left foot the feel of your

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,970
shoe warmth some tingling maybe without

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,450
moving or thinking about your foot just

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:41,680
simply be with it with a quiet mind

00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:44,110
right now what you're paying attention

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,680
to is your left foot what you're paying

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:49,360
attention with is something else will do

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,980
again but this time after a few seconds

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,020
I'll say something to pump some thinking

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,839
and I want you to notice what happens to

00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,580
your attention when you start thinking

00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:04,780
so pay attention to your foot again with

00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:06,250
a quiet mind seven times 12 did you

00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,610
notice your attention move away from

00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:12,130
your foot yeah the the focus of your

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:16,960
attention can't be on your your foot and

00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:19,360
a thought at the same time you need to

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,560
be and your full attention can't be on a

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,329
thought and something else at the same

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,959
time you need to be aware or

00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:29,249
of the thought so awareness is different

00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:31,959
to thinking awareness is primary

00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:34,569
thinking feeling seeing and every other

00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:37,299
kind of experience a secondary they only

00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:42,699
they are only known within your

00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:45,819
awareness so what why am I talking about

00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:47,410
all this conscious aware space stuff or

00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:49,660
becoming more aware of our awareness

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:53,350
gives us a different perspective on the

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:55,389
content and experience of our life it's

00:16:53,350 --> 00:17:00,100
easier to see habitual assumptions and

00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:01,929
biases so we can choose to question it's

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,670
easier to see the repetitive patterns in

00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:06,459
our thoughts so we can take our

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:09,159
attention elsewhere it's easier to find

00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,569
space around powerful feelings and

00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:13,269
emotions so they're less likely to

00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:15,850
overwhelm us it's easier to have choice

00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:20,079
in how we respond to life's events

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:24,069
triggers and challenges but there's a

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,480
catch and it's a big one as you bring

00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:27,399
more awareness to your thinking it's

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,590
very tempting to start thinking about

00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:31,120
you're thinking especially when you

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,940
start to notice how unhelpful most of it

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,679
is you're thinking mind will happily

00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,570
analyze and judge your thoughts for you

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,450
after all analyzing and judging is what

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,649
it does best it'll happily provide a

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,240
running commentary on the running

00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:45,730
commentary that's already in your head

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,200
and it would be foolish to assume that

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,559
you're thinking mind would be impartial

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,909
about its own thoughts now if you want

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,149
to understand your mind you need to

00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:57,340
observe it just observing your thoughts

00:17:55,149 --> 00:18:00,130
without judgement starts to bring about

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:03,340
change a neutral compassionate

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,990
perspective acts like a solvent it seems

00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,840
that within the awareness a kind of

00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,309
intelligence is a work presumably the

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,289
same kind that manages your blood

00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:14,100
chemistry what drives your car while

00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:16,570
you're thinking of something else I'd

00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,010
like to highlight one pattern of

00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,350
thinking that you may have already

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:23,110
noticed that of wanting things to be

00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,610
different to how they are this is a

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,200
structural pattern of thinking there's

00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,059
independent to the actual content of

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,760
your life you can always find something

00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:31,960
you want to be different imagine you're

00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,700
having an ordinary day not particularly

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,100
good or bad just typical your default

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,770
state then a thought enters your mind

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,299
I wish I was happier it could be any

00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,760
similar wanting things to be different

00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:46,360
to how they are what's the effect of

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:49,870
that thought on your happiness you get

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,520
less happy in that interesting but note

00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,530
that it's not the thought that has that

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,860
effect no the effect of becoming less

00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:58,299
happy is from believing the thought from

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,250
grabbing the fleeting thought and

00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:03,640
turning it into an opinion that you hold

00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,960
onto a belief that becomes part of your

00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,400
frame of reference through which you're

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,809
continually processing your experience

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,970
and of course with that opinion with

00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:11,620
that belief you will easily find endless

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,020
confirmation that yes you wish you were

00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,669
happier the thought reinforces the

00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,919
belief in a cycle that's hard to break

00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:19,720
out of so it helps to try to tease apart

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,220
the situation from the thoughts you're

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,169
having about it in this example there is

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,630
no situation to happen happiness is

00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:26,710
caused entirely by the thought usually

00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,110
though there will be some underlying

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,669
situation the prompts the thought that

00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,110
becomes an opinion that alters your

00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,760
frame of reference that biases your

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,929
towards confirmation of the opinion

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,510
prompting more thought in the cycle

00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:39,370
continues and usually the web of

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,080
thoughts that we weave into a story

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,850
around the situation of the source of

00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,940
much more unhappiness than the situation

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,260
itself now imagine you've been believing

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,789
out wish things were different thought

00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,669
like that for some time and then at some

00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:55,140
point you cease believing it what's the

00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:57,940
effect you get happy in that interesting

00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,610
but you see the catch it's a lot easier

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:03,909
to believe a thought than it is to stop

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:06,520
believing one we live in and maintain a

00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:09,370
bubble of rightness how many of your

00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,799
opinions do you think are wrong probably

00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,450
none and have you noticed that most of

00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:16,600
your thoughts arrive with a built-in

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,610
sense of truth and importance these

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,159
processes are so deep and so habitual

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,470
that we rarely notice them it's hard to

00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:25,600
have a clear vantage point to see them

00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,850
at work within us and that's where the

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,370
awareness comes in it gives you a place

00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:33,250
to observe the mind stepping out of the

00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,690
cycle of thinking and judgment I'm not

00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,150
asking you to believe any of this I'm

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:40,030
inviting you to get curious about your

00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,860
own experience of your own life to

00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,559
practice bringing a non-judgmental

00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,419
awareness to your own inner processes to

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,940
begin to see your own frame of reference

00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:49,610
and how it's continuously influencing

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,070
your experian

00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,840
it's to look deeply into the beliefs
