okay so many people are still coming in

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,960
i'm going to get started because i don't

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:10,920
have a lot of time so um so i'm good

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:23,970
morning my name is wat Minkowski talks

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:26,160
on um hello ok ok and Batok solanum hack

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,109
your mac with pearl and just as like a

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,980
very minor warning there's going to be

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,530
one or two slides with with some maybe

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,649
pg-13 language on it I couldn't get rid

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,059
of them so I apologize about that so

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,350
just so you're aware before we get up to

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:45,450
that so um I'm assuming everyone in here

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,940
has a mac right so I really like my back

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,460
great and like backs are really just

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,219
unix so when I was working on my

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,489
dissertation I just some I did almost

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,360
all my work on macs and you know most of

00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,399
the time when I was working on my

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,329
dissertation it looked like that right

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,500
it's just yeah i was using it as a fancy

00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,970
yeah i was doing the terminal most of

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,280
the time i was using as a fancy unix box

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:11,369
but like macs are shiny to write you can

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,600
do all this stuff and well I don't know

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,970
sometimes it gets maybe a little too

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,860
shiny but um but I'm like I'm lazy right

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,049
then I don't want to I don't know if you

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,210
can read that but I mean this it wants

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,420
to learn what's on Coco let's go along

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,159
with all those like square brackets yeah

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,000
so it's like a big learning curve if you

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,990
want to do anything generally but um I

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,340
guess at emily's you guys want to sit on

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,700
my calendar II pearl I don't want to be

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,259
writing Coco code and pearl like and

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,990
lots of other areas could be a bridge

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,270
between the shiny like the sort of

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,110
lowdown you know command-line unix world

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:53,070
and the fancy GUI world of Macintosh

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,329
programming and and also Python or Ruby

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,649
and other things but this is a pearl

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,729
conference so I want to talk about that

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,560
and I'm so most of I got the idea from

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,570
this from mark fowler who a couple of

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,610
years ago at the linux parole at the

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,369
london pearl workshop did a talk called

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,720
pimp your mac with pearl this is the

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,780
pg-13 part of the talk so um it was a

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,550
great site

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,970
had all sorts of information about doing

00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,350
that pearl of stuff on your mac but it's

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,810
I don't know what happened to it it's

00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:25,959
just not even online anymore so um it's

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,430
very sad but if you google for pimp your

00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:32,380
mac with pearl they recorded his talk

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:34,870
and it's really good marks talk he

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:38,080
covered about 25 or 30 different things

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,330
in 20 minutes at a very high level I'm

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,819
going to just cover two things because I

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,620
don't have a lot of time today covers

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:46,390
services and how great how to write

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,100
services in pearl and I will talking

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,790
about FS events and how to access them

00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,350
in pearl so services anyone knows that

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,870
people know what services are has anyone

00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:58,810
used services and on macs and it rick

00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,950
has not a lot of people so you who

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,569
doesn't even know what services are

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,519
who's anyone never even looked at the

00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:06,060
services menu and seeing what's in there

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,450
yeah that's probably more likely right

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:12,430
so like Windows has services to write

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,170
services are what the windows world

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:18,100
calls what we call daemons they call

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:21,370
services so these are not like them the

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:24,040
services on on OS 10 are borrowed from

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,110
the world of next remember like

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,910
everything in OS 10 is is from mex and

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,850
services in particular and their way of

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:34,090
doing inter application communications

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,260
they're a bit like the way we can put

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,120
all different kinds of commands like

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:40,780
sort and grab than things on the command

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,370
line except that it's kind of intended

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,959
more towards the GUI and that for the

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:48,010
command line but it's very very similar

00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,329
idea so there are simple programs that

00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,940
can take some input it take some output

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,500
and do some things with them and their

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,790
contextual so they can only do certain

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,620
things at certain times and normally so

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,970
you can you can write these services and

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:04,019
all sorts of things one way to do it is

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:06,010
to use oh there's an automator

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,320
application that started coming with OS

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,049
10 a few releases ago this service is a

00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,420
way of doing of writing simple services

00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:17,979
in your favorite scripting language

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:22,030
including pearl that's the website to

00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:24,240
find it waffle software they have a

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,890
couple of other a few other interesting

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,370
applications on that site to the idea

00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,870
for this

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,710
came from John Gruber if you've ever

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:38,800
heard of he's a big big name in the back

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:40,210
in touch world and as I said the idea is

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,620
that you write services in your favorite

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,830
scripting language and it supports Perl

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:49,210
and Python and Ruby and Apple script and

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:51,280
I think javascript is well nowadays and

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,490
it comes with some sample programs but

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,690
they're so simple that it's not it some

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,830
shells but they're so simple that if you

00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,260
know pearl you don't even really need to

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,479
look at that so this is where we're

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:05,350
going to go into a live demo part of the

00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:08,080
talk and so can you read that you guys

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:13,570
in the back can read it okay this is

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,460
very very simple program so we're

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,260
starting pearl here the one thing you

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,910
might not be familiar with is this dash

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,930
C capital C capital I capitulo and

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:30,070
anyone know what that means Rick knows

00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:31,210
what that means I bet though it does

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,289
that mean that it can only be run by

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,450
particular people in your company that

00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:36,910
means this means the capital C has to do

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,880
with Unicode options that means that it

00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,289
can take unicode characters in and write

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,490
unicode characters out because we're

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:45,520
going to be doing tech stuff and they

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,870
might potentially be unicode i actually

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,950
to be honest i've ran it on some simple

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,650
things without that and it worked just

00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:53,560
fine as well and then all this is going

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,599
to do is a very simple loop where it's

00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,680
going to read all the input and convert

00:05:55,599 --> 00:06:03,280
everything from lowercase to uppercase

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:05,500
between a and Z right so when we run

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:10,030
this so I've saved this in my bin

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:13,210
directory so we start up this service

00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:15,699
and so if you down if you downloaded you

00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:19,810
just drag it to to your applications

00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:21,190
directory it's very very simple and I've

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,400
already playing with this last site as

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,410
you can see but um so we're going to

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,840
call the service we're going to call the

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:32,020
service yap see just for the heck of it

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,180
you can you can pick where you can pick

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,650
it pick it from there so it's very

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,650
simple for standard dialog box

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:46,510
there's some things under options the

00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,340
most interesting thing here is to

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,900
include it by reference if you do that

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,280
then if you change it you don't have to

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,280
recompute you don't have to go through

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,180
this process again it'll just be there

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,650
otherwise you would have to go through

00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,990
and reinstall it every time you make a

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:02,140
change so just say we want to test the

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:05,790
service okay this is because I did this

00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:10,260
already but we're just gonna know it's

00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:20,260
okay so let's write some text ABC dog

00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:24,130
cat and it converted its upper case so

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,870
it's pretty pretty simple but so once

00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:27,280
once you've tested it in here I mean

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,840
obviously this is it eager to all of you

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,980
obviously do much much more testing in

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,780
pro but this is a very simple way of

00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,180
just making sure that it's working so

00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:38,860
what you've done that you say finish and

00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:42,610
sit so now once you've done that you can

00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,590
go to a window like this and whatever

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:48,940
you've height so we highlight some

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:51,760
things we go to under the services menu

00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,200
which is hiding under the it's always

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,160
the first thing after the Apple menu

00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,730
it's going to be under there and if we

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:05,620
just click on the Yap see service here

00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:08,050
it will make the upper case yay and it's

00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:11,770
contextual so if there's if there's

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:14,020
nothing highlighted then no services

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,640
apply if it's only ever going to do it

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,620
for what's been highlighted so we only

00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:22,920
do those that will only actually lets

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,920
them back

00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:36,419
okay so for this is really about all

00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:38,760
that there is to it but let's let's do a

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:46,470
slightly more complex example so suppose

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:50,820
we have yes yes you can you can bind

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:54,750
command keys to it as well believe the

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,839
way you do that is through the

00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:10,980
preference of the keyboard preferences

00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:13,860
so if you go ok now the time that's a

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:20,240
that's an excellent question how do I

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:20,240
get this over I can make this smaller

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:32,840
there we go okay so this is here's a

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,280
little quote and numb suppose suppose

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,720
you're doing this in latex this is just

00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,130
a sample thing so I did a lot I wrote a

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,470
lot of late echoed when I was working on

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,940
my dissertation and so anyone written

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,610
late echoed you know how like it gets

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:47,150
very wordy right and if you wanted to

00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:55,160
make this be emphasized you would have

00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:57,590
to say / en pH that and that and I can

00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,630
tell you that doing that over and over

00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,190
again is kind of a pain in the butt and

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,140
your wrists start hurting and you start

00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,760
you know thinking about you might be

00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,890
getting carpal tunnel syndrome or things

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,660
like that so it would be really nice if

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,600
you could do something that was a bit

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,570
more like marked down or you could just

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,190
say that put the things in quotes in an

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,210
asterisk and convert it to em pauta

00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,680
matically and that's also easy to do

00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:25,400
with the service if I go back to where I

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,850
was before and I already saved what I

00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,850
want to do

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,620
and I'll just leave that there so this

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,240
is this is it kind of complicated but

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,880
it's just going to look for an asterisk

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,400
a bunch of non asterisks and then

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,310
another asterisk and have the stuff in

00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,230
between the asterisks in in parentheses

00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,920
so I'm going to take that input Annie

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:02,630
mph around it so does that make sense so

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,950
I want to save that and I don't have to

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,130
do anything with this service anymore

00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:10,130
and now if i go back to wear over here

00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:17,210
and i highlight the whole thing and i

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:21,260
say hi i made it all uppercase but but

00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:22,100
you get the idea right so I don't you

00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,220
can think about all the different things

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,750
you do I have lots of macros that are

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,860
like that in Emacs but it would be nice

00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,270
to be able to do stuff like that if you

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,980
don't have emacs or you know that if

00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,810
you're just in something like text

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:36,020
wrangler or things like that dinner to

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:44,360
do these so um I don't have any any

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:47,210
questions about this yes oh I didn't

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:51,860
really have to do any all the magic is

00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:56,360
is in this service the service program

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:59,030
which you would download from from what

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:04,420
was the name of I think waffle waffle

00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:04,420
that waffle house but waffle software

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:12,260
you go in you go into that you give the

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:16,750
service a name you use this thing to

00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:19,730
find the script and you choose it and

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,530
you test it and then okay before you

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,780
test it you make sure that there's an

00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,100
option that says include script by

00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,060
reference because then it just knows

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,280
where it is and it's going to run

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,230
whatever's there and then once you've

00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,640
done that and you test it and install it

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,050
then it just sort of knows that it's

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:39,980
there and whatever you changes or kind

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:41,390
of could it yes no no it does not need

00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,450
to take running this service just

00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:48,370
installs it and some magic internal to

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:51,320
it will will make sure that it's there

00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,560
in fact it's kind of hard to get rid of

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,470
this

00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:57,650
services once you've installed them so

00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:00,140
that's another caveat so there are some

00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:02,840
tools which I honestly have not tried to

00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:06,260
use called what was the closing one you

00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,820
said service scrubber to help get rid of

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,620
love because it sort of makes settings

00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,070
all around so it's a little tricky to

00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:16,370
get rid of them okay so let me move on

00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:24,680
to to my next topic before I run out of

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:26,270
time here ok the other thing I want to

00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,279
want to talk about with FS events does

00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:32,720
anyone know in a familiar with FS events

00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:35,270
a little bit they went try to to UM so I

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,830
run a um so I do back up so it's very

00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,890
important to backups obviously so I do

00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:42,890
backups both on my linux box at home and

00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,210
on my Mac here when I run so you can use

00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,880
type this thing called time machine on

00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,830
your Mac where you can plug it in you

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,120
just plug in an external drive in every

00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,040
hour it back so if anything has changed

00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,070
in last hour and typically it takes just

00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,660
a few minutes to do that when i run

00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,070
backups on my linux box which is roughly

00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,010
the same amount of storage in it it

00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:04,100
takes about four it takes about an hour

00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,660
to run takes maybe 45 minutes to run so

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,460
why is it why does it take so long to

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,460
run on linux and so why can they do it

00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:14,510
so quickly on a mac and the the trick is

00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,740
this this service called FS events as i

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:17,030
said it's the basis of time machine it's

00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,760
also a spotlight so it knows immediately

00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:21,560
when files have been changed and the way

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,960
it does that is it tracks directories

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,640
that have been changed and so so it's

00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,550
something internal to the file system so

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,290
f s H of S Plus is just monitoring every

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,260
time file system every time the

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,240
directory gets changes change and that's

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,130
available to users so user programs can

00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,300
also know immediately when when

00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:42,709
particular directories have changed and

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,170
through Pearl we can access them through

00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:49,910
a module called Mac colon colon FS

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:54,860
events and make sure you I'm not done

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:57,520
yet so i'll show you how that works over

00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,520
here

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:08,610
okay so so we use Mac colon colon SMS

00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,110
events when we there's a number of

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:13,410
options this is a simplest way of using

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:15,180
it you tell it what path to monitor so

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,710
I'm going to monitor under my home

00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,170
directory and then a test directory

00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:23,750
inside inside the home direct my home to

00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:27,390
her and then you start watching it and

00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:29,370
then you loop forever over this and

00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,840
every time there's events to be read

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,840
it's going to return out of this

00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,400
otherwise it's going to block and then

00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,780
it loops through them and it's going to

00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,280
get the path out of that and I'm just

00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,680
going to say when something's happened

00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,690
I'm also going to growl when something's

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,820
happened so what I call when I use growl

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,680
notify that you can download that from

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,210
the grout from growls website and it'll

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,890
make a growl notification when

00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,180
something's change and it's good and the

00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,370
notification I'm going to include just

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:57,930
as a test here is the name of the pet of

00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:59,220
the path that's changed so hopefully

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,620
that's three for you can this is all

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,860
right from the the documentation for Mac

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:12,300
comical and fs events so let's go over

00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:19,970
here and I probably hit mean smoother

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:19,970
window why don't that one the other one

00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,360
ok so now that's running and it's

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:44,590
waiting for me to change things in here

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:47,200
so let's just say touch foo so I don't

00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:51,070
know where the growl event was but it

00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:53,820
did come up here if I remove it which is

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,820
a little low

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:21,070
right so even even though only

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,750
monitoring this one I what I did here

00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:25,120
was make another directory called ABC

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,650
and now it says something's changed

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,840
inside that so it's going to look for

00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:31,510
every directory under from there and on

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,650
down and so this is really just like a

00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,180
shell that show you what you do but you

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,680
could have this if something gets

00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,620
uploaded into a particular directory

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,700
kick off some kick up some jobs to you

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,350
know maybe you want to kick off a

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,360
compile of your system when a file has

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,780
changed in it or something like that so

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,160
um I don't know so you can probably

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:53,890
think of all sorts of applications to do

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:58,810
with that anyway so that was where it

00:17:53,890 --> 00:18:01,120
was okay so that's really all that I

00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:15,160
want to cover so anybody have any other

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:17,020
questions yes okay in case you didn't

00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,600
hear that Mike said that he uses FS

00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,840
events to take new screenshots off the

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,510
desktop and automatically upload them to

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,710
to wear to your linode of course of

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,710
course where else are they upload them

00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:32,740
but yeah I guess I my intention of doing

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:35,440
this was just to give you some ideas of

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,640
thing of some modules and things tools

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,020
that you might not to be aware of and

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:44,100
then you can think of other other

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:44,100
applications for them anyone else yes

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,390
other other things that they can do is

00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,630
that service is that basically what a

00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:59,390
services the ability to modify input or

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:06,280
going to do other stuff I guess it can

00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:06,280
do anything that the yeah um

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,330
right yeah they don't have to have input

00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,940
an apple they could have just input or

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,650
just output you could have so somebody

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,330
as an example of just output might take

00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,190
something out of the clipboard and do

00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,440
some massaging to it and then insert it

00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,900
into a text window that you're in and

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,470
there they don't have to just be text

00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:32,260
they could be an image they could be I

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,540
mean any sort of any sort of a system

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,190
objects that could young sorts of things

00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:43,179
you could put into a clipboard or B

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:47,830
would be available to them you could do

00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:49,960
that too yeah the somebody is somebody

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:53,049
named Brent terpstra has done a whole

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,640
bunch of services dealing with mark down

00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:56,980
and converting them to HTML and doing

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,340
sorts of clever things with that one of

00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:04,299
the services i use has to do with um

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:06,070
text reformatting so often if you're if

00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:07,780
you're copying text out of the email

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:11,049
like I often was maintaining of

00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:13,570
calendars for talks talks lists at

00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:15,220
Drexel and often when you when you when

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:18,220
you cut into pay something out of an

00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:20,140
email and put it into a calendar the the

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,910
line breaks end up in odd places and so

00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,400
this just removes all the all the hard

00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:26,290
line breaks and lets it flow sort of

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,120
naturally in the text box that it's in

00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:31,049
so things like that so simple things are

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,049
really useful for that yes

00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:40,529
there are lots of titles and URLs I

00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:44,389
select all and i get a service will

00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:44,389
actually send all those the pocket or

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,549
yeah they can do all sorts of

00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,720
interesting things in terms of like your

00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:56,100
workflow if you're working with a number

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,960
of different applications and tying them

00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,299
together and save me the time of cutting

00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,590
cutting something here pacing if you're

00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,299
massaging it and putting it someplace

00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:13,739
else so you could have services automate

00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:15,149
that part of it yeah I don't think you

00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:21,149
really can I mean it's just really just

00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:22,409
going to be what you've selected I'm not

00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:23,909
sure you can get any kind of property

00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:26,419
right hook about prompts or sister

00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:26,419
promise sir

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,840
yeah I probably yeah it probably could

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,760
do yeah it probably do things like that

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,030
I don't you'd have to use you have you

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:57,799
some you'd have to get it to pop up a

00:21:47,030 --> 00:22:03,610
window somehow I don't know yet so I

00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:03,610
think I think I'm out of time so thanks

00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:41,170
