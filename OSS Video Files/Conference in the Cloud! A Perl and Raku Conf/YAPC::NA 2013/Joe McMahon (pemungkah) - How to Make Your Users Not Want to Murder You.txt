	00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,319
so we are going to talk today

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,440
about having your users not want to

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,000
murder you

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,440
uh and i have changed the subtitles

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,759
slightly we are talking

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,480
talking specifically about engineering

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,760
software psychology

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,320
so first laziness laziness is

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,199
the willingness to put in ridiculous

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,240
amounts of work

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,840
now to not have to do work later so that

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,599
that will be my criterion for being

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,680
lazy

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,040
so psycho psychological engineering

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,360
psychological engineering is

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,879
is not the kind that you're seeing on on

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,399
the right hand side there we're talking

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,160
about the kind

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,920
it's not how to get things done it's not

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,600
we're going to use svn we're going to

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,879
use this particular

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,920
this particular package we're going to

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,320
use this particular platform it's about

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,480
i want to make sure that i did stuff so

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,600
that things are not going to break

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,920
i want to have the user say oh i

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,719
love this software so much is i'm so

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,000
happy with this

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,040
it's fantastic i totally trust it that's

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,680
the kind of engineering

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,400
we're doing here this is engineering

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,640
that says yes

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,240
i don't have to worry about okay i'm

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,119
going to drive over this bridge and it's

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,119
going to fall down

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,320
and first question people always ask me

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,360
about this well isn't this all that

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,200
user experience stuff well it's kind of

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,080
the user experience stuff

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,600
but what we're really doing here is not

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,320
saying okay we're going to put together

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,079
you know

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,600
this is this particular user who wants

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,840
to use the system this way

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,960
to do this stuff we're specifically

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,040
going to have

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,400
tools and things we're going to think

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,479
about to say

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,600
this is the way we're going to approach

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,759
the problem

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,880
this is the way we're going to look at

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,680
what's happening

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,960
so that we communicate the information

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,960
that the user needs to have

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,920
this is a very soft approach to

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,000
programming as opposed to a

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,119
nuts and bolts we'll use this tool

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,880
approach

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,759
we're going to say what our criteria

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,560
are or not do our tests pass but do our

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,160
users have

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,200
warm fuzzies about the software or do

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,599
they have cold precludes

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,480
we want to give them cues which are

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,640
implicit communication and messages

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,720
which are explicit communication

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,680
about the software to make them have

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,680
those warm fuzzies

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,599
we are going to try to manage their

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,519
expectations

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:38,720
of what the software will do won't do

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,720
can do can't do

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,879
every everybody's seen this one before

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,400
unix is very user friendly

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,480
just very selective about who its

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,519
friends are so

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,000
we're gonna try to not do that we want

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,120
to have

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,879
our software be friendly enough that

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,519
people can say okay yeah fine i can

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,519
trust this

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,440
if i type in this thing it's going to

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,480
tell me you did something wrong

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,519
here's what's wrong not oh your files

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,519
are gone now have haven't i say

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,200
good programming is not

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,159
exactly equivalent to good soft science

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,879
engineering

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,800
you can be a fantastic programmer do a

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,239
great job

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,239
engineers tend to build stuff that's

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,599
really safe for engineers

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,360
hey you know if you know how it works

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,879
it's perfectly safe you know there's no

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,120
problem with the

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,239
with the dash rf stuff you just don't do

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,400
it in route

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,840
so what we are trying to do here is

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,440
balancing

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,200
being useful for experts and

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,360
safe for people who are not experts at

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,360
all

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,200
an example the iphone is

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,239
pretty much safe to use you know you tap

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,640
on things

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,519
it's pretty hard to break stuff there is

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,439
an option

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,720
to erase the entire contents of the

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,360
iphone you have to drill down

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,480
into settings pick a specific thing in

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,200
settings

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,480
hit the big red button that says erase

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,799
everything

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,920
go through two separate prompts that say

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,680
you're going to erase everything

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,599
seriously do you really want to do this

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,000
i mean really seriously do you want to

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,920
do this

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,799
and then it will do the bad thing and

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,240
erase all of your stuff

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,960
this is an example of good software

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,960
psychology

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,520
we're going to do a case study today on

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,759
www.mechanize and

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,880
a failure of software psychology

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,960
i would first like to say that www

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,320
mechanized is one of my favorite things

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,600
in the entire world

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,160
it got me a job it kept me a job

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,880
i love it to death the people who wrote

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,520
it are very very smart people

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,560
but what we're going to talk about is

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,160
one

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,440
tiny failure in thinking that led

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,400
to a series of problems

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,240
in the real world for for users so

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,000
everybody in the world has seen this

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,800
you create a mech object you get some

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,960
url you check success and

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,880
you know that's very standard kind of

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,720
stuff it's very pearlish

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,880
ask try to do something see if it worked

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,919
this was the way it worked forever and

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,080
forever

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:27,759
up until 1.4901

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,280
at that point there was a change

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,919
the change was as noted in the change

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,240
log

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,280
and as an aside users never read the

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,199
change logs

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,440
ever ever ever do they read the change

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,960
logs so but in the changelog

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,800
we have this note about things that may

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,479
break your code

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,479
we emphasize may and

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,240
we'll notice you've been getting so many

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,560
new programmers

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,080
this is a good thing we're trying to

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,199
look at the new people who are coming in

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,280
and saying okay

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,319
we want to fix things we want to serve

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,560
the problem

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,600
so they're calling get and then they

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,440
never check the

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,720
check the results so say oh well you

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,160
know this is a problem

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,800
so we're putting on the seat belts for

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,240
them okay

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,800
what are the seat belts well the seat

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,800
belts are

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,600
and this is translating it into the

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,319
actual reality as opposed to the text it

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,840
was

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,199
these are the things that are completely

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,120
going to break your code that was

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,160
working perfectly fine for no obvious

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,280
reason

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,800
and what's going to happen is

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:37,440
when you do a get request if it fails

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,440
the code will die okay

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,000
engineering decision so that means that

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,160
this canonical example

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,919
the one that's documented everywhere the

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,639
one that's in spidering hacks

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,680
the one that's in pearl cookbook this

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,720
example

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,400
is gonna die that

00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:00,080
is a psychological engineering

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,520
problem because all of a sudden this

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,080
code you've been running for months

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,080
doesn't work

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,440
except when it does continue to work

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,639
because if you've subclassed

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:19,440
www mechanize then the auto check uh

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,199
code is skipped so it works the way it

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,240
used to work before

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,400
this is an inconsistency inconsistencies

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,960
are always bad because inconsistencies

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,960
mean

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,720
cold prickly cold prickly's we don't

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,720
want we want to find a different way to

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,160
do this

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,280
the error message is this error getting

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,560
some url

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:44,080
and whatever the reason was timeout 404

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,520
whatever which is a fantastically

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,160
correct message it's

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,680
technically accurate you did a get

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,720
request

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,960
and timed out what it is

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,240
is psychologically incomplete we don't

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,080
know why

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,520
this suddenly happened it never happened

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,960
before why am i suddenly getting this

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,639
message now

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,120
why is my code broken what happened to

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,120
my code

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,280
so this is the classic sudden surprise

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,280
result

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,720
we don't ever want a sudden surprise

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,319
result

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,639
working code in production is now broken

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,639
code

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,879
it's also only broken in an exceptional

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,280
situation if the get fails

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,120
then the code fails so you've got a

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,640
situation where are you saying okay well

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,919
hey i have this quick diagnostic i need

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,560
to run to see make sure everything's

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,399
working

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,839
i'll get this url that should happen and

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,599
this should happen this should happen

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,519
this should happen

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,240
so you get the first one you get the

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,920
second one where there's a problem

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,440
and instead of getting the message

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,560
saying okay well second thing didn't

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,839
happen we need to check

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,519
three four and five it dies on two and

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,640
okay it's two am my code is dying

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,640
where's the damn system

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,519
so this can often happen in the

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,600
situation where you have

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,440
person a who writes a bunch of scripts

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,680
and just wants to get stuff done

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
and person b who's the one who has to

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,360
maintain the machine

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,120
so okay i'm going to install the new

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,880
version of www.recognized because i got

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,160
this bug i need to fix

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,120
and three weeks later somebody else

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
calls you up at three o'clock in the

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,680
morning says

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,000
my script that checks to see why

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,279
production is having a problem

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,680
is breaking what did you do we never

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,480
want to have that happen

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,480
but you know

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,760
this gotta be well maybe we just didn't

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,560
get the message out

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,000
um does anybody remember this one with

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,360
the iphone 4.

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,600
uh this is this is a classic

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,959
misstep in the other direction by a

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,000
company that doesn't often

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,320
do this which is to say

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,600
well you know you you've been doing

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,720
something the way you've always been

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,920
doing it before you've been holding your

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,360
phone to your ear

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,040
or now you hold your phone to the ear

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,600
just exactly the way you did before

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,240
now your phone doesn't work well you're

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,560
holding the phone wrong

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,800
this is the wrong answer the answer

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,640
ended up actually being the free case

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,360
program if anybody remembers that where

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,440
apple had to give

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,800
everybody a free case because of the

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,839
antenna problem

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:34,000
so everything was great

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,399
with back to www. everything was great

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,279
as long as everything was working fine

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,760
you did it get

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,279
you got a successful result fantastic

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,640
everything's good

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,959
and then when the get failed you had

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,040
this problem which is all of a sudden

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,279
your code was broken

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,760
but surely this is you know this was

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,360
really straightened out no problem right

00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,240
okay well um the date here is april 19

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,640
2012. this is four years after the

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,640
release

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,079
and why is it that my gap doesn't work

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,079
it dies

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:17,040
and again on stack overflow

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,240
same problem this is fortunately

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,320
the latest one you could find that was

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,959
june 4th 2012 but that's still

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,959
four years

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,320
and that is the big question why did it

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,720
take four years

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,640
to get this message out it doesn't seem

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,519
all that complicated

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,360
um it doesn't make any sense to a

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,279
programmer i put it in the documentation

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,440
what's the problem

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,760
the www mechanized cookbook had this in

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,839
day one you should use

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,320
auto check zero if you want to use mech

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,320
success

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,079
the other question is why did this

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,360
happen at all why did we ever get into

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,600
the situation where this

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,200
this happened why didn't we get the

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,839
message across

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:06,000
and why did it take so long

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,000
for people to actually get this message

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,839
well part one was indeed caused by

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,959
success www mechanized was

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,320
so incredibly awesome you just used it

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:24,000
it worked it was fantastic it was

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,160
so good you used it for everything

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,519
and of course that meant that it was all

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,160
over the place

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,800
in lots of scripts some that got ran all

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,120
the time

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,079
some that got ran you know every once in

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,639
a while

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,279
when something went wrong every three

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,519
four five

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,519
six months and

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,839
so not a problem you know we'll just

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,959
we'll just do our stuff and it gets

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,279
updated and wait a minute

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,320
this script broke and then a month and a

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,720
half later

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,399
this other script is broken and then

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,760
another three months later this script

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,760
is broken

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,480
so again too much complacency too much

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,000
awesome

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,240
we just figured it's always going to

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,240
work

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,279
when we had a previous major-ish change

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,600
to mac

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,800
it was saying take things that you

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,279
should have been doing

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,959
before and make them mandatory you have

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,120
to do them now

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,800
it was saying take deprecated features

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,680
that have already been deprecated

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,040
and take them away now notice that we

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,480
are saying

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,320
making things that you should have been

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,760
doing already

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,600
mandatory we have this window

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,880
of deprecation

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,760
the change again this is a quoting from

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,560
the changelog

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,639
it's saying this seems like a good place

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,320
to go to 1.0

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:51,440
this is an important psychological

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,279
a barrier going from o dot something to

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,240
one dot something you're saying

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,880
i have done something big i have gone

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,839
from

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,519
version x to version y that means

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,199
something big must have changed

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:08,720
i should pay more attention this is a

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,720
expectation management

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,120
the other thing was is that the way this

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,040
particular change was done

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,600
they removed a variable and if you tried

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,360
to

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,040
just go ahead and use that and you had

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,279
used strict on then u-strict would cause

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,360
you to fail at compile time

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,800
so you got a much earlier warning saying

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,680
hey you have a potential problem with

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,199
your script

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,360
rather than okay it's been running for

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:37,199
two and a half hours and you get failed

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,199
oh well so much for that

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,680
this is in the case of the youth strict

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,240
thing

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,440
an applied use of cold preclease you

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,800
want to have that

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,880
start the script and also the script

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,320
just dies

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,639
you want to look at it right now rather

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,120
than okay well it'll run it you'll run

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,720
it

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,279
at midnight and i'll see what happens in

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,440
the morning

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,959
complacency part two out of date

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,519
documentation

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,320
not the dub dub dub mechanized docs but

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,360
every other

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,480
printed documentation in the world

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,680
was saying oh you need to do it

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,279
with uh with just this mech success

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,160
that's perfectly fine the cookbook had

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,720
it day one

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,480
that was the right the right thing but

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,120
all the books

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,560
didn't have it so if you went to the

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,079
pearl cookbook and said well what's the

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,600
right way to do this before cookbook

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,079
said you need to use mech success

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,639
because

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,639
that'll work

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,880
and uh unfortunately

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,079
www mechanized example still doesn't

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,680
have auto check

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,079
one on all of its examples in fact

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,279
only two out of the ten examples use

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,399
auto check one

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,800
all the other ones don't so again if

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,079
you're

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,160
just scanning through and say oh here's

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,880
a sample program i'll use that you won't

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,240
get the

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,880
i should be using autojet

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,120
google results are out of date here's

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,240
here's an example google on

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,639
looking for mech success all of these

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,480
guys

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,880
except for the mechanized pm1

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,800
don't mention that you need to turn auto

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,759
check off

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,480
if you do a search for www.mechanized

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,000
example

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,040
and take out ruby because there are

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,320
craploads of ruby examples

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,600
there are 176 thousand hits

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,560
most of them still don't turn off auto

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,759
check

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,360
and they use mech success so

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:41,519
we have craploads of bad examples

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,519
of how to do things wrong

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,800
so summarizing the psychological

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,120
failures we had

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,240
no lead up to the change in the code we

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,160
went from

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,560
148 where we didn't have auto check at

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,560
all to 149 which was like

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,639
okay auto text on have a good time with

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,639
it

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,839
we didn't have any meta messaging

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,039
saying you need to be aware that there's

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,199
a problem here

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,079
that's different from what happened when

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,600
you were running your code yesterday

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,720
we didn't have any way to

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,280
easily map from i got this thing that

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,640
said

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,880
the get failed what am i supposed to do

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,880
now

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,760
we didn't have a case where the common

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,400
sense

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,320
use case was the one that was most

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,840
likely to be broken the one that was the

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,919
most commonly

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,280
seen in documentation the one that was a

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,720
canonical example

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,120
was the one that was most likely to be

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,520
broken

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,400
so this is essentially how everybody

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,480
felt when

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,640
when that turned around at least where i

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,400
was working which was yahoo

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,080
when we put out 14901

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,840
essentially this is what happened the

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,960
phone rang off the hook everybody's

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,919
scripts were broken

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,160
what's going on why did you break pearl

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,320
and so on

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,200
so that was pretty much how everybody

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,320
felt

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,320
about the process

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,240
so the importance is we've got to figure

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,200
out a way

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,960
to communicate this is the primary job

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,360
of psychological engineering is figuring

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,320
out

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,120
how to get the message across that you

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,120
need to get across

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,640
everybody has to get the message

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,840
most of the other sources are saying no

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,600
no no no this is the right way to do it

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,520
but you made a change how do you make

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,400
that work how do you make this happen so

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,520
that

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,679
you don't have this miscommunication

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,039
you've got to get that out to a whole

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,360
bunch of people how do you make that

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,360
happen

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,840
let's not skip tool number one that's

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,480
really important incrementing the major

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,840
version

00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:01,200
is tool number one if you have a

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,640
big change that you can't go through a

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,520
deprecation cycle for

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,760
you have to do it now it makes a major

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,000
change to the way the api works

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,039
you've got to bump the major version

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,520
this is this is that

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,520
meta signal that says something

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,840
important has happened in

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,640
behind brain of all the people who are

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,760
using your module says oh wait

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,280
1.0 to 2.0 that's probably that's

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,960
probably significant maybe i should go

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,600
read the documentation

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,600
this time

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:40,240
number two accurately and completely

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,720
diagnose failures so that you have that

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,919
psychological completion of

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,960
this happened this is what's wrong

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,679
this is what to do so this is a rewrite

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,280
of the of the error message says error

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,160
getting such and such

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,240
page not found and then you didn't

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,320
specify auto check and new

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,080
you should use auto check one if you

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,240
want to check status yourself

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:09,520
or if i got that backwards anyway again

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,360
a messaging problem but the idea is to

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,080
make sure that you have said

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,480
this is what you want to do to fix your

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,480
problem

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,320
number three add a warning

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,640
it says you have done something

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,880
that could conceivably bite you i'm

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,640
going to tell you about it now

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,400
assuming that you probably know what

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,640
you're doing

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,240
so here we go i've done a www mechanized

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,200
new without sending auto check user to

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,200
one or zero

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,080
it says you have a non-subclass

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,559
www.mechanize object

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,080
we are now defaulting that to autocheck

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,520
one

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,120
and that should be enough for somebody

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,960
to say what autocheck

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,440
what does autocheck 1 mean and at least

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,360
go look at the documentation

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,880
so this is this is a case of giving

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:02,080
somebody the cold prickly's

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:06,000
for a good reason

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,240
number four add an inconvenient hack

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,640
that lets the old code continue to work

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,159
so here's an example you have a new

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,320
environment variable that says i am

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,200
ignoring the auto check requirement

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,039
if that's set to true then mechanized

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,919
new continues to work the old way

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,400
as if auto check never existed at all so

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,559
the

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,400
code that was working continues to work

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,000
we make it a long and complicated

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,240
variable name so that

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,039
is so much of a pain in the ass that

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,039
people

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,799
don't say well this is the way i'll fix

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,000
all my production scripts i'll

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,000
actually go back and fix them

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,480
and of course we also give a warning

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
saying hey by the way we overrode

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,919
autocheck one so they'll get another

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,600
meta message a little poke another

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,880
little cold prickly maybe i'm not doing

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,679
the right thing

00:21:52,880 --> 00:22:00,720
to say i should fix this sometime

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:04,000
and number five and

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,080
this is a good thing to do

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,440
but again it's number five on the list

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,520
because it actually

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,120
doesn't work as well as the other ones

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,480
which is to put in

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,600
very obvious documentation

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,640
it was right to put the change in the

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,200
change log

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,039
but it should have been in big block

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,480
letters

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:30,559
in the perl doc at the top to say

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:33,440
there has been an important api change

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,400
prior to anything in the usage section

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,559
make sure

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,080
it is absolutely clear use the code

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,559
properly in the synopsis

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,520
there has been a change this is it you

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,520
need to do this

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:50,960
so let's do a quick analysis

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,360
of dub dub to mechanize and say so what

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,400
was

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,520
the source of failure here

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,120
how did this happen why didn't all of

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:04,320
these good ideas

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,320
get implemented in the 14901 change

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,320
and the first one is probably

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,799
perspective

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,159
from the same point of view of the

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:16,320
maintainers of dub dub

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:19,200
mechanize the problem was not

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,720
anything else other than lots of people

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,640
are writing to me and saying

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,480
dub dub dub mechanized doesn't work

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,120
because i did a get and i didn't get any

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,400
page and i don't know what's wrong

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:33,919
so the perspective was i need to solve

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,960
this problem that i have which is

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:40,000
a mailbox full of stuff that is

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,880
to me irrelevant so i'll make a fix so i

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,559
don't get those emails anymore

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,000
so making the fix to get not get the

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,360
emails

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,120
fix that problem but it caused

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,120
a whole different other set of problems

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,799
unintended consequences this particular

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,400
graphic

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,840
is a picture of erosion caused by

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,840
rabbits in australia

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:09,200
um when they brought in rabbits who knew

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,960
that this is what robots would cause

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,960
indirectly but

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,640
so we were looking for um

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,400
a way to solve that problem of i have a

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,080
problem that i can't get my work done

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,440
because i'm continuously answering

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,000
emails to people saying

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:32,880
put in you know mech success to make

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,640
sure that you get worked because

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:40,400
that fixed that problem it was good

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:43,679
but because it broke existing old code

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,080
without a clear path to this is how i

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,120
fix

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,760
my old code we had an unintended

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,760
consequence

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,720
so let's talk a little bit about the

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,960
basis

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,960
for psychological engineering

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:07,520
i have to properly prepare

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,919
the audience that you want to talk to

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,360
you have to be able to say this is what

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,880
i'm going to be

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,200
doing this is what's going to be

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,480
happening

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,520
you have to deploy it in a way that

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,039
allows

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,559
the change to work its way in

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,720
and not cause any problems in the

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:31,039
process

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:34,080
you need to provide diagnosis

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,480
to your users when the problem

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,600
occurs to be able to say this is how it

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,080
went wrong

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,799
this is what you need to do this is how

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,080
you need to fix it

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:49,840
and last you have to give them a last

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,679
ditch rescue operation

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,880
if your code can't be changed because

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,480
it's in production and you

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,840
really really really need to get it

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,840
fixed you can do this

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,720
so what we're trying to do is both

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,080
protect the people that we're writing

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,880
the software for

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,480
and communicate to them at the same time

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,480
something is about to happen

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,159
it's a change you're going to need to

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,480
make changes

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,080
but i'm giving you all this information

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,919
i'm letting you know

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,720
i want you to be able to feel like you

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,720
can trust me

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,760
so preparing when you're about to make a

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,480
change

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,200
you need to blog about it you need to

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,400
email

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,240
your users and say hey by the way we're

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,400
going to make this change this is how it

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:41,039
works this is how it all works out

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,520
this is what you have to do to work with

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,120
the new

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,440
with the new code so that everything

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,279
that you have now continues to work

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,600
put it out on twitter put it out on

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,679
mailing lists put it out on

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,640
pearlmonks any other website you can

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,840
think of

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,240
that your users are going to read you

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,400
just

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,760
need to make sure that everybody sees it

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,480
and do it more than once

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,279
because if you do it only once people

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,120
just say oh yeah

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:10,400
whatever and skip it

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,400
when it comes to deployment

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,400
you have to have it in the change log in

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,039
your man pages

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,000
in your check-in comments and most

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,840
importantly

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,440
in your error messages having your error

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,039
messages say

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:32,399
this problem was caused by this change

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:32,399
do this to fix it is very very very

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,440
important

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,200
one other item if you can possibly have

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,640
a deprecation cycle

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,880
do it if you can say okay in

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,960
the release after this one we're going

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,640
to change over from having

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,559
this situation where you have to use

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,320
mech success to check your gets

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:56,480
to us dying if your gut fails

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,080
and we'll warn you in this release and

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,720
then the next release is going to take

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,480
take effect diagnosis you have to

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,200
show the error as early as you possibly

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,480
can if you can do it at compile time

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,760
do it at compile time if you

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,600
can't do it there then try to do it when

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,799
the object is created

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,919
if you can't do it there then

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,960
be as exact as you possibly can be when

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,960
an error actually occurs

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,799
and last give them a way out if there's

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,600
a situation where they just absolutely

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,679
can't change their code

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,360
give them a give them an example like

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,039
this i am ignoring the mac auto check

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,039
requirement

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,399
it's a way for them to be able to get

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,320
past

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,000
okay look i need to fix this tomorrow

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,320
but right now i need to get the script

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,320
to run

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,279
so basically what we're saying is make

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,279
the situation obvious

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,360
you have to know what it is you have to

00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,840
know

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,720
how to fix it in the short term you need

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,120
to know how to fix it in the long term

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,320
and you need to know what the fallback

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,760
is if it is possible to have one

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,080
this is all more work for you but

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,919
since you're lazy you're perfectly

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,799
willing to put in this work now

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,799
so you don't have to do work later at 3

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,320
o'clock in the morning

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,279
so i wrote a post on pro monks about

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,880
this

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:30,880
and realistically speaking

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,399
most people actually didn't agree with

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,520
me

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,960
um it was it was really it was really

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,840
quite fascinating i

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,640
i you know i put this out and they rep

00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,080
people are saying

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,120
oh you're cuddling your users

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,520
and that is a that is a classic

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:55,760
i'm just a software developer you know

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:58,320
this this psychological stuff is

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,960
the psychological stuff is very

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,960
important

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:05,919
coddling is a good thing to do

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,559
particularly in the situation that we're

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,880
in here

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,080
we've got dub dub mechanized which is

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,240
widely used

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,000
i mean it's one of the one of the things

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,279
that a lot of people know even if they

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,320
don't know anything else about pearl

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,799
they know about w mechanize

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,399
uh it's one of the really good things

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,120
it's one of the things that people say

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,039
yeah

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,799
that's a great module i just used it and

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:36,559
it worked it was fantastic

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:38,320
and it made me feel good about pearl

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,320
there's a new version of mechanized

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,480
install that and that goes by and you

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,919
never see it

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:50,640
and the classic case is sometimes

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:54,159
maybe you're just not very smart

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,799
and that is that includes

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,399
me being not very smart because when

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,679
it's this time

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:03,519
i am not very smart i'm running at maybe

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,799
about 60 percent

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,720
and i want to code so

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,440
the sixty percent me at two o'clock in

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,519
the morning can look at the code and say

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,120
oh right it's obvious what the problem

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,519
is here not be

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:22,640
okay what was it what did i do

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,000
where's some coffee it's 3 30. people

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,720
are calling me on the phone saying why

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,399
is the site not

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,840
up okay i don't want that to be the case

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,600
i want it to just be

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:37,039
oh fine i know what the problem is here

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,600
so here's an example so when people say

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,080
well

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,480
come on that's not that's you know just

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,240
just suck it up you're tired

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,279
here's an example from a flight safety

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,200
problem

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,200
uh the flight officer fell asleep he was

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,279
asleep for longer than

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,600
the um mandated time the mandated time

00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,600
for

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,360
a flight officer on an airplane to take

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,880
a nap is about 20 minutes

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,799
because you can wake back up from that

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,960
and be fairly refreshed he fell asleep

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,600
for 75 minutes he woke up

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,120
he was disoriented he wasn't feeling

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,840
very well

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:16,240
he mistook the planet venus for another

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,760
aircraft and then when he realized no

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,200
wait that's not the other aircraft this

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,000
is the other aircraft because his lights

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,559
are blinking

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,880
he thought it was above them so he put

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,320
the plane into a dive

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,760
four people got injured this is not

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,320
because he was incompetent

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:37,440
it was because he was tired you need to

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,960
budget for not only

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,559
your users but yourself

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,960
this is psychological engineering for

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,960
yourself

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:51,360
so let's talk a little bit about

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,039
usability so

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,120
when an error occurs there are several

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,159
things you can do

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,200
nothing the error just happens and your

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,240
program

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,080
happily chugs on and later on

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,440
when all the bits start falling from the

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,720
ceiling you realize okay well

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:13,600
gee there was a problem or you could say

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:16,000
you got an error died at line 45

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,799
not particularly useful or if you had

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,799
the line number at all

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,600
uh you could say you got this error

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,399
error getting such and such time out

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,679
okay it's still not really usable this

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,760
is usable

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,720
you got this error here's why you got

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,039
this error

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,279
here's what you do to fix this error

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,320
this requires you to do

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:43,679
more work but it's worth

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,200
doing it's worth doing for the user

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,399
who's using your module for the first

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,240
time

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,159
and suddenly gets this warm fuzzy

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,360
feeling when the error occurs

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,200
it's okay the programmer cared

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,279
the programmer wanted me to know what

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,600
was going on

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,039
it's for you at two o'clock in the

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,440
morning when you're

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,919
tired and muzzy and fuzzy and you can't

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,600
remember exactly how this thing works

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,560
but your error message tells you how you

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,560
have to rescue yourself

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,599
so the goal of psychological engineering

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:18,720
is

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,119
trust me make

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,560
believe in my code believe in what i'm

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,599
doing believe that i am a good

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,399
programmer

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,000
i am communicating to you and giving you

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:31,200
all i can

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,240
about the situation about the error

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,040
about how the code works so that you can

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,440
feel

00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,280
yes this is good code this is code i can

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,839
put in my production code this is code i

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,839
can trust

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,560
now i have gone a little short because i

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,919
wanted to have enough time for people

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,639
to talk about this and and

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:54,000
think about ideas so let's let's take a

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,839
little

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,839
stop here and questions yes

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,240
the success method died if the object

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,839
was in auto check mode

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,480
since it would otherwise only return

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,119
true that's a great a great idea

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,920
if say if the success object caused a

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,520
run time

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,800
or excuse me a compile time error

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,800
instead of a runtime

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,079
right but if we didn't if we didn't get

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,359
to it because autocheck had already

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,280
caused the get

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,480
to fall over we wouldn't have we

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,040
wouldn't have gotten there

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,839
but the idea the idea is sound find as

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,680
many possible ways to inform the user

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,280
say if they ran out with it with uh with

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,119
the the

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,880
i am ignoring the autocheck requirement

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,320
variable on it success should say by the

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,720
way

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,400
i i'm only working because auto check

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,440
has been turned off by

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,440
the global variable

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,000
and sort of saying yes how they could

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
have fixed it like how could these guys

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,280
like going

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,640
like sometimes like when it's happening

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,000
the next release i'm gonna be in this

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,800
awful situation

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,560
what could they have done like before it

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,520
happened in real life oh my god

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,680
that is an excellent question and that

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,000
is one of the hard things about talk

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,400
about software psychology engineering

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,839
you have to start thinking about that

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,480
early on so

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,440
when you say okay when an error occurs

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,920
what am i

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,920
first what was it

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,040
and then why did it happen

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,200
and that's not just the why did the

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,400
error happen

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,599
it's why did i not spot

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:51,040
why it happened you ha and

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,079
this is this is um this requires

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,119
everybody to be

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,240
very egoless about the programming

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,680
you have to say okay it's all right that

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,480
there was a problem

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,079
what we're focused on is fixing the

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,720
problem not saying

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,440
dude you really screwed up here it's

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,520
okay

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,280
we had a problem we need to fix that

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,000
problem what's the right way to fix that

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:23,839
problem

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:23,839
so we don't have it again yes

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,480
exactly so um at white hat in particular

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,599
i have and this is this is this is the

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,320
first place i've worked at

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,359
that that we really do a good job of

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,800
this

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,839
um if something screws up the team

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,079
says we made a mistake

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,079
it's not you know whoever it was who

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,000
wrote that particular section of code

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,240
even if it was you know this one person

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,440
who made a particular mistake it's like

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,680
we screwed this up so how do we keep

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,880
this from happening the next time

00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,520
so there isn't going to be a problem

00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,520
next time yes

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,880
everyone likes to put a release out and

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,599
be like what's all the whole world

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,599
but what do i do

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,320
that is an excellent idea and if you've

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,040
got a if you've got a cross-section of

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,200
folks from

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,640
from very sophisticated to very

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,839
unsophisticated that is the

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,920
very best you can you can do yes

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,680
how do you respond to uh programmers or

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,680
even managers that say

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,280
no don't put a detailed message in there

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,920
we don't want to show that to the

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,920
customers

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,079
it's a good it's a good question um

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,320
it's a good question i think that the

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,079
the right response to that is to say

00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,320
okay that's good we won't show it to the

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,400
customer but we have to log it

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,359
we have to log it in detail so that if

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,520
the pro problem occurs

00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,040
and we know which customer it was which

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,920
transaction it was what time

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,400
it was so that when they call us up and

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,119
say

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,119
we got the the you need to call white

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,400
hat because this is broken error

00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,560
we actually know what one it was i saw

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:29,839
another hand here somewhere

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:29,839
yes no yes

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,240
and that's that's going back to being

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,400
being lazy and

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,839
in the in the parole way which is saying

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,760
yes i know

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,119
that it would be so much easier for me

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,440
to just go ahead and release this

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,640
it was this really cool feature but i'm

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,079
going to be lazy and i'm going to write

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,680
the documentation

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,599
and i'm going to write the deprecation

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,440
cycle stuff and i'm going to write that

00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,760
little bit of code that requires me to

00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,599
keep

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,480
the old way in the new way for this

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:05,280
release and then i can get rid of it

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:11,839
uh it's it's a discipline a personal

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,839
discipline thing yes

00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:21,520
yes yes you you and

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,200
the the way that we found that

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,520
to to work that better is to shorten the

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,680
development cycle say okay

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,359
we're gonna do a little thing we're

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,640
gonna do that little thing right

00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,240
then we're gonna do the next little

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,040
thing and we do that next little thing

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:39,839
right

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:39,839
and building this yes

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,560
um because when you choose a new class

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,880
name it

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,880
well that is a good that's a very good

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,119
question

00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,119
yes

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,040
again that is also an another good idea

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,760
the principal thing that um

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,359
i'm thinking of from another another

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,520
psychological engineering thing is

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,160
minimizing change

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,040
if you can say okay you can take module

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,400
a

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,040
and take module a prime and put it in

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,800
place

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,640
and it works just exactly the same as it

00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,440
did the last time we've added this new

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,079
feature but it won't hurt you

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,079
that's good

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,000
if it's such a big feature that you feel

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,000
like

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,680
okay this is going to endanger all the

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,400
code that i can think of that people

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,319
have done

00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,000
then absolutely the right answer is to

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,720
say look this is

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:53,119
uh www mechanized pro

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,119
to add on this particular new feature

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,200
other questions another discussion

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,839
yes

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,880
you have to then modify your test script

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,839
for basic functionality to work

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,800
then you may want to question that

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,400
change

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,240
that that is that is an excellent

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,440
criterion because your test scripts are

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,560
sort of like those one-offs that

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,480
everybody's going to write and say oh

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,400
god just i just got to get this done

00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,400
you know i'll file it in my in my back

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,760
pocket so if you have to do a huge

00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,520
change like that you can say

00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,680
that's that's giving yourself the cold

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,319
brickleys

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,839
yes so what about a situation where like

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,760
outputting a message that you

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:43,440
think is otherwise helpful could

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,520
otherwise break things like uh

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,119
i'm i was working with like the i o

00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,200
socket ssl stuff

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,440
and it changed one of the parameters for

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,680
a publication and it sprayed out this

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,359
multi-line message that was really large

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,359
but what it actually ended up doing is

00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,880
outputting in like the middle of http

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,480
headers or json

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,079
oh dear things that nobody would ever

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,839
see except for

00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,119
another piece of software that didn't

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,560
understand what to do with it

00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,400
so it ended up breaking like web

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,160
interfaces and just all sorts of things

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,359
where users were just completely closed

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,119
this is what happened

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,119
was not

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,400
was available psychologically engineered

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,240
properly

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,839
i can't off the top of my head come up

00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,800
with a good solution for it i

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:38,319
i but you're absolutely right that's

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,319
exactly the same kind of breakage

00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:44,960
um possibly dumping it's a standard

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,560
error instead it's a standard out

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:51,040
but um or again

00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,960
with a with a deprecation cycle saying

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,400
we're going to change the way we handle

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,319
our error reporting

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,000
for this particular module which is to

00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,240
do this

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,440
in the next release so we've implemented

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,520
that in this release

00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,520
and you can use that by saying new

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,079
messaging equal one when you're creating

00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,920
the object

00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:23,839
uh i think i saw another hand or two

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:23,839
over there yesterday

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,680
absolutely absolutely and the

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,560
um and it also means that the

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,319
uh the devops team and dev have to be

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,560
working very closely together

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,920
in fact there should be a devops team if

00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,000
that makes any sense

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,680
if there isn't one then there should be

00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,040
at least somebody who says okay

00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,880
look we need to get together with the

00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,240
guys who are maintaining the machine

00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,720
and the guys who are running code on the

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,000
machine and make sure that we're

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,119
you know not going to bump heads even if

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,720
it's not a formal

00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,160
there's a group that handles this at

00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,520
least there's some

00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,880
at some point where people talk to each

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,720
other and say oh yeah i'm going to

00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,480
upgrade this module next week and

00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,680
the other person says well is there

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,280
anything that's going to change and i

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,160
say oh yeah this new auto check thing

00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,160
you don't need to worry about that

00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,079
yes seems to me like like this is

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,839
primarily focused for code which is

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,240
intended to be used

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,440
by other programmers things which are

00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,440
designed for end users

00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,960
so it's kind of misunderstood

00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,839
um

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,560
i think i think that it's actually very

00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,400
applicable uh

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,760
from from the same point of view of the

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,800
the way i was coming at it was

00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,480
the the standpoint of okay

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,000
when you're designing your software even

00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,440
if it's software just for you know the

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,640
guy who's on the other end of the web

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,200
browser

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:58,240
when something goes wrong um you need to

00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,839
you know bar borrowing management

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,400
you need to actually tell him what

00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:04,400
happened and what to do

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,920
if there's something that he can do and

00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,960
if there's nothing he can do at least

00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,760
you can tell him

00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,760
this went wrong it's our fault sorry

00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,119
we'll fix it

00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,520
um if it's a situation where

00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,040
there's something that he he or she can

00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,000
actually do

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,359
then it should be okay you know you

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,319
entered you know this particular thing

00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,040
on this forum

00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,800
let's back you up and you can fill in

00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,400
this particular thing that was missing

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,520
and yes by the way we did keep all your

00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,880
other data and you won't have to enter

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,960
it again

00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,000
again that's more psychological

00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,119
engineering saying

00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,280
i'm not going to make you do all this

00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:48,160
work over again and i'm out of time

00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:48,160
