I am Ruth babba set I work for cpanel in

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,429
Houston I just recently joined them that

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:16,260
was in March oh here comes Scott hi

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:22,859
Scott and teammate Scott taking one for

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:27,390
the team and showing up yeah steady

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,580
steady before that I worked in library

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:34,910
automation business I spent 20 years

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:36,719
doing i.t for libraries mostly and

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,309
library automation is an interesting

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,079
business it doesn't matter if you're

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,030
working for a for-profit company your

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,210
customers have no money so you're

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,620
working for a non-profit basically so

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,539
whatever you're doing now for the

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,190
company you're doing with chopped twenty

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,230
thousand dollars off of your salary and

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,210
that's basically what you would be paid

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,820
to do what you're doing right now for

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,260
libraries that was yeah in my case when

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,789
I when I went to cpanel I got a forty

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,470
percent raise plus benefits that I'd

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,680
never had before so that was you know

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,030
really cool yeah so and if that

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,710
interests you you know we've got a booth

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,790
downstairs and we're hiring like damn

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,360
near everything so do please yeah and in

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,119
the end in the in yet thank you Sarah

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,330
I've put in my mandatory plug now I can

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,640
talk about really hard stuff and that's

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,710
people you know this technical stuff

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,350
that we do is not that hard for us that

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,600
do it people think that what we do is

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,280
all amazing and stuff don't they but

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,159
what we do is really simple to us

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,650
because it's what we're good at the hard

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,600
part of any software project has nothing

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,920
whatever to do with technology it is

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,549
those flesh-and-blood people well and

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,770
the people are what makes communities

00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:54,689
the way they are you know all the

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,509
flapper II in the pearl community in the

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,399
last twelve and a half months over goods

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,799
of conduct and all that rot is not

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:07,350
caused by pearl it's caused by Pete pull

00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,390
us us all of us

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,840
who have participated in the Pearl

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:15,300
community now or in the past in the past

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,120
25 years because we have made the

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,950
community what it is today I'm going to

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,209
be talking about the community that I

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,459
know better than I know pearl which is

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,870
the co ha automation community it's an

00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:29,190
open source project for library

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,050
automation mandatory cat picture this is

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,730
my beanbag chair you will be quiet

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,170
normally you will not throw books if you

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,700
prove yourself worthy I will let you pet

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,010
me and I may even come sit on your lap

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:44,160
in the meantime I am watching you

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:47,190
watching closely well I'm going to talk

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,400
about that I'm glad you asked because my

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,290
very next slide is what is co ha well

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,340
coja is an integrated library management

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,019
system manages the collection the

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,269
patrons the relationship between those

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:02,250
things if you borrow a book when it is

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,080
due the rules under which you may borrow

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,790
and for how long you may borrow how much

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,750
you're fine when you don't return it on

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,360
time if at all the libraries purchasing

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,130
budgets and acquisitions how they manage

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,329
their periodical subscriptions to make

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,470
sure that they get all the issues that

00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:19,049
they have paid for and their

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,690
subscriptions all of that stuff is in an

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:23,430
integrated library management system and

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,790
there are two very large open source

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,470
projects that are extant in this country

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,750
right now and one of them is co how the

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,519
other is evergreen which our friend over

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,420
there works for we won't throw rocks at

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,420
the heathens

00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:41,250
cohousing over software it was developed

00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,570
to solve the y2k problem was a rural

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,540
library district in New Zealand the

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,680
horah affinia library trust they still

00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,960
have the same director and she's a

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,410
sweetheart but she realized her software

00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,780
would break and so she contracted a web

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,090
services company to build a new ILS I

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,860
didn't know much about libraries but

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,990
over time as they open source this thing

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,640
more librarians and more techie people

00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,220
who worked with libraries came on board

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,500
and coja has developed and is now fairly

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,380
standards-compliant fairly widely used

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,390
for small to medium sized libraries I

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,000
have dealt with libraries of a million

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:18,000
million and a half volumes 700,000

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,290
patrons and co handles them just fine it

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:28,620
is a fairly fundamental lamp application

00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:30,510
Linux Apache my sequel pearl multiple

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,070
companies around the world are providing

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,050
support hosting and migrations for it

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:38,250
I've worked for three of them here in

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:40,940
the United States let's talk about the

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,440
community from which co-hosts sprung

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,270
because that gives you some insight into

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,900
the problem that koha solves and

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,460
therefore its need for existence

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,280
libraries and librarians generally well

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,390
you need us there's a caveat that

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,730
statistics about diversity gaps in

00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,400
libraries really don't make a lot of

00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:02,070
sense because libraries there's

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,480
stratification in libraries public

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,800
libraries are different from school

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,750
libraries which are different from

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,760
college and university libraries which

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,020
are different from law libraries or

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,760
corporate libraries which we call

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:17,790
special libraries and so librarianship

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,130
in k-12 education in children's

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:23,730
education is much more heavily women

00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:27,720
than in colleges or in public libraries

00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:29,910
or in law libraries it so it varies and

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,280
there's a lot more to it than just how

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,080
many men how many women okay libraries

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,820
are overwhelmingly female professionals

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,110
okay there's another piece a

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,380
professional librarian has a master's

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:46,050
degree in library science period if they

00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,460
don't they're not a librarian

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,009
that term is reserved for somebody who

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,900
has a master's degree and some

00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:55,150
librarians are particularly fussy about

00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,099
that distinction and they will bite your

00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:00,849
nose off and feed it to you for lunch

00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:02,169
over the matter over there laughs people

00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:04,000
who have had their noses fed to them in

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:05,710
such a way by making a mistake of

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,550
calling a paraprofessional librarian and

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:14,139
watching the librarian go which they do

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:20,080
I do that when I do that with librarians

00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:21,610
in the room they go yeah so alright so

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,180
again there's another piece of the

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:28,270
distinction more men or

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:31,419
paraprofessionals percentage wise than

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:33,340
librarians are wibrary ins are women but

00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:36,729
here's the kicker directors offices of

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:40,180
sixty percent male why is that well

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:44,349
let's blame this guy no fair you know

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:46,389
who this is no fair people who work in

00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:51,009
libraries anybody know who this is no

00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:53,229
fair Adam I told you earlier melvil

00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:54,699
Dewey he's the guy who came up with the

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,199
dewey decimal system that is used in

00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:58,270
most public and school libraries here in

00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,979
america melville do it was a professor

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,020
at Columbia College what's now Columbia

00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:04,960
University in eighteen seventy four when

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,250
they decided to start admitting women to

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,349
the library science master's degree

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,870
program and he was a huge supporter of

00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:13,330
this he said this is great we need more

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,800
women librarians at that time public

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,599
libraries were just catching on in this

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,490
country remember the first public

00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:22,599
library in the world was in this country

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:26,229
free public library was Boston hey

00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:28,870
Boston yeah so public libraries were

00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:30,699
still a new thing and we needed lots of

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,039
librarians plus public education was

00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:35,020
catching on and we needed librarians in

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,029
the schools and melvil Dewey said we

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,159
need more librarians we've got to admit

00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:40,870
women I think this is fantastic we need

00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:43,590
more women so that the men can stick to

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:47,229
the important work of leading libraries

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:48,639
double standard you betcha but he's not

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:50,409
totally to blame he wasn't the only

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,639
professor of library science at Columbia

00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:56,710
College at that time structurally the

00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,990
industry like many others was

00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,920
male-dominated

00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:03,150
leadership was in the hands of men how

00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,980
many chiefs the staffs of major

00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:09,660
hospitals or men it's true in a lot of

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,910
industries it's not just libraries okay

00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:17,310
let's talk about cojas development

00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:18,690
process and how they work there are 211

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,640
developers who've had a patch committed

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:23,010
to Co high as of the 17th the nine

00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:27,330
percent of those are women one has a

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:30,830
patch both as a man and a woman that

00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:33,180
would be mean and yeah she's pretty odd

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,950
it's all written in perl except for some

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,120
javascript who used to use Yui we've

00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,180
thrown that overboard we're now

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,200
gradually integrating to bootstrap

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,450
people seem to like it better there's a

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:48,270
lot of jQuery involved but that's mostly

00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:50,760
interface hackery oh there we go edit

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,380
twice six-month release cycle we reelect

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:57,180
the entire release team every six months

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:59,610
which sounds mad and it is but it works

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,520
somebody can be reelected if they want

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:05,870
to and we elect to release maintainer

00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:09,030
for each of the two previous releases

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,290
the one that just came out may 22nd has

00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,210
a release maintainer the one that came

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,260
out six months ago has a maintainer the

00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,670
one that will come out five and a half

00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:19,980
months from now has a new release

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:22,650
manager how do we patch this thing it's

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,540
a global he used application the

00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:27,090
standards for bibliographic data are not

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,640
the same around the world we needed in

00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,350
multiple languages around the world some

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,380
places needed multiple languages in

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:45,300
their own library so there's it's a vast

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:48,240
product no market much now the ISO 80

00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,830
something standard that mark uses for

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,470
its transmission form is standard

00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:56,340
globally however what fields mean what

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:58,500
are not the same globally there are two

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,480
extant standards that are pretty large

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,610
you know mark in most of the world that

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,540
is a única full Unicode compliant and

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:09,870
mark 21 which is the us-canadian kind of

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,670
standard there are some variants Germany

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:16,230
and Norway both have variant mark

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,880
standards as well so yeah it gets

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,760
complex let's talk about the patch

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,760
process how we patch this thing well we

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,320
start with bugzilla we required

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,430
beginning about a year ago that all

00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,540
patches shall have a bugzilla injury

00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,220
well if you like bugzilla that's fine

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,070
doesn't matter doesn't matter which tool

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,870
you use as long as every patch needs to

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,390
be referred to hear somebody writes a

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,300
patch we use get busy because we use get

00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:44,220
for version control and so get bugzilla

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,560
is a really nice tool for handing things

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,030
back and forth between getting bugzilla

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,370
once you've written a patch you say get

00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:53,610
busy commit and it hands it puts it

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,990
attaches it to the bug you have to get

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,310
sign-off from somebody else that

00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,880
somebody else can't work for the same

00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:04,230
company or library that you do most of

00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,030
the time there are rare exceptions the

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,040
QA manager which is an elected position

00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,840
and the QA assistants will then look for

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,610
integration issues they will check for

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,800
adherence to the coding standards more

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,570
about that in a minute and they'll also

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,790
put on balls on and test and see if it

00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:20,250
actually works and they will flunk

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:23,670
patches you know for no testing plan

00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,140
they will flunk patches for you didn't

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,990
comment this and you probably should

00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:31,250
they will flunk patches for why did you

00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,510
indent with three spaces you knucklehead

00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:37,410
then the release manager or the release

00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:39,660
maintainer will integrate and push if

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,820
that sounds draconian there's a reason

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:46,020
for that we've had loose cannons who had

00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:48,060
commitments before it's bad yeah so so

00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,470
this is you know it seems a little

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,740
bourke onian to some people in the

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:55,050
community and there are bottlenecks the

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,320
QAM is a big bottleneck yes yes yes it

00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,880
happens and if she's watching the live

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,280
stream which I think she probably is

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,680
she's probably logging onto IRC right

00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,150
now and writing vile things about me for

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,230
saying evil things about I'm not country

00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:13,050
and really I'm not okay the nature of

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,810
the development patch of our development

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,400
process is that like a lot of open

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,170
source project for relatively few people

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,269
are actually paid to do this there

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,980
you know half a dozen big companies

00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:25,779
around the world that are doing this

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,160
kind of thing and they all pay one or

00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:30,100
two or three or four developers to do

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,579
this and a huge percentage of the

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,410
patches come from those sources and

00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:36,880
there's this great long tail of people

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:41,620
who have put in one or two or three or

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:44,860
ten patches and the non-paid developers

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,870
are often library users not regular Perl

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,269
developers who are trying to solve a

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:53,860
problem that frustrates them in their

00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:56,639
day-to-day workings this bugs me so I'm

00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:00,459
going to fix it and if they're not

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,079
competent to do that well some of them

00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:03,820
fix it anyway whether they're competent

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,820
to or not and some of them will sponsor

00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,649
the development pay somebody who is but

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,690
either way that patch is originating

00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:13,120
from somebody who's not routinely

00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,980
considered a developer and that's led to

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,930
some decisions in the coop community the

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,089
community has decided that that long

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,490
tail is worth having that's one of the

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:23,380
beauties of open-source play Shirky did

00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,600
a presentation at can a few years ago

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,730
about the long tail of open source

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,980
projects and how valuable that is and

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:33,190
the community's really decided that's

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,079
worth having and the coding practices

00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:38,079
and standards therefore have to reflect

00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:40,660
that we need lower barriers to entry we

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,990
don't need every developer to be as

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,810
sharp as Matt trout or as obscene as

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:49,269
neck wrap or but never end can you

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,850
imagine 50 developers all bellowing at

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:54,190
each other in Madison ever mine that's a

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,970
scary thought isn't it so here's a

00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:57,399
little bit of our coding guidelines

00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:00,550
please hardcore developers try not to

00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:02,500
throw up on the floor our emphasis on

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,699
readability a whole lot of our

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,949
guidelines have to do with spicy

00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:08,440
variable names make sure you use modern

00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:11,199
colon colon pearl thank you yay modern

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,810
pearl you look at coding standard the w1

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,449
has access to yes it's on a wiki it's on

00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:19,990
the wiki and i'll give you a link into

00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:25,420
the community here a little bit we don't

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:27,100
use objects heresy it's not object

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,269
oriented no it's very procedural the

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,459
only thing we have that kind of look

00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:32,970
like objects which are

00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:37,889
ashes are real world things books

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:42,300
branches people users because librarians

00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:46,199
if you talk about a class if you talk

00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:48,089
about a class constructor a class

00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:51,059
constructor for a book I'm sorry is a

00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:52,079
publishing house they're used to that if

00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:53,519
you talk about that as a piece of

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,970
software they're going to give you the

00:14:53,519 --> 00:15:00,360
blank thousand-yard stare and rightly so

00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,860
that's not their job koha is coated

00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,540
around that concept that even a

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,790
librarian who is not a coder can stick

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:10,829
their fingers in the code and make some

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:12,509
sense out of it so there's very slow

00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:14,249
movement toward object oriented and yes

00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:18,420
it's moose there's a little bit of

00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:19,860
moosie stuff happening now sort of but

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,339
it's really low level stuff here's some

00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:26,730
more Horrors for you tests just became

00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:30,540
mandatory last year and now only in the

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,670
core main sizes and the rest of our

00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,589
testing was done by you know spin it up

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,170
and try and see if it does what you can

00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:38,519
get that which yes is a very tedious way

00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,610
to do testing and it doesn't work very

00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:44,429
well in the long run especially on a

00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,980
multi lingual multi platform multiple

00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:51,299
coding standards system it really gets

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:53,129
complex most idioms in Perl that our

00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:55,889
kind of common place among hardcore

00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:59,639
developers just don't happen in Perl the

00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:01,499
ternary operator maybe a half a dozen

00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:07,290
lot of times in thirty thousand lines of

00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:09,779
code maybe a half dozen times postfix if

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:12,899
and unless now and they just don't do

00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:16,829
that now having read pro best practices

00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:18,600
I don't care for post fix if and unless

00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:21,269
myself and I don't care for unless at

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,339
all but that's just a readability thing

00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:25,110
that's a preference thing but those

00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,389
idioms just don't happen in our code

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,790
very much because it is a barrier to

00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:34,610
entry for a new developer to see those

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:36,799
videos now you might be tempted and

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,419
Matt's not here so I talked about in

00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,750
people who are go-getters energetic who

00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,120
never

00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:44,070
sleep might be tempted to go in and say

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,020
God I can make that so much more

00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:49,130
efficiently I mean look code yet and I

00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:52,230
could make that so much better don't

00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:56,220
okay the Pearl community neither wants

00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:58,170
nor needs people who can fix it by

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,650
someone who knows better even if you do

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:04,860
and I met some of you probably do that's

00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:06,300
fine there was a guy who came in a while

00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,900
back and he really really really urged

00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:15,630
people we need database independence we

00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:17,069
need divx class he was shunned because

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,000
the first thing he brought was you need

00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:22,470
to change everything you've been doing

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,050
for a decade not a patch you want to

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:28,620
talk change bring a patch patches change

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,880
stuff not talk and that's how the

00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,580
community is there and they're very very

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,710
slope to to adopt Rodger gran things for

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,180
the same reason because it's changed and

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,470
change happened slowly and you haven't

00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:42,840
had anybody who's really champion to

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:44,310
that in a positive way ok rewriting well

00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,050
yes Cahan does need a complete rewrite

00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:49,740
there are bits of it that are just

00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:51,120
insane madness it's not it's not mark

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,300
independent I would like to see it able

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,760
to accept XML data or mods or myths or

00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,470
some of the other formats but no the

00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,970
idea of using catalyst and rewriting all

00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,830
that or using dancer and rewriting all

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,860
that has been floated no it's no

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,840
traction whatsoever Sisyphus rolling

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,100
uphill you can do that but you will get

00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,580
rolled over and then you'll be back

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:14,730
bottom the hill again try again is koha

00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,990
a duoc receipt or a meritocracy now if

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,030
Sharon talked about this last year in

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,590
his keynote about meritocracy and there

00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:24,540
really aren't any there aristocracies

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:27,710
Amen kohai is an aristocracy absolutely

00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:31,620
it's not even close to a democracy

00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:34,230
however that said if you want to get

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:37,170
into the Aqua sea and the leadership you

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:40,020
better do something doing nothing is

00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:42,630
worth that much it's worth what you put

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,830
in it and if all you put in is takats

00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,870
all you're going to get our semi

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,310
benevolent dictator is Chris Cormac the

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,980
original author of Quahog he's from New

00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,429
Zealand he's about this tall and half

00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,240
Maori

00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:58,590
and can be quite intimidating when earth

00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:03,299
and he remembers very well the things

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:05,820
that irk him and he forgives but he

00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:09,720
doesn't forget and if you mess with his

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:12,269
trust it takes a long long time to get

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,649
it back okay there's a lot of people

00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:17,220
like that I'm not saying that's a bad

00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:22,980
thing but even when he's not the release

00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:24,690
manager he has a lot of pull okay so if

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,340
you want to get involved in coming in

00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,230
and chattering on the channel on the car

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,669
see is no good whatsoever don't start

00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,169
with that other than asking questions

00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,490
and trying to hey I really want to get

00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:35,039
involved i think this is really cool and

00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,240
how can i help another that's great if

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,679
you come in and say all we need to fix

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,549
class we need this would need that now

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,169
no good you get a few patches in hey

00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:45,090
there's a huge bugzilla database plenty

00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:47,789
of patches you can make learning that

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:50,340
way whatever works get on Chris's good

00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:51,360
side be submitting some good stuff that

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,399
gets him interested in what you're

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,799
talking about then you can get somewhere

00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:57,629
I was scared you yet the community has a

00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:00,269
process for discussion of big stuff they

00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:03,299
have monthly IRC meetings anybody's

00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:06,600
welcome show up anybody may vote even on

00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:10,049
big things but the process is somewhat

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:13,259
glacial get used to it have i have i

00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:16,169
frightened you yet cohosh community not

00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:21,019
org is the community's home there is a

00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:24,929
coho org that has been usurped by fork

00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:27,419
we don't like them very much call to

00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:29,279
action which seems kind of strange

00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:32,999
because I've been telling you don't no

00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,499
no no no right so it's kind of a cult in

00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:37,799
action and I'll finish quickly and we're

00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:40,169
done know that in here we step away from

00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,240
just koha or just pearl or just whatever

00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:47,879
community here in know the communities

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:50,070
you are in it's more than just code it

00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:52,169
is human beings even the ones you

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,940
haven't met because they live on the far

00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:55,799
side of the planet my best friend on the

00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,769
planet is somebody I've never met

00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:59,759
face-to-face but i'm going to this

00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:02,410
October because she's come to a

00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:08,080
conference all right she's in Germany

00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:09,880
and yeah I hope she's watching but no

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,380
the communities know the people get to

00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,120
know them talk to them ask them

00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,070
questions ask them what drives them why

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,050
they do this why are they involved in

00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,370
koha because I'm helping my library

00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,910
because I'm helping the library that

00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:25,870
honest to god my mom works at in one

00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:28,630
case know the community all of them are

00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,510
a little different what works in one may

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:34,270
or may not work in another and that's

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:35,770
okay we were told last year that the

00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,290
apache software foundation was a really

00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:39,370
good way to run a software community is

00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,560
a really good way to run the pearl

00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:45,670
community I don't know I'm not qualified

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,740
to make that call none of us is none of

00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,720
us is know that the communities the

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,400
products of history that you may or may

00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,720
not know ask the people that are

00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:58,630
knowledgeable why is this so and know

00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,070
that there is no wrong way there are

00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,380
some ways that you may see is less

00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:05,110
productive some ways that that have any

00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:11,410
sense but it goes back to that history

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:13,870
thing you weren't there 10 years from

00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:16,960
now we'll be saying oh you weren't at

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:19,030
gap CNA 2012 when all this hullabaloo

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,320
went down you and i'll be talking about

00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,330
it over beer though i know you know

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:28,170
these youngsters they don't know what we

00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:30,340
went through write this stuff passes

00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:34,360
observe learn and ask questions that's

00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:36,850
the call to action not code do that

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,490
later because the people are far more

00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:45,040
interesting in the first place the code

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:47,080
is cool the people are amazing i hope

00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,130
this has helped you i hope you can find

00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,270
something in there that you can take

00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:51,790
back to the communities that you're a

00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:54,760
part of whether they are corporate your

00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:57,160
churches your civic organizations your

00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:02,310
software communities because this

00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,310
