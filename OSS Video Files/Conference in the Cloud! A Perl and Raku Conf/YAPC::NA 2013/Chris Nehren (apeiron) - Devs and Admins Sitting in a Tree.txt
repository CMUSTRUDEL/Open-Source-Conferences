afternoon whether it's good or not

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,280
probably depends upon how long you

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:11,730
stayed inside so I'm Chris there an

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,670
apparent on IRC and I work for a firm

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:22,439
called a meaty I I'm a system in for

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:24,840
them so probably the first thing that we

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,050
should cover is how many people in the

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,439
room are rather identify as developers

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:38,570
primarily looks just about what I would

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:41,300
expect assistant administrators DevOps

00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:46,440
something that I didn't mention already

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:51,230
know okay okay oh well yes of course a

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:54,780
little bit both so this talk is going to

00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:59,430
be focusing on from the developer side

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:03,420
of how to make your developer of your

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:06,540
admins lives easier because when you're

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,880
arguing with people when you're getting

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,290
into fights and not moving things

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,119
forward you're not getting worked on and

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:18,509
as professionals where our job is to do

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,070
stuff so you know we want to be able to

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,290
get along with one another and as a

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,479
system administrator for going on almost

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,939
a year now full-time there are many

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,159
things that I've learned that developers

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,360
had to do that I used to do myself so

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,950
I'm putting myself on in you know

00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,290
blaming myself for this as well so some

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,140
things that we could do to make lives

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,079
easier slides or will be on bitbucket

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,320
once I make the repo public all the

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,259
content is creative commons share alike

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,119
so if you would whoever you want with it

00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:56,930
so summery work at omni TI and some of

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,729
you might know them as specializing in

00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:01,979
highly scalable operations the things

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,640
like 10,000 requests per second is you

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:09,259
know commonplace for some of our clients

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:12,680
so that kind of thing e

00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:15,110
is a lot more complex and there are many

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,129
different ways in which things can fail

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:23,510
more creatively shall we say then a

00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:26,750
smaller scale kind of site so there are

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:31,700
it's more critical to be able to move

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:33,769
quickly and do things correctly so that

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,150
things don't fall over sooner when you

00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,689
have you know when you're trying to

00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:43,099
scale up to high load and so that is

00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:44,840
this is actually part 1 of one-half of a

00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:47,239
series of thoughts that I want to give

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,239
the other one being on admin topping

00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,159
devs so I'm not just trying to single

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,670
out the days I'm going to be telling my

00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:59,150
pad min kulli excited be better too so

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,250
right now another thing that is part of

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,920
this is that I think full stack

00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,810
generalists are the key to moving

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,870
forward for scalable operations and what

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:12,200
I mean by a full stack generalist is

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:14,660
someone who can go up and down the full

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,299
software stack to do to be able to solve

00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,400
any kind of problem that you could have

00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:21,829
and I can think of three examples I'll

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,510
stop my head within the last few months

00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:29,840
where the problem was at a kernel driver

00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:32,720
level impacting production and we have

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,299
graphs that actually show this data very

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,500
very visually so we have evidence that

00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,049
you know it is actually the kernel

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,019
driver we're not just making stuff up so

00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:43,579
being able to go up and down from the

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,989
from your app that you're actually

00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:47,599
interacting your users are interacting

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:49,489
with to all the way down to something

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,199
you would pass off your system and if

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:56,750
you don't have the competence to really

00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:59,299
do all of that then you're going to get

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,650
roblox and you're going to not be able

00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,669
to solve your problems as quickly now

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,889
I'm not saying you need to know

00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:05,269
everything because of course as things

00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:09,229
get more complex it's harder to know

00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:13,129
everything but there there is a drive

00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:15,919
towards being more competent and being

00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:18,349
more knowledgeable at least if not able

00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,670
to debug a kernel driver issue because I

00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:23,230
can't do that right now although I know

00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:28,600
to go to begin doing that kind of thing

00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:31,450
so it's more a perspective of what needs

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,260
to be done and thinking about the

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:37,180
problems opening your mind to different

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,250
ways of looking at problems if it's not

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,840
just a bug in your app if you're doing

00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,630
really highly scalable things you might

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,730
be limited be hitting the upper limit on

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,220
the TCP states in your open vs CPF

00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,840
firewall you might be exposing a bug in

00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,690
the text something for your Intel eat

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,600
1,000 genic just doing the apples off my

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:58,060
head so also one other thing that is

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,940
pretty critical as we're going to be

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:04,300
doing highly scalable apps is to make

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:08,170
sure that the business metrics are also

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,690
very visible to the people who care

00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,920
about those because generally they're

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,770
going to be the ones who give you a

00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,190
budget ie a paycheck so you might want

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,810
to make those people happy right so you

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,910
might have gotten something of an

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,760
indication that I'll be talking about

00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:27,940
DevOps today and while I did not

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:31,300
envision this talk originally as being a

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,850
DevOps talk you could kind of call it

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,750
that in that DevOps is a cultural

00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:40,360
movement which is centered on bringing

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:43,570
developers and operations together so

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,390
you could call this a DevOps talk in

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:49,420
that sense but you don't really have to

00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:54,160
do DevOps as a thing whatever that thing

00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:56,340
maybe to put into practice some of the

00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,150
things that I'll be suggesting today

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:03,660
right so and of course you know quick

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,660
somebody yes

00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:18,640
very well yeah one sec is this any

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:22,930
better now I'll just speak up I'm sorry

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:24,790
okay so right just you know summary what

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,350
we're going to be covering today some

00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,160
social skills to make everyone's lives

00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:33,730
easier this is some sorts of things that

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,800
in the very rushed nature of development

00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,510
that tend to be skipped but that I as a

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,660
system administrator at 3am in the

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:43,480
morning I'm frustrated about let's say

00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,670
when it's when they don't happen so

00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,410
these are some things i would appreciate

00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:49,000
as an administrator just having around

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,010
their very simple sorts of things

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,290
they're not very complicated and there

00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,900
are some technical things that we can go

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,670
over as well now i'm going to be

00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,950
mentioning a few specific pathologies

00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:03,880
these are not endorsements these are

00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:06,520
just examples of what works for us how

00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,160
we do things what works for what I've

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,280
been doing and some of them are singular

00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,710
implementations in that there aren't any

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,700
real other alternatives so if we're

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,290
going to be doing something I'm

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:21,220
suggesting you will be using this tool

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:23,800
likely but as is the nature of open

00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:27,040
source that will be changing as things

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,040
move on so feel free to disregard the

00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:35,530
specifics and you know the concepts of

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:37,090
what tools do is important so what do

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,580
tech people do I guess we should start

00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,910
there do you identify how we can do

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:46,840
things better we are builders we are

00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:49,330
enablers we're translators of technology

00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:53,310
into things that people can use and

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:56,680
we're interfaces and we have eyes burn

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:59,020
okay all right so what I mean by all

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,820
this is where builders we make things

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,680
right we put things together we make

00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:07,480
things we assemble stuff from parts and

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:10,780
beyond this we are enablers what I mean

00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,610
by enablers is that a someone who

00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,860
doesn't have computer skills will come

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,320
to us whether that's a client or a

00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,510
customer or

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,290
someone in your organization and will

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:25,500
say I want to do X for whatever value of

00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:28,470
x and so they don't have the computer

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,690
skills to really be able to do X on

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,539
their own okay that's fine we're

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:36,650
technical people and it's our job to do

00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,940
X for them or to enable them to do X and

00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:43,500
we're also translators and what I mean

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:46,230
by translators is that we take their non

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,300
technical requirements and you know

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,920
translate that into tech which is you

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,230
know very basic overview of the

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,950
development process but also interfaces

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,360
and what I mean by interfaces is that

00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,280
with all of our systems that we're

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,790
putting together and building so on so

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,440
forth the business people if they don't

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,020
know the unix shell or whatever they're

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,200
going to need some kind of help to get

00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,660
some insight into the nature of their

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,400
systems and how they're working so we

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,830
don't have to sit and answer all their

00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,200
questions all day we have tools to make

00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:22,010
that easier but we need to build those

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:27,540
tools and as such we are the interface

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:29,760
so and let's start with the social

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,690
skills sure if you can see that but

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,830
there's supposed to be a cat there so

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,950
you have to have a cat on the slide

00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:41,430
about memes you just have to so add a

00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:45,660
stapler need a red stapler so right now

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:48,990
of course as there's 40 50 people in

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,880
this room reasonably full it is evident

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:54,120
from at least this perspective that

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,420
humans are very social creatures and so

00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:01,610
you know it is very it is a very common

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:05,430
cliche but the ability to communicate is

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,810
very very very critical and there are a

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,240
number of different communication

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,370
methods that you can do in a technical

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,440
environment and i'll be going over a few

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:17,130
of them that make my life much easier

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,650
and if my life is easier I'm happy and

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:22,170
you want me to be happy right so good

00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:24,720
okay so one thing that I do want to

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:27,870
point out is a rather favorite quote of

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,440
mine from gaming conway this is an

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,680
excerpt of a quote

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,410
it is documentation is a love letter and

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,410
what I mean by that is that it's

00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,150
something that you put together that is

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,730
going to be consumed at a later date

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:47,140
which yes it's generally how it works

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:50,080
and it's not only that you're putting it

00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,600
together to make your life easier but

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,570
you're putting it together to facilitate

00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,010
everyone else doing their job and

00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,930
keeping people happy making sure they

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,280
can do what they want to do enabling

00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,740
them to succeed that sounds like love to

00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:05,770
me so documentation is a love letter and

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,600
it's not just what you write in the wiki

00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:10,060
or in your markdown docs or in your

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,360
source code it's all application output

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:17,050
is documentation and this if you're

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,060
thinking about log output or stuff your

00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,290
app your app puts two standard outs here

00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,460
and there or whatever that's

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:25,270
documentation that happens at runtime

00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,880
and of course you know don't forget

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:32,070
simple emails phone calls into the

00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:36,160
traditional things that kind of thing so

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,600
now it might be a little confusing you

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,700
know what you want to communicate sort

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,850
of everything because saying everything

00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,380
does not really help very much so one of

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,030
the things that is you know pretty

00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,490
critical from my point of view is I

00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:51,250
would like to see operations departments

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,900
involved from the beginning from the

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,290
beginning of an application lifecycle

00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,300
that means requirements design

00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:00,760
implementation maintenance all planning

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:04,030
needs to involve ops ops meaning

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,650
operations or edmonds and obviously

00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,820
operations people need to know about

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,060
operational changes I mean not

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,440
necessarily every code change you don't

00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,450
really need to know those kinds of

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,460
things because you're not a developer

00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:18,280
but you need to know we need to know

00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,560
what is going on high level at least for

00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,010
your application so that we know what to

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,839
expect when we get high load at peak

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:29,110
time whatever p time is for your app or

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,870
some other vagary of how it performs we

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:35,470
need to understand how it's changed to

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:38,080
be able to expect or be surprised at

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,420
some kind of behavior so being able to

00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,000
let us know when you're changing things

00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,470
it sounds simple but at least one

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,340
client of ours doesn't do this they must

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:50,080
be very very very frustrated so right so

00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,370
of course some people might been

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,190
wondering you know why involve

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,420
operations from the beginning if

00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:58,440
operations is just going to deploy the

00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,910
application and make sure it runs so

00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,000
generally in most firms and I know of

00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:06,940
the operations team is responsible for

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,950
the capacity planning for the hardware

00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,930
that's going to be deployed on so the

00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:14,140
operations department will get a budget

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:16,150
to spend on hardware for deploying your

00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,100
application so if you know that your

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:22,330
application is going to need 16 gigs of

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:24,850
RAM or 100 or 200 or whatever or some

00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:27,220
other hardware requirements then it's

00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,620
important to get that out as soon as you

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,650
can so that the budgets can be made and

00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,660
so that there's no surprises to the CFO

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,160
if they're surprises to the cfl you

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,450
don't get a bonus so you want a bonus

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,790
right so get that information in soon

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:45,850
right and also beyond that once you've

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:47,560
actually got the hardware provisions the

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,140
operations team is generally responsible

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,540
for doing maintenance planning what i

00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:54,780
mean by maintenance planning is things

00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,520
like operating the application or

00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,550
provisioning larger disks or that kind

00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,620
of thing so if we know the usage profile

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,980
of your app in terms of his resources

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,240
then we can better anticipate when

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,920
you're when we're going to run out of

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,010
disk when we're going to need more

00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:14,290
memory what kind of cpu we can expect

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:17,320
this thing to use and so on and of

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:20,260
course the very traditional sort of view

00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,000
of system administration is that the

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,890
operations people will be responsible

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,420
for keeping the app running the very

00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,040
traditional stereotypical view is a

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,850
system beginning in the call at 3am in

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:34,960
the morning so this is of course what we

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:38,950
usually are known for doing and it's it

00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,540
doesn't it goes without saying that we

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,040
should know we should be able to

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,320
understand how things are going to

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:48,520
behave so we can actually do this

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,030
intelligently and of course also

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,950
obviously the operations team knows the

00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,780
production environment how many devs

00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,320
here don't really have access to their

00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:04,480
production of

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:06,850
it's not as few hands as i disagree with

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,450
you it was not as many hands as i was

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:13,270
expecting which is if it's done well can

00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:16,060
be a good thing so in a traditional

00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:18,510
environment it is in the operations

00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,130
people who have access to production and

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,240
will be pushing things there so if

00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,300
you're a developer and you don't know

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,920
production then we'll it's it should be

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,230
very obvious that you need to

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,850
communicate what production needs to be

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,040
so the admins can make sure that it fits

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,830
your expectations seems pretty obvious

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,880
but there is matching anyway so

00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:43,990
lifecycle what i mean by lifecycle is

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:48,010
the upgrading and maintenance of the

00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:50,440
application in and in addition to the

00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:54,970
development lifecycle so it's it's you

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:58,200
know full project really so also of

00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,860
course it's all about communication and

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,260
hopefully you know things will be

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,460
clearer about why it's important so of

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,960
course you know if you let the

00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,170
operations team know what's going on

00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,640
then their confusion with things

00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,730
changing will be reduced which means

00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:15,460
they'll be happier communication enables

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,530
better responses to situations so if

00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:21,220
something changes and it causes downtime

00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:23,110
of some sorts then if we know that

00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,780
something is going to happen or we know

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,610
the situation then we can react more

00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,850
intelligently more rapidly which made

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:33,040
more money which means a bonus right so

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,840
also communication as I mentioned a

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,110
little earlier helps with projecting

00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:41,140
performance and costs so if you have an

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:43,900
assets using a gigabyte per month for

00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:46,030
data of whatever sort say a database is

00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,750
growing that fast you know you can be

00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:52,660
able to you are able to determine if you

00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:54,610
let it go without doing anything you

00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,420
will need to buy a new disk or ship data

00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:03,250
off at this time which is good for not

00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:05,140
only the CFO but also your whoever's in

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,570
charge of your products so you know when

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,720
to schedule downtime or maintenance of

00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:11,030
that sort

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,610
and of course when you're not

00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,380
communicating generally people tend to

00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,730
have a lower morale because they feel

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,919
left in the dark they feel like they

00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,470
don't have a sense of agency they feel

00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,459
like they don't have any input into

00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,539
what's going on so if you're

00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:28,039
communicating then people will feel

00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:29,480
involved and if they feel involved

00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:31,880
generally they'll feel a lot better is

00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,350
there anyone here who doesn't feel

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,140
better when they're involved in

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:39,860
something that they're responsible for

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:46,490
really that's not what we're talking

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:48,860
about but you say okay so so of course

00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,650
you know what is it that ops actually

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,360
does the very traditional sense well we

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,880
keep the app running but what does that

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,890
really mean what do I do when I keep the

00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,780
giro running where the app server

00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:02,150
running or the load balancer you know

00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,640
it's it's deploying it which is you know

00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:07,520
installing the app and and especially in

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,370
a pearl world all this dependencies all

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,190
its dependencies oh the dependencies as

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,700
we move towards more dynamic languages

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:18,320
like Perl Python Ruby javascript etc

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,360
with a lot of reusable libraries the

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,299
dependencies is especially something

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,669
that needs to be communicated early as

00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:27,200
early as possible and as updates commend

00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:29,659
we need to know you know what's going on

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,640
so that we don't have we don't upgrade

00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:34,640
your JSON diversion to and brickell your

00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,650
code or we don't upgrade your www

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,580
mechanize and break all your code if you

00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:43,280
were here earlier today so and beyond

00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:46,210
just making sure the app can run this

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:50,059
involves actually starting the app gas

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:51,320
which can happen in any number of ways I

00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:52,909
mean this is pearl so there's you know

00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,070
six dozen different ways to do it but

00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:58,340
beyond even the Pearl methods there are

00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:01,220
things at the operating system level

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,870
like upstart and there are other things

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,070
like daemon tools in SMF and so on

00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,770
someone so we're going to go on and on

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:09,950
about all that so having something

00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,740
standardized across all of your

00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:14,890
applications makes it simpler and

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:17,090
simpler is easier to understand and

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:20,269
leads to better maintance law remains

00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:23,149
costs which again notice so

00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:25,849
or you know whatever other motivator you

00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:29,749
have so and of course there's monitoring

00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:31,849
and maintenance which is things that are

00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:34,580
typically what you would have your admin

00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:39,409
doing but I really do seriously believe

00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:42,369
that a dev will doe at least some

00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:46,669
metrics about an application performance

00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:48,409
that will be useful to monitor say this

00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:49,779
application suppose beginning 10,000

00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:52,279
requests per second if it's not

00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:54,950
something might be wrong either the

00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,929
network is down going to it or it's not

00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:00,109
as busy as it should be for some reason

00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:03,079
and that's separate from the simple is

00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:04,909
it up metric I work for a firm that

00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:06,649
doesn't monitor as a monitoring system

00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:07,669
and they have shirts that say just

00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:14,149
because it's up doesn't mean it's

00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:17,959
working so and beyond even beyond even

00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:20,119
the is it up is it working even more

00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:22,429
importantly than that is is it making

00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:24,499
money if you're in a situation where

00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,839
you're making money or whatever other

00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:30,169
business metrics you have it need them

00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:32,929
up the monitoring needs to take care of

00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:34,879
those so if you are aware of you know

00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:36,589
business metrics which you should be as

00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:38,269
you're delivering a product to a

00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:40,429
customer it's important to make sure

00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:42,579
that those are communicated to the admin

00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:44,809
team so they can get those up and

00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:46,309
maintenance this is you know upgrading

00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:48,320
which is what I talked about a little

00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:49,820
bit before making sure you don't upgrade

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,129
your JSON break your code or whatever

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:55,129
something like that that kind of thing

00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:59,659
and also making sure the app is up and

00:20:55,129 --> 00:21:01,729
running and doing hardware upgrades you

00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:03,619
know that kind of thing it's sort of

00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:07,190
obvious but you know it's the

00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:09,079
traditional thing so and of course you

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:12,529
know if you're going to be writing

00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:14,359
documentation about all of this maybe

00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:18,709
your employer isn't going to need you

00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:22,219
once you write it right no no no no no

00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:24,440
no no no no lots of managers love people

00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:26,570
who do ducks lots of managers love

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,919
people who do ducks my manager tells me

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,859
he's very happy whenever I do

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,079
documentation just you know has anyone

00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:33,570
ever actually been admonished for

00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:36,840
writing

00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:39,890
mutation no I didn't think so so there

00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:44,520
you go you have evidence empirical I

00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:46,380
love you okay so no one's actually been

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,120
modest for writing docs so obviously

00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,460
it's a good thing that there needs to be

00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:54,420
more of you know as said before good

00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:57,870
documentation is a love letter to people

00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:00,960
who read it so the reaction isn't to

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,580
replace but as was just said rather to

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,500
reward people who write documentation

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,400
because they in people who write

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,330
documentation are enabler they

00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,420
accelerate the team they make things

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:14,310
better for everyone around them so me

00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,260
more documentation and I have some

00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,390
thoughts on doing documentation that

00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,500
I've learned from open source projects

00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:22,650
and I can tell you more about those

00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,940
after talk and of course good ducks if I

00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,280
don't need to page you at three in the

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,470
morning which I will which I have it

00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,720
makes me love you so it's all about the

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:33,300
love right so of course you know what to

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,370
document there's the you know very very

00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:38,010
simple stuff I mentioned the simple

00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:40,890
stuff because I've been in situations

00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:43,290
where it's been entirely absent so I'm

00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,810
going to just give benefit of the doubt

00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,280
and say maybe people don't know to

00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:49,350
document this maybe they think it's

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,600
obvious because obvious to them or

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:53,220
whatever so you know basic stuff like

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,230
how do i install this how do i deploy

00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,660
this if the admin is not going to be

00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,340
responsible for doing this a lot of

00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,720
deaths here raise their hands for access

00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,100
to production okay so if we're going to

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,560
be doing if you're going to have access

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:07,560
production presumably you have that to

00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:10,140
install your app fine okay that's cool I

00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,850
just want to make sure that I know if I

00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,090
need to roll out a new app or roll out a

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:17,610
new server or the disc failed 92 deploy

00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,950
the app somehow I need to know how to

00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:23,460
actually do that which could be get

00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:25,890
checkouts or CPM or packages you know so

00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,870
on so forth how to start and stop it

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:30,060
which could be you know any of the other

00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:33,630
methods I described before most

00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:38,040
importantly so far where it puts its

00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:39,920
logs it is logging right somehow somehow

00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:44,760
stems will grow

00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:46,590
yes getting to that so yes as was

00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:51,050
mentioned the logs will grow so

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:55,200
calculate into your resource planning

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:58,410
the overhead your logs will have on disk

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,559
in terms of retention and rotation

00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:04,140
because very few things are more

00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,630
annoying and getting paged at three in

00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,910
the morning about a full disc for lobs I

00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:13,050
getting spammed the on-call address is

00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:13,980
worse but normally a little so what is

00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,059
this isn't it you don't know if you

00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,559
delete that log you know it was valuable

00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:19,350
as anyone or not that's the worst thing

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:28,350
ever if if it was properly documented I

00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:31,080
would know so also in addition to logs I

00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:33,690
would like to know what kind of problems

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,600
this application has you know does it

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,429
sometimes get bad data that hasn't you

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,710
haven't had a chance to fix yet maybe

00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:43,140
you get bad email addresses or something

00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,690
cuz emails to living maybe you get

00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,220
garbage from a vendor or rather maybe

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,600
give our garbage from a vendor service

00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,010
you're using maybe they didn't implement

00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,450
all their API and they say they didn't

00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,820
they lied to you because vendors are

00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,650
evil you know that kind of thing and it

00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:59,610
helps to have standard operating

00:24:55,650 --> 00:25:02,910
procedures ie a checklist of things that

00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:04,980
you can go through for solving problems

00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:07,260
and standard operating procedures or

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:10,470
stops are something that ami TI is

00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:12,390
rolling out recently stolen from Ben

00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:15,210
rockwood and i would love to talk more

00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:18,660
about this after the talk but there's so

00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:20,970
much more stuff right install the poi

00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:24,270
docks you know basic sort of stuff you

00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:27,290
got a few years ago at UFC think maybe

00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:31,380
it was asheville talked about how to

00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:33,929
deploy a plaque app and i think he spent

00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:37,370
about an hour not giving a specific

00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:40,620
suggestion he was very polite and

00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:43,559
equivocal in terms of covering all the

00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:46,620
options but from a system in perspective

00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:49,560
i want something definitive it needs

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:51,750
engine X version 1.2 eight pacifically

00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,940
1.28 not the 1.43 that was just released

00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:56,340
you need to insult with you p.m.

00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,690
using this mirror so on so forth and as

00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,629
I said earlier your unit dependencies

00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,789
are a big deal has anyone ever actually

00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:07,139
written a script in production that does

00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:09,929
not use a module I don't think so so

00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:12,840
there you go dependencies are the nature

00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:15,720
of pearl and it's not even just the

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:19,200
modules but it's the database the

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,659
firewall the disk the network and so on

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,889
so forth everything that your app needs

00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:27,299
from operating system to the code itself

00:26:24,889 --> 00:26:30,509
we need to know that so we can get

00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:33,600
things out and moving and there are some

00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:36,179
environment particulars say I'm not sure

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,940
how many people here are environment

00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:42,389
where admins are doing some stuff in

00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:45,299
either dev or staging environment but at

00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:46,679
least one of our clients I will

00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:50,519
sometimes need to go into a dev

00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:52,529
environment to fix things or to deploy

00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:53,639
something so knowing any of the

00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:55,019
particulars about that kind of

00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:57,899
environment I mean it's something as a

00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:59,970
developer possibly by definition you

00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:02,639
work with every day so you're familiar

00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:06,090
with it ok great I would hope you would

00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:08,820
be but an admin use juggling prod and

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:13,080
Dev and staging and provisioning someone

00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:15,389
may not have that expertise so being

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,850
able to know what kind of particulars

00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:20,549
there are for an environment like say

00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:23,630
let's not dropped the prod database from

00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:26,600
a test framework height github

00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:29,330
and of course as with pretty much

00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,210
everything having config management

00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:34,220
details for all of your environments

00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:36,590
makes my life easier makes your life

00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,850
easier so config management all the

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,770
things it doesn't matter if you're using

00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:42,650
chef or puppet or a school or salt or

00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:45,970
whatever it just matters that you know

00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:49,970
things can be and all are automated and

00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:52,970
moving on to again logs seem to get

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:55,370
common topic I would love to see logs

00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:57,560
for previous deploys there there there

00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:59,960
text files they're very simple they're

00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,330
very small they compress well disk is

00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,800
dirt cheap I've seen SSDs for less than

00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:08,950
a dollar a gigabyte you have no excuse

00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,950
you really have no excuse right now for

00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:23,780
to say bye-bye a USB Drive really yep

00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,820
smart off smart olas runs off of a USB

00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,090
so you can put your logs there so anyway

00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:31,700
vlogs for previous deploys so we know

00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:33,800
what happens if anything failed maybe

00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,200
this maybe you're deploying something

00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,690
over the network and your deployment

00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,880
tool will drop files if there is a

00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:44,030
network problem my boss was in that

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,800
situation it happens so being able to

00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,150
have logs for stuff that's dropped on

00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,610
the floor where the breaks otherwise

00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:52,850
would have saved my boss in this case a

00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:55,700
lot of time so being able to have that

00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:57,830
kind of thing to look at it will give

00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,390
you more information and information

00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:06,050
knowledge is power so GI Joe all that

00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:08,830
right so start and stop minutes there's

00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:13,310
you know many different ways to do this

00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:16,610
independent of the Pearl options there

00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:18,890
you know SMF which is a limos Solaris

00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:23,630
kind of thing there's run it which is

00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:26,810
you know the sort of more same daemon

00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:29,390
tools there's daemon tools there's plain

00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:31,250
init script which isn't so plain if

00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:32,780
anyone has ever actually used more than

00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,210
one unit system they're not so plain and

00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:39,470
they're not so standard

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:41,870
yeah so you know sorry right so you know

00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:45,170
there's also demon control which is a

00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:47,270
pearl thing which it's okay I mean if I

00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:50,200
can't have SMF I would like to have

00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:53,270
daemon tools or evening not human tools

00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,620
I would like to have demon control

00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,870
because it's simple and consistent

00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,700
across all of pearl I would recommend

00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:01,000
you take a look at it on CPM it is

00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,560
written by someone who has a clue right

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,750
so also you know I need to know where

00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,390
this tooling is to actually start the

00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,760
application so tell me where it is why

00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:13,760
can you start it seems obvious but you'd

00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,800
be surprised does it need to run as a

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,540
specific user does it have any specific

00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,340
environment variables and it needs as

00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,500
you need any configuration files doesn't

00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,450
need any ports open so on so forth

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,100
everything you need to know to run the

00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,960
app I need to know that for the start of

00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:29,710
something is of course me no

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,490
dependencies as usual too common theme

00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:36,140
so back to two logs all of the blocks

00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:39,140
make sure your app does right looks

00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:42,680
please I'll be sad you know what would

00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:47,630
be sad right so tell me you know where

00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:51,770
the logs are make sure that we know what

00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:54,560
is logged and what isn't more what isn't

00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:56,630
then what is because if I'm looking for

00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,580
something in the logs and I don't know

00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,690
that it's not supposed to be there I'm

00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,580
going to be spending an awful lot of

00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,320
time looking for it expecting to find it

00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,480
and if I don't find it I'm going to

00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,570
panic as I'm going to panic you get the

00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:12,800
phone call so let me know you know what

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:15,710
is logs and a zip for retention and

00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,840
space requirements for rotation now this

00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:21,880
is not just something that applies to

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:25,180
disk space but in question in the back

00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:28,570
this also applies to regulatory

00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:30,970
environments such as PCI or other

00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:33,230
standards or standards-based

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,880
environments where you need to have data

00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,160
available for a certain amount of time

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,110
and you need to call it after a certain

00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:42,020
amount of time so communicating that to

00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:44,030
us we can you know provision disks

00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,740
properly and make sure that we're not

00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:48,620
rotating your logs too soon

00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,940
you get fine we get fined with a PCI

00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:55,370
order violation or something like that

00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:57,020
is useful so okay all of this mean our

00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,990
general communication if you do deploys

00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:03,470
please tell us at least the on-call

00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:05,809
person so they know what's happening so

00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:07,309
when the service flaps and adios or

00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:12,140
whatever you're using says it goes down

00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:13,970
they don't freak out too much keep

00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:17,200
people informed you know about what

00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:20,360
changes there was an article in

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:24,620
communications of the ACM recently where

00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:27,500
the writer spoke wrote about the sulfur

00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:29,929
process for the space shuttle they did

00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:32,540
things in a very water fall fashion all

00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:34,730
the requirements upfront requirements

00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,500
finished before design design finished

00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,510
before implementation and you're

00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,179
thinking oh well wow that would be nice

00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:44,179
if we could do that but we're agile ya

00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:46,309
know they had over 2,000 changes over

00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:47,929
six years to their requirements they

00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:50,360
just kept updating it as it were going

00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:54,559
so it's not traditional waterfall they

00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:56,150
did react to changes and it doesn't

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,120
matter what which methodology you're

00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:01,070
using it doesn't matter you know what

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,080
you're doing how you're doing it we need

00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,670
to know you know things change because

00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,350
if thing if we don't do the things

00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:08,450
change like mechanized for example from

00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,730
earlier today you're going to have your

00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,870
code broken and it won't be our fault it

00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,750
won't be your fault it will be the

00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:16,490
processes fault so you know let us know

00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,429
what's going on don't keep things to

00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:21,290
yourself just don't communicate too much

00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:26,240
because how many people here get too

00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:29,000
much email yeah yeah look around and

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,770
that's that's too much email that you're

00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,200
going to look at it market is read

00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:35,150
without reading it if it's critical your

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,620
boss comes to you and say says did you

00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:43,100
read that my must it by market is red

00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:45,680
oops so there you go something that I'm

00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,860
pushing at work myself is to lower the

00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:50,690
email but it's slow so don't overdo it

00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,370
or else you'll be in a situation where

00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:57,500
you have filters to marks off his red

00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:59,900
not that I do that nope right so getting

00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:03,050
back to the importance of logging not

00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:06,200
just where to put it it is documentation

00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:08,510
of the current status of your

00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,159
application it is documentation of the

00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,889
current health of the application of

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:16,460
what it's doing and as we get to you

00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:20,210
later good post mortems really depend on

00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:23,179
all kinds of vlogs from everything

00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,320
involved and in some cases like the

00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:28,280
colonel bug that i was talking about

00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,860
before this can go to the level of a

00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,659
kernel crash dump so I'm not really

00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,879
saying you know that I expect you to be

00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:37,370
able to debug a kernel crash don't but

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:41,659
being able to have all that information

00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:46,340
available is very useful and if

00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:49,669
documentation is a love letter then

00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:51,800
similarly the logs are a pulse to come

00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:55,580
also write from the heart what I mean by

00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:57,530
this is that logs tell you the health of

00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:59,900
the application what it's doing what

00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,090
it's thinking how it's moving from one

00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,170
state to another so having that kind of

00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:07,790
information just don't overdo it is

00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:11,530
really really important I cannot say how

00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:14,570
many times good logs really helped me to

00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:16,880
quickly identify what's happening I mean

00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,950
a good error message even excuse me

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,070
would be really really useful can't

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:23,510
locate food p.m. in a tink that tells

00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,450
you everything you need to know it

00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,070
doesn't really communicate much to

00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,420
someone who doesn't know pearl but as

00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,400
I'll be lightning talking about later

00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,700
today people should be pehle cuts even

00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:38,840
not today but in by the way so yes

00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:40,540
logging is love letter right so as for

00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:44,530
doing the post-mortems as i just said

00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:48,080
the first rule of post mortems is don't

00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:51,350
assign blame the second rule of post

00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:53,570
mortems is don't assign blame

00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:57,860
the third rule is don't mention the word

00:35:53,570 --> 00:36:02,750
blame and when you do that it becomes

00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:05,030
not an ego thing it becomes a technical

00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:06,350
engineering process which is where we

00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:10,070
need to be to actually address the

00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:12,230
problems that we have so one thing that

00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:15,860
I've read that I've tried to do do some

00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:19,100
success is keep asking why until you get

00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:21,260
to a root cause the say for example the

00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:24,800
web server went down well why we just

00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:28,280
felt filled by logs why no look no

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,820
rotation why we forgot or whatever so

00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,930
you know document everything you find

00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:36,260
including you know steps taken to

00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:38,630
prevent recurrence and going back to the

00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,570
space shuttle program that I talked

00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:44,390
about a little earlier the way they did

00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:47,120
those mortems and other sort of

00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:49,780
troubleshooting was not to blame the

00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:53,120
people but rather to blame the process

00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:56,030
the process is what allowed the problem

00:36:53,120 --> 00:37:00,470
to happen in the first place and if you

00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:02,960
fix your process then human error then

00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:05,510
human error will decrease because it

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,720
won't be possible in the process for

00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:10,610
that kind of human error to crop up so

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,310
if you can you know fix your process and

00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:15,320
prevent things from happening again

00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:17,150
which is going back to the github

00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,150
example I like to pick on them but they

00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:22,730
do post-mortem very well and they did a

00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:24,560
good job of preventing what their their

00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:27,280
screw off from happening again so I have

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,460
to give them respect in that regard so

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:38,420
you know make the blogs for post mortems

00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:40,990
easily found and searchable so so far so

00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:46,960
good so far so good any questions on

00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:46,960
social aspects yes no

00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:58,660
okay all right unfortunately you can't

00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:02,910
see it very well but that is an old

00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,910
school son pizza box of course

00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:09,249
unfortunately no no hey there is it's a

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:16,289
quote from the monitor there's not going

00:38:09,249 --> 00:38:19,989
to be a cat there yes sorry I'm not sure

00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:23,589
not sure the there's some or the link to

00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:24,759
the Flickr page with the photo in the

00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:30,339
slides you can go there if you want

00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:33,759
right so as I alluded to earlier there

00:38:30,339 --> 00:38:37,140
are some specific technologies that will

00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:40,150
make things a lot easier for us and for

00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:44,410
you really because it you know it's all

00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:47,650
about being able to be moving quickly

00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:49,779
responding quickly to demands from your

00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:53,019
clients from your customers and from

00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:55,900
your business people so technology helps

00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:58,119
with technology problems obviously one

00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,489
would hope so you know a lot of these

00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:04,779
are examples of ideas and what I mean by

00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:07,089
examples of ideas is that they are

00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:08,529
specific implementations things that I

00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:12,690
am familiar with things that i have used

00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:16,959
well but i'm not really endorsing them

00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:18,640
in most cases just you know find

00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:20,739
something that works for you as with

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,059
everything else don't just pick

00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:23,109
something because i talked about it

00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:25,150
don't just pick something because it's

00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:30,969
popular pick something because you can

00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:33,640
evaluate it in a technical logical way

00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:36,069
to prove that it is good for your

00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,809
environment you know pick the best tool

00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:40,779
for the job UNIX philosophy for the

00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:41,799
wedding this won't be a how-to for the

00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:43,839
technologies that i'm going to be

00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:45,789
talking about there are docked for that

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,979
and some of them there are talks later

00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:49,029
at this conference for the texts that

00:39:47,979 --> 00:39:51,609
are going to be talking about and i will

00:39:49,029 --> 00:39:53,589
believe i will be pointing those out so

00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:55,269
you know go see the talks read the

00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:56,769
documentation if you have questions here

00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:57,290
there are communities for all of these

00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,720
things

00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:02,860
to help you out so don't feel that you

00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,860
need to figure it out all on your own

00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:11,900
oops see if I was introspective I would

00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:13,600
have fixed that right so sorry

00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:21,890
miniatures collection for introspection

00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:23,510
yes yes hmm right so is there anyone

00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:27,410
here who knows what the term telemetry

00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:29,180
is in terms of an application no no okay

00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:31,160
so telemetry in terms of an application

00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:33,650
is a lot of what I've already said

00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:37,040
basically which is how its performing

00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:40,400
what it's doing what the metrics are for

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,500
its performance what's going wrong it's

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,570
it's generally the idea of applying

00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:48,500
telemetry from an aircraft to a software

00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:51,320
program making both crash so you know

00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,930
it's it's really really very basic stuff

00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:57,410
for how the application is what it's

00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:59,720
doing and its really really critical to

00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:03,770
have this kind of thing both from an

00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:05,840
average perspective from a developer's

00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:09,680
perspective and from businesspersons

00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:12,470
reflective there is very little real

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,360
metrics very little concentration on

00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,850
business metrics for applications

00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,700
something that I think really needs to

00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:22,550
change so you know something I have a

00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:25,790
run a lot and there are some tools for

00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:28,870
introspection of course like stats d

00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:35,350
Andrew Hobbs rutland is doing a talk i

00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:39,170
think wednesday on this and stats d is

00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:41,540
really very simple it's a essentially a

00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:45,860
little oversimplifying it's a key value

00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:49,190
sort of streaming system for doing

00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:51,680
counters and that kind of thing counters

00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:53,870
and metrics for your application you

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,080
just fire stuff off to a server and it

00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:59,210
reads it in and does stuff with it I

00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:02,090
think the official canonical

00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:03,800
implementation is for graphite right but

00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,549
you can read it in from a bunch of other

00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,249
things

00:42:04,549 --> 00:42:10,849
including logstash which is wonderful so

00:42:07,249 --> 00:42:16,749
dtrace is another tool that if you can

00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:20,179
use it you will it is sort of like

00:42:16,749 --> 00:42:23,269
seeing all the pieces fall together in

00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:27,729
Tetris forming for line 10 dresses all

00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:31,969
the time you can basically go from

00:42:27,729 --> 00:42:34,189
everything from at level logic to right

00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:36,499
above the electrons moving in your

00:42:34,189 --> 00:42:39,109
hardware with T trace in production

00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:42,859
without performance penalties it is a

00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:46,189
godsend I'd love it if you can use it do

00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:49,160
so linux alternative is system tap if

00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:50,989
you're looking to do if you're looking

00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,359
to really begin to what your system is

00:42:50,989 --> 00:42:56,779
doing on a Linux environments if you're

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:59,929
not doing the limo sore solaris or PSD

00:42:56,779 --> 00:43:02,299
or OS 10 you have system that all linux

00:42:59,929 --> 00:43:04,069
if you want to do that mark allen is

00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:07,759
going to be giving a lovely talk

00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:11,839
tomorrow I think on dtrace I heartily

00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:13,549
recommend you go if not only to learn

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,900
about what it is because it really

00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,880
changes how you think about to some

00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:20,299
introspection and then there's you know

00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:23,089
monitoring tools like Cirque onus which

00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:25,549
is what my employer develops dodgy o

00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:28,729
sistema zabbix etc etc you know there's

00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:34,369
just 12 dozen of these and it's not

00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:37,819
really important to Rose yes and it's

00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:41,239
not really important which application

00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:43,489
you're using rather than you know that

00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:44,929
you're actually having monitoring so

00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:49,569
just pick something that works for you

00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:49,569
and go with it and there are more

00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:54,289
hackish you could say sorts of ways of

00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:56,900
doing something like a control socket

00:43:54,289 --> 00:43:58,939
for unix or the Apache scoreboard that

00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,759
kind of thing so it doesn't really

00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:03,499
matter you know what tools you're using

00:44:01,759 --> 00:44:04,609
so long as they work for what kind of

00:44:03,499 --> 00:44:07,969
information you want to get out of your

00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:10,699
application so that's D it is you know

00:44:07,969 --> 00:44:12,199
project by etsy they do crafts stuff and

00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:14,660
their office some amazing if you ever

00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:15,970
get a chance to go they are it is a

00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:19,530
language-independent

00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:22,960
means of counters and timing information

00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:25,480
so you just fire stuff off to a server

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,280
and mind if one goes to graphite but you

00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,290
don't have to do graphite it's very

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,590
lightweight and simple Sanders talk for

00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:35,980
more he is awesome dtrace it is

00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:38,920
wonderful and I said before that it is

00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:42,970
it goes from your application to your

00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:47,950
hardware so DTrace itself is on its own

00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:49,900
it's meant for syscall c library lower

00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:52,510
level stuff in your application but

00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:54,640
there is a project by chris allen leave

00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:57,670
us dt which allows you to write probes

00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,170
in perl mark will probably be talking

00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:02,260
about that if not all but i will be

00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:05,190
asking him as i said this system tap for

00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:08,020
linux i don't think there's a us dt or

00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:12,130
equivalent for system tab not sure it's

00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:15,010
less mature it's not as old monitoring

00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:17,440
packages yes so you know it doesn't

00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:20,230
really matter what the tooling is helps

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,730
to know what to monitor which we require

00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:24,430
as a communication that I described

00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:26,320
earlier if everyone is in a room saying

00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:29,440
these stats are important from my

00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,690
application then you know from beginning

00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,820
what you need to monitor which if you

00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:36,130
have bad monitoring it's worse than none

00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:38,230
because it gives you a false sense of

00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:40,810
security that everything is fine and

00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:43,500
then things could be on fire ll be 0 on

00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:47,380
fire yeah

00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:50,380
right so you know and more importantly

00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:52,660
than this even is that if you have a

00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,970
monitoring system you need to make sure

00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,819
the alerts go to the right people I've

00:45:54,970 --> 00:46:00,579
more than once gotten an alert that was

00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:02,859
for maybe a dev environment or something

00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:06,630
that I wasn't able to fix for whatever

00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:10,089
reason that alert is worse than useless

00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:11,619
because it wastes my time it wasted time

00:46:10,089 --> 00:46:14,050
the person who's supposed to be fixing

00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:16,540
it waste of time with a person who set

00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:19,260
it up and so on so forth in addition to

00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:23,800
not actually solving a problem so

00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:25,839
monitoring is such an enormous topic it

00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,150
actually has its only conference these

00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:30,400
days it is such an enormous topic and I

00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:32,170
could go on at length all day about

00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,809
monitoring find me in the hallway if you

00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:36,730
want to talk about it so you know what

00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:39,609
metrics to make available as i said

00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:42,790
before business metrics I can't give you

00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:45,339
advice here every app has its own

00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:47,559
business requirements I cannot really

00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:50,589
say you should be monitoring this

00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:52,990
because this may not apply to you so

00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:55,599
talk to your business people ask them

00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:58,180
what's important in their application so

00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,859
they know that it's working well in a

00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:03,000
general application health I have gone

00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:07,000
over this from so I'm tree at except for

00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:10,829
trend whatever is important which I've

00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,599
mentioned before so have graphs for

00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:16,000
knowing how much disk you're using how

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,010
much network you're using over time so

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,510
you can react more intelligently so you

00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:24,130
can project what's going on and you know

00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:26,049
with all this information that you're

00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:28,329
pulling in you might be thinking well

00:47:26,049 --> 00:47:30,400
gee Chris it's nice that you're telling

00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:32,650
me to collect all this data but what the

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,390
am I going to do with it all how am I

00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:36,490
going to use it so there's this

00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:38,680
wonderful guy jordan says oh and he

00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:42,700
created something called log stash which

00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:45,640
is the it is an evolution of syslog i

00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:49,299
like to say what i mean by that is that

00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,490
it takes an input from any protocol you

00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:54,450
can care to mention

00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:56,550
and it has filters in it outputs that's

00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:58,710
all it does it is very simple very

00:47:56,550 --> 00:48:02,010
eunuch see and I cannot recommend

00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:04,950
logstash enough it will make it you can

00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:06,810
basically centralize all your logs from

00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:08,460
your entire organization in log stash

00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:10,650
and make them searchable which is what

00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,050
we're working towards from a TI it is

00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:16,260
very extensible it's written in JRuby

00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:19,260
which Ruby's not so bad you can stone me

00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:21,720
now I will say though that it is still

00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:25,590
growing up and there's a data schema

00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:27,869
change coming soon however there will be

00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:29,760
tooling to move your data forward if you

00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:36,680
get deep into log stash before the

00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:40,890
schema change happens yes log mg o

00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:46,740
syslog-ng the syslog ng do things like

00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:50,400
read from amqp interesting interesting

00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:55,500
does it do HTTP json filtering so on so

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,960
forth interesting interesting I haven't

00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,609
really looked very much at it but thank

00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,430
you that will go in the next edition of

00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:03,840
the talk thank you as I said you know

00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:06,330
locks ash is still growing up it is a

00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:09,450
very rapidly moving project so keep that

00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:10,440
in mind when you look to adopt it you

00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:14,760
know what about keeping the app running

00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:16,080
hmm you know making sure that there are

00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,290
different ways to make sure that the

00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:21,840
application is running there are you

00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:24,210
know you can steal the seeking fo trick

00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:26,910
from BSD where you send a signal T

00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:29,700
application and it prints out some 2103

00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:32,070
information like CPU usage and the font

00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,540
the cisco that it seemed presently to a

00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:36,600
log file that kind of thing might be

00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:39,180
useful certain restart management which

00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:41,220
is goes back to the tooling we were

00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:43,650
talking about before cluster management

00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:46,320
like load balancers and fun exhale

00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:47,970
ability and the solaris high

00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,030
availability you know those kind of

00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:52,140
things are pretty important so help to

00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,920
your system in about this kind of thing

00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:56,680
that's generally where they're going

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,230
to be right signal Management as I said

00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:03,549
you know sig info is useful and

00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:05,470
something I want to hit upon is the

00:50:03,549 --> 00:50:08,170
importance to if you're in a units

00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:09,339
environment the importance I can see you

00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:12,960
know talking about the importance to

00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:18,190
distinguish between sigterm and sig kill

00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:23,579
term is politely saying please clean up

00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:26,859
I'm about to end you kill is obvious

00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:29,290
kill should be obvious so if you're

00:50:26,859 --> 00:50:30,940
wondering how this works most units

00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:34,270
operating systems have init scripts

00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:36,700
that's in term wait a little bit then

00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:38,410
send kill yeah I be idea being to give

00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,819
someone give the application a chance to

00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,369
clean up I for itself close its log

00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:44,140
files so data gets flushed close its

00:50:42,369 --> 00:50:46,660
other data files so stuff gets flushed

00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:51,280
and not exit in an inconsistent state

00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:53,650
kill is very abrupt its kill it's you

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:56,200
know what it says on the tin so you know

00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:57,609
make sure that you are your application

00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,589
if you're going to be using these

00:50:57,609 --> 00:51:02,349
eunuchs up signals make sure that you

00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:04,530
handle them correctly any unix system it

00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:07,270
will be able to give you a lecture on

00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:08,470
what the signals are and how you should

00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:12,670
be using them and how you're doing it

00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:15,040
wrong so yes getting the bits in place

00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:17,200
you know I mentioned most of this

00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:20,020
already there's you know many different

00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,119
ways to do it get CPM Jenkins that I

00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:23,710
have opinions all the other admins in

00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:25,480
this room have opinions they will not be

00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:28,299
the same that's okay listen to what your

00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:30,730
up in says it's just important you know

00:51:28,299 --> 00:51:33,040
to reach some kind of agreement and be

00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:35,530
consistent because if your applications

00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:39,099
are deployed six different ways that's

00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:42,730
12 different ways that it will break so

00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:47,049
you know simple communication consensus

00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:49,270
and yes lots of tools for starting

00:51:47,049 --> 00:51:52,390
stopping applications things like daemon

00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:55,650
tools SMF run it Gaming Control up start

00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:58,540
again consistent your admin will have

00:51:55,650 --> 00:52:00,760
suggestions on it and I mentioning these

00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:02,920
tools so that you can be familiar with

00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,290
them so that you can learn how they work

00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,619
in case you need to do whatever with

00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:07,960
them

00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:09,849
so that you know they exist so that you

00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,960
know how they work what kind of

00:52:09,849 --> 00:52:13,499
expectations they have for your

00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,359
applications so you can build them

00:52:13,499 --> 00:52:19,390
intelligently based on the assumptions

00:52:16,359 --> 00:52:21,640
they make you know there's also things

00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:23,710
like cluster management and there's

00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,569
different tools for that like Linux high

00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:28,180
availability Patrick traffic server

00:52:25,569 --> 00:52:29,559
dedicated load balancers I like Zeus

00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:32,349
because the scripting language is rather

00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:33,759
like pearl so I'm a little biased there

00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:36,400
are you know dedicated tools for this

00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:39,609
again consistency I'm consistent about

00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,970
consistency if nothing else and yes so

00:52:39,609 --> 00:52:45,130
that's pretty much everything so any

00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:47,769
questions on what I've covered I've

00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:50,859
covered a lot of stuff very quickly so

00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:54,839
any questions or comments we're

00:52:50,859 --> 00:53:02,490
concerned or tomatoes or fro faces or

00:52:54,839 --> 00:53:04,509
stone silence okay okay yes in the back

00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:06,490
question was are the slides available

00:53:04,509 --> 00:53:07,900
online and they will be five minutes

00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:12,670
after I disconnect my computer to push

00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:15,910
them up and make the Republic many other

00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:18,220
questions comments concerns no yes I

00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:20,470
will actually offer a suggestion you're

00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:23,829
saying talking about communicating

00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:25,960
between for deployment processes etc

00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:29,410
allow me to recommend the book the

00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:33,489
checklist manifesto I forget who the

00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:36,270
author's name is but it's developed from

00:53:33,489 --> 00:53:38,100
like the tools used in sir

00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:41,160
and high-powered hospitals and like

00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:43,230
flight engineers for air airports the

00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,480
control masters manifesto the check

00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:47,160
check check list checklist manifesto

00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:51,960
unless you're where I got cool minutes

00:53:47,160 --> 00:54:00,260
are from doing too much SSH okay so

00:53:51,960 --> 00:54:03,840
checklist manifesto by a tool go 1d okay

00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:07,160
okay okay very good very good thank you

00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:11,040
thank you any other questions comments

00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:15,990
yeah several all at once I think here's

00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:25,980
what it first yes looking for long-range

00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:28,650
that have a project Elsa for a GPL

00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:40,620
logstash a like you said yeah I'm

00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:44,130
question over here so let me make sure I

00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:45,810
understand let me make sure I understand

00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:49,260
the question and repeat it you're asking

00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:51,390
how to ensure the developers actually

00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:53,570
read the documentation for the admins

00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:53,570
rather

00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:05,310
that is more a cultural problem and

00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:08,430
really it comes down to they should be

00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:10,590
more professional than that so if

00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:13,050
they're if they care about their job

00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:15,050
they should know this kind of thing and

00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:18,050
they should read the documentation

00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:18,050
