welcome to start contributing to pearl

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:12,120
it's easy it's so easy i'm gonna show

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,740
you in the next few slides um so my name

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,289
is augustina rag whatz you can call me

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,119
Auggie for short a little bit about me

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,689
so I'm I've only been a pearl developer

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,630
since 2007 my first EFC was last year

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,890
and I came to FC with this goal of I

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,939
really want to start contributing to the

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,949
community at that point had been

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,590
programming in Perl for you know a few

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,300
years and you know it's just really

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,520
excited about you know wanting to give

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,380
back to open source and you know in Perl

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,420
there's so much tribal knowledge it is

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,550
not so straightforward you know you keep

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,750
like for instance and ricardo's talk you

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,489
heard ya contribute contribute

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,280
contribute and it's you know my big

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,200
question was like okay how you know

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,460
we're where or what do I contribute so

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,460
so that's where I got the inspiration

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:57,390
for this talk and I hope I hope it's

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,399
useful and a couple other things I

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,410
currently work at mediamath I in New

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,550
York City we're hiring if you have any

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,040
questions about that I want to talk

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,080
about that feel free to chase me down

00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,790
after the talk and then here's some

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,140
contact information for me if you have

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,299
questions and maybe you're a little too

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,369
shy to ask in a big group or whatever

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,920
you know feel free to contact me via any

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,270
of these means and also i will be

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,070
uploading these slides and i'll go ahead

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,380
and post it on twitter with like a

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,200
hashtag yap see so you'll be able to

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,200
find it that way or I'll send it to them

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,259
email list too all right let me get on

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,460
the right screen so I can change slides

00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:36,299
um all right oh yeah so I just uh just

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,920
talked about those why am i giving this

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,799
talk so I just made my first

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,329
contributions my first contributions

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,310
have been really small you know little

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,530
documentation patches you know nothing

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,450
profound but the way that I see it is

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,040
you know I spent about 15 to 20 minutes

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,530
you know trying to look for information

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,869
because of a poor documentation patch

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,430
and so now I've saved somebody that 15

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,560
or 20 minutes by making that small

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,329
documentation patch so I would really

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,340
like to share what I've learned with all

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,899
of you and hopefully it'll inspire some

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,280
of you who've been like me involved in

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,770
Perl for a while and really wanted to

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,819
give back to the community to you know

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,170
do something so yes pearl wants you so

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,710
here's my little spiel about why you

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,420
should come

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,060
you to open source projects because open

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,340
source is free but there is a cost and

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,990
so I like to equate it's a public radio

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:27,390
although it is more like public access

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:28,950
TV so you know pay your dues through

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,600
contributions I mean generally like you

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,790
hear on public radio you know like oh

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,490
you know we need funds we need funds

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,710
well open source you know we we need you

00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,390
know we need contributions so it's

00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,970
really awesome do it because it's fun

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,500
makes your resume look cool maybe you

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,090
want some experience and some other

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,090
things that you're not getting through

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,000
your day-to-day work you know contribute

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,790
to open source all right spiel over

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,170
start small so one of the biggest things

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,420
that you can do to get started with

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,130
contributing is to get familiar with the

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,440
patching process first by making small

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,420
contribution so you know do small code

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,040
patches maybe there's like something

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,450
really minor a little typo in a variable

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,700
name or some really simple refactoring

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,200
documentation patches excellent and also

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,330
unit tests or an excellent way to start

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,680
learning about you know some new context

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,300
and then here's another little thing

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,280
remember working in a new code based

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,740
requires context so don't be intimidated

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,090
if you're really interested in learning

00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,560
more about say asynchronous programming

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,870
and you're like why I'd really love to

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,310
hack on any event you know it'd be

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,510
realistic you know it's going to be a

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,590
little scary at first when you're

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,480
getting in there but don't let it

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,640
intimidate you you know start with again

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,500
unit tests documentation patches see if

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,300
there's anything small that you can get

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,400
start with it started with while you're

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,900
you know getting to learn the context of

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,890
you know the code environment you're

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,120
working in another great thing so I was

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,940
surprised there's a lot of people that

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,370
actually don't know about IRC so I are

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,280
see if you're not familiar with it IRC

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,840
dr. Loar pretty much you know a lot of

00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,820
Sipan modules you'll see them in the

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,010
documentation and various other pearl

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,230
projects have channels in IRC I

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,810
recommend starting places as pound pearl

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:10,050
help or p5p people in there generally

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,520
very nice and very helpful so you know

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,170
feel free to go to those places if you

00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,000
do have questions and I'll give more

00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,620
explicit directions to two different

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,830
things as I talk about more specifically

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,210
pro core and CPM contribution so where

00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,640
can I contribute to pearl so this talk

00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,980
I'm going to talk about contributing to

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,410
see pan and also touch

00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,150
how to contribute to pro-poor and again

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,310
this is all very high level you know

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,100
very simple if you want to do anything

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,840
you know more hardcore and heavy you

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,340
know maybe this this talk might be a

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,560
little bit basic but at least it'll get

00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:43,130
you started and kind of see where to go

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,860
to get ideas and just to get started all

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:49,340
right so just to touch on pro core is

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:53,170
called or profile Porter's it's located

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:55,730
at dev org there's also the mailing list

00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:58,250
pro/5 Porter's subscribe is how you can

00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,050
get your your email added to the mailing

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,910
list so you can listen in on many

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,760
discussions and contribute there's also

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,700
a great IRC channel so let me flip over

00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:10,850
and show you guys the uh this is the

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,160
wrong one um so here this is this is the

00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,930
web page for Pearl 5 you'll see there's

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,270
already some links to some various

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,050
documents I'm here that are really

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,370
helpful and it's a good starting point

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:26,510
for learning more about contributing to

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:28,790
pro core let's see oh yeah so a good

00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,320
reason to contribute a pro core pumpkins

00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,000
is a rotating group of individuals I

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,380
think right now it's it's or jbs i

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,110
should say i think right now it's are

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,170
dubious for cobbling together changes

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,270
and releasing new pearl versions patches

00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,860
go into new versions of pearls so even

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,660
if you submit a small documentation

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,340
patch your name goes into the release

00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,880
stock and you are immortalized forever

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:54,800
as being a perl contributor put it on

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:56,540
your LinkedIn profile it's great um yeah

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,430
so that sounds really cool so now what

00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,440
well like I said before look for things

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,150
that are easy to contribute easy equals

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,130
small fixes for learning the patching

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,780
process you don't have to know c

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,510
programming to contribute to pro court

00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,220
again you can make documentation patches

00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,990
you can patch supporting scripts a lot

00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,250
of stuff in pro core there's actually

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,440
little Perl scripts that do things like

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,120
for instance pod generation is done by a

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,770
perl script it's a patch that i started

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,350
working on because there were a couple

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,030
you know reg axes that were in separate

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,350
places that were doing the same thing i

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,790
thought well i could refactor this and

00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,740
put this into a single subroutine

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,300
awesome makes the code maintainable and

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,550
teaches me a little bit about you know

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,920
the patching process improve unit test

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,300
coverage this is kind of neat so there

00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,759
are some bugs that have been

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:41,300
a ganar t and so i'll go ahead and show

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,009
you guys that list so RT is profile core

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,810
all the places are all the bugs and

00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:47,090
everything are tracked through RT and

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,150
you can see that's linked here on the on

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:53,930
the page but I also have it in my buffer

00:06:50,150 --> 00:07:00,169
because I've been having flaky flaky

00:06:53,930 --> 00:07:01,659
internet there it is so this is a great

00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:05,960
tag there's a bunch of beginning

00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:08,870
beginning things here that you know that

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,039
have been tagged and so could a nice so

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,629
these are some good starting points

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:13,699
another great starting point is the to

00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:16,099
do list so there is an official to-do

00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,240
list it's a pretty long document but

00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:20,000
it's worth a read if you're just looking

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,210
for ideas so here's the to do list it's

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,210
in the in the git repository for pearl

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,849
and so there's a huge long list of all

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,949
kinds of things from was a you know

00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:34,699
custom tap generation automate pearl

00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:37,280
delta generation makes for emporer write

00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:39,469
descriptions for tests I mean you know

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,029
just all kinds of stuff in here so again

00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:43,460
if you're looking for ideas you know

00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:46,460
that's a that's a really good place to

00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,810
get some inspiration so how do you

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,490
contribute to the pro core well they've

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,930
done a really good job of document so

00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,190
I'm just kind of I'm just going to walk

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,930
through the documentation and I actually

00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:58,699
try to do a live demo of doing a pro

00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:59,569
core patch I'm not that awesome but i'll

00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:02,599
go ahead and show you guys the

00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:04,909
documentation it's a pro doc pearl that

00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:07,009
org pearl hacked HTML I know Ricardo

00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:09,110
mentioned pearl hack toot I think pearl

00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:10,940
hack is a little bit nicer especially if

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,000
you're brand new I'm and just looking

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:19,190
for again like a getting started thing

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,529
so go ahead and show you guys that was

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,289
the to do here we go so this is the

00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:26,539
pearl hack and if you go to the section

00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:28,610
super quick patch guide it's really

00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:31,310
great so first thing you do is you clone

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:34,070
the git repo make your change hack hack

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,539
hack test your change and this is a

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,190
really awesome place even if you're not

00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:38,959
sure that you want to contribute to pro

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,579
core it is kind of fun to just clone the

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,990
repo and run the test and just see if

00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:44,120
anything breaks locally on your machine

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,649
and if something does then that's an

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,029
opportunity for a bug or maybe

00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:48,589
even a patch that you can contribute to

00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,029
pearl core you know it makes you feel

00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:52,129
super awesome because you just

00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:55,389
downloaded pearl from the repo and and

00:08:52,129 --> 00:09:02,629
built it on your machine so anyways I

00:08:55,389 --> 00:09:05,179
get excited by my things and then

00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:07,129
finally commit your change there's a

00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:09,339
nifty little tool called pearl bug which

00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:12,110
should come with your pearl installation

00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:13,639
and you can use that and so what that'll

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,179
do is it'll it'll create an hour T

00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:20,420
ticket there is also a page here on

00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:22,459
pearl bug within the documentation this

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,319
is also a really good documentation page

00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:26,420
to read it has a description of how

00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:28,249
pearl bug works if pearl bug is not

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,249
working on your system some workarounds

00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:32,629
and when reporting a bug please run

00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:34,249
through this checklist so there's a

00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:35,660
really nice description of you know even

00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:37,639
if you're nervous about you know just

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,769
reporting a bug and you know you you

00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:41,689
want to make sure you do it right you

00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:43,309
know there's a whole whole bunch of

00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:46,129
great stuff here I think applicable to

00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:48,170
reporting bugs in general you know good

00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:50,509
stuff so pro cores done a great job of

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,980
providing lots of documentation it's

00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:53,809
just a matter of finding it and knowing

00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,269
you know what to find that's useful so

00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:59,660
hopefully these docs will give you a

00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:02,300
good a good starting point so yeah so

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:06,410
that was the short walk through of the

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:08,389
docks alright so that's pro/5 corn in

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,610
nutshell again like I said this is just

00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:12,559
gonna be a basic uh you know just just

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,990
how to get your feet wet so now I'm

00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,519
going to talk about Sipan and Sipan I'm

00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,889
going to talk about a couple of things

00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,540
before I started contributing and

00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:22,370
actually got maintainer on some modules

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,160
there's a lot about cpn that i did not

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,019
know for about five years i just went to

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,819
see pan to see you know if i needed to

00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,019
do something it was like all right did

00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:31,850
somebody already write something for

00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:34,189
this okay awesome i'm gonna use it and

00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,290
so when I got to a place where I wanted

00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:38,059
to start contributing you know I learned

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,339
all of these things you know all these

00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:42,439
different aspects of Sipan so in a

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:44,720
nutshell of Sipan is the place where

00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:47,779
modules live it's an index that will map

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,639
module name to file archive location and

00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,369
i highly recommend if you're not using

00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,559
medicean absolutely you should be using

00:10:52,369 --> 00:10:56,689
medicine pan because meta Sipan in

00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,850
addition to all the basic module in for

00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,529
me

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,389
and that's on Sipan there's a lot of

00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:01,889
meta information there and especially if

00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:03,750
you're looking to contribute to a Sipan

00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:07,920
module I'll show you why that's that's

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:10,050
really really nice to have so so where

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,430
do the the actual files live if Sipan is

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,709
just the index well there's a server

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,930
called pause that's the Pearl authors

00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:17,459
upload server you actually don't need an

00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,949
account on this server in order to

00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:21,990
contribute in order to patch a module

00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:24,329
you really only need it if somehow you

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,620
magically become maintainer and even if

00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:26,639
you just want to patch a module I'll

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,160
talk about how that could possibly

00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:32,579
happen to you which you know see it as

00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,410
an opportunity and this is located at

00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:38,730
paws dog pearl work and so I'll show you

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:41,639
guys what that looks like let's see so

00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,380
here's pause this is where if you are a

00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:46,019
cpn module maintainer you could

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,449
potentially manually upload things here

00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:50,940
I personally preferred to still up but

00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:53,009
that's me and then you can also do

00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,899
account management if you want to have

00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:56,610
somebody so if a module maintainer wants

00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,019
to add you know somebody is a cow

00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:01,019
maintainer they would do it through the

00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:02,759
pause in her face so that's just kind of

00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:05,160
an FYI something cool I didn't know

00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,689
about until I started becoming a more

00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,939
active contributor now one of my

00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:11,069
favorite things Sipan testers so the

00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:12,839
goal of Sipan testers is to test Sipan

00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:15,149
modules with as many versions and

00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:18,420
configurations of pearl as possible and

00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:19,980
as many platforms as possible so if you

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,779
this is really actually a great

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,939
opportunity to contribute if you have a

00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:26,069
special need like say you have some kind

00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:28,259
of a special you know server you know

00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:29,759
operating system or whatever and you

00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:32,130
know you have a lot of issues with Sipan

00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,199
module compatibilities this is a great

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,029
opportunity to contribute to see pan

00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:38,730
testers by you know doing some testing

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:41,189
on your particular platform and I don't

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:44,120
know where's guru is he is he in the

00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:48,209
room I thought I saw him a second ago oh

00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,649
oh there's guru so here if you guys are

00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:52,860
interested in learning more about Sipan

00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:55,139
testers that's the guy to talk to and

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,750
I'll show you guys some cool stuff so

00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:01,500
they have I have the cpn testers website

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,880
up and it's just Sipan testers org and

00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,949
this is kind of neat because they have

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,809
some cool little stats up here so right

00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:10,019
now everything's good you can see the

00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:11,459
the most recent report now the one

00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,910
I really like is this is also through

00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:16,739
Sipan testers is stats dot Sipan testers

00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,470
org and this is like a live count of

00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:21,329
reports and number of distributions on

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,879
Sipan and there's all these cool graphs

00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:26,579
so if you're a nerd like me and you like

00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,139
you know stats then this is kind of a

00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,850
cool thing to check out so again another

00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,040
opportunity to contribute but I'm not

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,959
going to get too much into that because

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,569
more of a general contributing to see

00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:39,559
pan talk so what should I contribute to

00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:41,850
see pan file a bug that's pretty useful

00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:44,279
improved documentation on a module you

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,290
struggled to use especially if you got

00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,850
help from the author or if you had to

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,379
crack open the source code in order to

00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,299
figure out how to use it this is an

00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:53,249
excellent excellent opportunity to save

00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:54,959
other people time I can't count the

00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,299
number of times that I personally have

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,699
not contributed documentation when I

00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:01,199
should have and it probably would have

00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:02,999
saved so many other people headaches it

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,220
would have saved the authors time you

00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:07,350
know it's it's just it's really really

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,839
straightforward and a very easy very

00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,339
easy way to provide something back to

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,949
the community when you find something

00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,360
useful on Sipan another thing if you had

00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:17,990
to make local changes to make it work

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,459
for you absolutely submit the patch and

00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,689
you know it maybe it'll get rejected

00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,660
maybe it won't but i'll talk a little

00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:27,110
bit about that ok so that's awesome how

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:31,110
do I get started so before I continue

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:33,420
Sipan is the wild wild west it is a wild

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:36,449
frontier every module owner does things

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,799
their own way so do not trust that the

00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:39,869
stuff that i am going what i'm going to

00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,230
talk to you about in the process i'm

00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:44,459
going to suggest is merely an example

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,959
you know you absolutely want to check

00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:48,540
with the module maintainer and read

00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,619
their specific documentation before you

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,230
just assume that they're going to use

00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:53,399
the same process however for the record

00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,740
the process that I'm going to recommend

00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,319
is just a github based process a lot of

00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,449
module maintainer zar using that now so

00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:02,879
you should be good to go so how do i

00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:04,259
submit a patch to see pan well first you

00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,540
need to find the location of the source

00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:09,089
code repository this is where meta Sipan

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,949
is awesome so let me like flip over Oh

00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:12,149
into where the author wants patches

00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:13,889
submitted generally they're going to

00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:15,540
provide that information in the

00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:19,110
documentation but if they're using

00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:21,360
github then so this is this is a module

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,040
I created for my talk Oh something kind

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,610
of cool let me show you guys the the cpn

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,540
testers

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:29,279
table so here when you have a module up

00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,220
on Sipan there's a little link in

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,529
medicine so i can see all the places

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,779
where where i passed and failed through

00:15:34,529 --> 00:15:39,360
Sipan testers this is kind of a cool

00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:41,250
little of a cool little thing and all

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,420
the versions of pearl that that my

00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:47,459
little module worked on so this is why I

00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:50,220
met a seat pan is great check it out

00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:51,720
clone repository oh well that must be

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,220
really author wants things and unless

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,519
they say something different you know

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,649
generally um you know generally that's

00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,660
that should be sufficient if they have

00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:04,140
github so let me see I think I had an

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:06,149
example oh here we go so date time

00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,410
here's an example of one that's a little

00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:10,500
bit different so this one is a straight

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,420
git clone so he'll want you two to clone

00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,870
the get repository and probably submit a

00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:17,040
patch through RT so cpn also uses RT

00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:21,480
actually I'm going to talk about that a

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,880
second so um okay so let me get back on

00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:28,470
track here before I my brain turns into

00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:30,959
Sipan alright so yeah find the repo some

00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,130
modules I met a cpn have repository info

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,019
you'll want to check the module

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:36,120
documentation there's a really great

00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,589
utility called get cpn patch I'll show

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,269
you guys the page I'm not going to get

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:41,190
into how it works into a lot of detail

00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:43,800
but it's essentially if you have to

00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:47,850
download the tarball for some reason you

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,949
can you can basically you can use a git

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,589
repo locally and then submit patches

00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:54,510
directly to RT so you know so you're not

00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:56,880
having to you know force the author to

00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,980
use get if you know if that's not what

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,899
they want to use and it's it's a pretty

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,220
cool little suite of commands so if you

00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:05,370
are in a situation where you have to

00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,199
download a tarball because that's where

00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,790
the word is or you what for whatever

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,350
reason you can't get repo information

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,990
from the author then you should

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:15,390
absolutely check out get Sipan all right

00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,299
where was I download the source tarball

00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:20,130
last resort so where do you submit the

00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,750
patch well typically the author is going

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,329
to have information they will probably

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,980
have specified the bug tracker in the

00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:28,439
meta Sipan information if they're not

00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,330
using github but it could be github

00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,030
bitbucket sourceforge i mean all over

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,929
the place like i said it's the Wild West

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,169
otherwise if you can't find any

00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:39,730
information you

00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:41,230
RT so what is our tea RTC pan org say

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,999
you want to file a bug it's really easy

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:48,669
you would send an email to bug dash

00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:49,659
module name separated by dashes except

00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:51,730
that's actually wrong it should be a

00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:55,899
capital A and it those should be capital

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:57,700
a is not lower case I think anyways yeah

00:17:55,899 --> 00:18:01,299
so you could absolutely just send an

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:03,759
email and and add your patch if you were

00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:05,950
submitting a patch with your RT so use

00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,049
our T if the author says to or you can't

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,989
find any bug tracker info and again you

00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:13,509
can attach a patch to RT let me give you

00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,830
so i'm going to show you our tea so

00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,080
here's what the page looks like when you

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:19,269
come in and if you don't have an account

00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,489
but want to browse bugs you can use the

00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:23,139
public interface and they show here like

00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:25,059
one reporter bucks and it in via email

00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:27,070
there's a lot of great information some

00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:33,519
outdated module examples that should

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:36,100
probably be updated hey opportunity and

00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:39,519
then as a module maintainer what i see

00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:42,299
when you submit that bug um let me click

00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:46,749
on my little guy over here acne Auggie

00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:49,090
hey more tests bugs so I've got some

00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:50,440
people submitting bugs to my little test

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,539
module because the Pearl community is

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,830
very prolific and and sometimes I think

00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:55,830
bored but I see it is

00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,330
but but I see it as supportive and I

00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,100
appreciate it because now I have some

00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:06,040
great examples to show all of you you

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,440
know wonderful people so see yes that's

00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,000
what our team looks like anda and I

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,250
generally get an email letting me know

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,800
that I've got an RT so and also if you

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,940
submit something in github then then

00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,030
they'll get that as well but i'll i'll

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,860
talk about github right now so pull

00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,540
request is probably sufficient for

00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:25,240
submitting your patch optionally you can

00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:30,700
create an hour t ticket that's perfectly

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:32,680
fine a no problem there so all right so

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,900
github let me go ahead and show you guys

00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,580
how that would work now I assuming the

00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:43,290
most of your promo that's the wrong

00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:47,500
window too many desktops no such thing

00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:51,610
alright alright so here's my wonderful

00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:53,500
and acne Auggie so say you know so so

00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,450
this is my perspective and so because I

00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,970
own it obviously I can't do a pull

00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:04,270
request so i created an account that i

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:06,190
call Auggie troll and so Argy troll can

00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,140
do what's called a porpoise so the way

00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:11,470
you do that is you log into github you

00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:13,030
click the magic fork button and then out

00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,070
and then you'll fork and then now you

00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:17,980
have a repo that's that's tied to that

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:20,490
repo and voila you know so now I can

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,990
make my code changes so so I'm going to

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,820
to clone it on my machine which I've

00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:31,690
already cloned it so obviously it's

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:35,830
going to complain oh and then sorry oh

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:37,270
oh is it too small how do I that's a

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:42,480
good question I'm pretty new to this

00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:42,480
whole presentation thing ctrl shift +

00:20:45,790 --> 00:21:03,920
um what is it oh sorry yeah yeah so uh

00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:08,420
all right oky mimosa yeah so um anyways

00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:11,780
yeah so was i oh yes i seeded into my

00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:13,520
repo uh so um so this is now cloned and

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,560
I've got it locally so I'm gonna make my

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,290
code changes hack hack hack I'm gonna

00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,930
add a new method called say augeas I'm

00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:22,310
gonna add a unit test because I come to

00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,690
class prepared have already done this so

00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:27,800
i don't have to nervously type it in

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:30,560
front of you guys alright and then now

00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,930
i'm gonna go back to my terminal and and

00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,850
then i'm gonna run my tests to make sure

00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,580
that i didn't screw anything up and

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,590
everything is successful so now I would

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,120
do my oh my git commit which I've

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,240
already done and everything so I'll do

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:48,470
all my git commit or get add you know

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,610
and then I and then get commit which you

00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,740
know I've already done so i'm not gonna

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,240
get a redo it but after I've done to get

00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:57,170
commit and put a very useful commit

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,240
message then I'll do a git push to send

00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,860
it up and obviously I don't need to do

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,210
this because this has already been done

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,300
but that's in a nutshell how you would

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,580
you know how you would do a pull request

00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:10,460
on that side so once you've got it back

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:12,920
up on github let me get back to that

00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,460
window that is not that window alright

00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,690
so once you got it back up on github

00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,520
you're gonna press the magic pull

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:22,010
request button actually I wanted to go

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,500
over to my audio troll account multiple

00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:26,420
browsers God crazy alright so now I'm

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,310
gonna I'm gonna push the the magic pull

00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,190
request button and so here i'm gonna

00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:32,510
type hey i'm adding an RG is and i just

00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:36,020
want to add this new feature because

00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:37,370
your model is awesome and and then i'm

00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,960
going to submit the pull request and

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:43,010
then it'll show up in the list here and

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:47,180
so now as the the admin of that i will

00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:49,400
have a pull request hopefully my network

00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:52,130
is not dead ok so now I've got you know

00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,670
I've got a couple pull requests this is

00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:56,460
actually the good one

00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:58,650
yeah the other one was me making a

00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,850
mistake and so it's kind of cool like

00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,200
one of the cool things about being a

00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,360
maintainer and hosting your stuff on

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,160
github is if I like your request I can

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:15,960
just hit that button and it's pretty

00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:18,030
cool and now I've merged yay so now as

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,530
the maintainer I'm not you know gonna go

00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,180
through all this but so as the

00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,670
maintainer potentially did I have that

00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,200
open on the side don't know okay so as

00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,030
the maintainer I would then download

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,880
that and then I used oscilla so then i

00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:33,120
would i would download that new you know

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,980
I'd do a poll to my local repo you know

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,900
do whatever you know things I needed to

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,550
do package it up and then using de Silla

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,820
I would just you know probably run some

00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:43,920
tests and then do diesel release BAM and

00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:47,130
then there would be a new version of the

00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:50,640
module up on uncie pan and in a short

00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:51,570
amount of time so so be cool so that's

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,920
pretty so that's just kind of what

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,110
happens from the maintainer side but

00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,030
again all you really need to care about

00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,970
if you're interested in you know

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,990
patching a Sipan module again I kind of

00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,940
recommend if you can find something

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:05,160
that's on github it's really easy as you

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:08,450
you can see they're so so that's how you

00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:11,100
would go about doing that and github so

00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,720
this is kind of some useful stuff how do

00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,680
I write a patch that's likely to get

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,680
merged don't submit a large complex

00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,480
patch so don't submit like one commits

00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,820
where you've done whitespace fixes

00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,800
you've done unit tests you've done like

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,330
five different features and it's all you

00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,800
know in one big thing because that makes

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:31,650
it really difficult for the maintainer

00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,820
when they receive the patch you know

00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,320
what if they only want to keep part of

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,490
it or what if they like one thing but

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,260
you know they don't like something else

00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,370
or whatever it makes it really hard for

00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,140
them to deal with it and they're more

00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:42,360
likely to reject your patch so for each

00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,520
thing that you're doing make it its own

00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,290
commit make sure each commit has a clear

00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,210
commit message so that whoever the

00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,560
maintainer is they're probably busy they

00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,460
can look at it pretty quickly and know

00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,830
if it's something that they're

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,570
interested in also be consistent and

00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:56,100
stick to the author style I'm not going

00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,500
to get into the whole you know spaces

00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,950
versus tabs war but if you like spaces

00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:04,160
author like stabs use to have

00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:06,140
the author is probably not I mean again

00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,610
you know if you don't like it you know

00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,860
you can always work you know make your

00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:14,540
own like you know spaces version I don't

00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:17,150
know it's open source um update

00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,890
documentation when appropriate I that's

00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,570
always very useful like for instance if

00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,460
you add a new method like I did in the

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:25,100
case of mine i updated the pod with with

00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:27,350
the new method definition right tests to

00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,870
support your changes again you know

00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,730
really really important and finally if

00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,920
there is a change log for the module go

00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,230
ahead and update the change log with the

00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,660
changes that you've added so those are

00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:41,300
just some tips on and how to how to

00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,620
write a successful patch so again how do

00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,660
i submit my patch well you gotta

00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:48,020
download the source code make your

00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:49,160
changes and submit the code what happens

00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,050
when I submit a patch well if the author

00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,640
accepts your change they merge it in

00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,980
their repository and they release the

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,320
code if your change is rejected however

00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,940
and this does happen the author will

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,500
comment on the pull request or the RT

00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,930
ticket or they may contact you directly

00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,310
don't give up talk it out with the

00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,860
author if it's something that you feel

00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:08,030
pretty strongly about and you and you

00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,100
know and you feel like you can convince

00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,720
them great or you know use the feedback

00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,280
to fix your patch maybe it was just as

00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,960
simple as hey your commit message wasn't

00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,090
very helpful can you improve that that

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,190
definitely happened to me on I think my

00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:21,050
first lake pro/5 documentation patch it

00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,820
was just a simple documentation patch so

00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:25,160
I didn't think I needed to really say

00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,410
that much but it turns out you know it

00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,320
it was more helpful for everyone else if

00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:32,810
I did so you know I learned learn my

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,840
lesson how do I know my patch was

00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:38,270
submitted RT will respond to you with an

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,130
email if you don't get an email wait a

00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,140
couple of days and resubmit the system

00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:46,060
is generally pretty reliable but every

00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,060
now and then you know things happen

00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:51,470
github will show your pull request it

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,180
also notifies the author again if you

00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,920
don't hear anything and you put in a

00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,590
pull request go ahead and submit in our

00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,930
teaticket that'll ping the author okay

00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,790
so what happens if the author you do all

00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,560
this you you've like ping the author a

00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:05,870
bunch of times and it's you know you're

00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:09,170
just not getting ahold of them send an

00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:10,940
email to module at pearl org use this

00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:13,220
resource only after several attempts to

00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,560
contact the author state a log of how

00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,540
you

00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:18,210
tried to contact the author and if the

00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:23,670
author is unresponsive hey you could be

00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:26,550
the new maintainer welcome to see pan or

00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:28,440
finally like I said I if just thought

00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,480
you know you're just having very huge

00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,340
philosophical differences and authors

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,020
being very difficult to work with fork

00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,150
and that's another way that you now

00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:40,260
become the maintainer of your own you

00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:43,800
know your own module you know final

00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:46,320
final comments collaboration is fun it's

00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,120
fun to work on interesting things get so

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,190
you know others get really excited about

00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,350
your ideas you get excited about someone

00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,660
else's ideas it feels good to help other

00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:56,250
people out you learn new things I know

00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,270
typically most of our jobs we're kind of

00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,890
doing the same thing all the time

00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:00,390
working with the same codebase we get

00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,980
really comfortable so it's nice to

00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:04,230
branch out and kind of throw yourself

00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:07,650
into the deep water of some murky you

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:11,130
know Sipan module or p5 you know core

00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:13,080
issue and even people who aren't using

00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:17,190
Perl at work generally contribute to the

00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:18,420
pro community because it's fun so so

00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:20,960
that's the end of my talk if you guys

00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,960
have any questions

00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:38,540
yes this is the question so much of the

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,890
comment they also get an yes yes no go

00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,570
ahead actually you probably I mean I've

00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:44,540
mostly just use github I haven't used

00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:47,060
get pan very heavily so so in 2009

00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:48,980
fernet is crazy idea upload every single

00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:51,830
module that was on steep and to github

00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:54,050
and so there's an archive called get Han

00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:56,750
and it's actually github.com / get pan

00:28:54,050 --> 00:29:00,380
and it has basically everything that was

00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:02,750
on CPM 2009 so if nothing else it's

00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,310
certainly not github somewhere if it's

00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,160
officially old enough if it's a newer

00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:08,530
that it probably already does have

00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,510
resources because I know that a lot of

00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:13,400
module offers are really good speaking

00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,680
personally this is super important i

00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,270
wonder if if anyone sent me a patch for

00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,790
anything ever in town I'm super grateful

00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:23,210
no matter how it comes me email or

00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:26,840
request smoke signals care your pity

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:29,420
doesn't matter right so yeah it's I

00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,340
don't always like want to give a pact is

00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:36,200
the only thing better than I am I am

00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:39,040
exceedingly seriously grateful for so

00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:43,880
but get hanna's a resource to you oh

00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:50,800
great thank you Sawyer I want the common

00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:50,800
just Muslims abrasive

00:29:56,989 --> 00:30:01,499
yes if you found someone who would not

00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,609
phone call for a contribution than be

00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:08,849
heavy generally the u2 is unit module of

00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:12,210
Aegina grateful which over there will be

00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:13,979
but the users will always be great so

00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,539
one of the best things he said was like

00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:17,759
dr. noble things that you went through

00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:22,919
one of the most important things that

00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:24,599
abusers get other users yeah let's put

00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,330
this whole or is you say that's what

00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:29,039
this whole talk is about but to add to

00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:31,979
that as well you know when contributing

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,200
a pearl core as well I know pearl help

00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:36,690
and p5p are very welcoming and friendly

00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,549
environments but it is IRC so if you do

00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,259
have for some reason you me feel like

00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:41,759
you had a negative experience you know

00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:43,469
don't let that discourage you and if

00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,210
anything you know please please talk

00:30:43,469 --> 00:30:46,409
about it like whether you know if it's

00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,479
to an individual on the mailing list

00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:50,580
that you know or you can you can email

00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:52,619
me if you want and you know I'm more

00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,049
than happy to try to mediate you know

00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:56,700
whatever happened but it i mean you know

00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:58,589
overall they are very nice and very

00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,419
friendly places so I don't want anybody

00:30:58,589 --> 00:31:02,460
to feel you know feel like you can't go

00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:04,379
on those places and ask questions but

00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,809
certainly if you do for any reason have

00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:11,789
a bad experience it's it's an anomaly so

00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:18,149
we want to know about it yeah in the

00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:21,239
back you're here not being perfect or

00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:24,330
ever saw because it ever hears is there

00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:26,309
committing Berlin 30 miles energy when I

00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:29,929
spend all just as a game business degree

00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:29,929
and citizens

00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:44,850
some baseball come on back to go back

00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,789
just throw it out there oh my gosh a lot

00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:49,980
i don't think i can already just put it

00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:57,179
up there and like a week later for some

00:31:49,980 --> 00:32:01,760
keepers alive here's a patch so actually

00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:01,760
total volume and maybe the brazilian

00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,740
yeah so for those of you on the street I

00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,450
just you know it's just a reiteration of

00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,659
the don't be intimidated you know don't

00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:20,669
be afraid of perfection or don't don't

00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:22,049
focus on perfection you know everybody's

00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:23,519
human and it's better to put something

00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:28,340
out there and get the support from the

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,340
community than it is to think about it

00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:40,200
yes oh yes great um one very useful

00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:42,419
thing if you're just uses starting just

00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:50,789
document your weight do we were learning

00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:53,490
stuff cuz uh there's a good starting

00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:57,029
point after that it's all up in the air

00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:58,980
and just you know saying oh I read this

00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:02,580
file and I found this whether it's

00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:04,649
explanation that actually makes sense so

00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:09,210
send us up feedback or even want right

00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:10,799
and what about it and that yeah and

00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,840
that's actually why I like to point to

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,460
the Pearl hack document because I feel

00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,220
like just forgetting started with simple

00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,450
patches it's a lot more I find it be a

00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,010
lot more readable and helpful in the

00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:25,950
pearl two or pro hac too i think it is

00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:29,130
it wasn't even an instant recently where

00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:32,340
por el delta in which there was this new

00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:35,130
feature being explained and some guy

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:38,639
posted above saying well i've looked at

00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:41,190
you know the the release candidate and i

00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:43,529
didn't I don't know what this means so I

00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:46,260
I try to rephrase it any please check if

00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:49,289
this makes sense and the guy that wrote

00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:51,600
the original text said well thank you

00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:55,409
come to think of it your explanation is

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,169
much better than mine ah upon upon

00:33:55,409 --> 00:34:03,990
realization I just I couldn't figure out

00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:06,899
what I was it goes on that on and on you

00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:08,849
forever so it's a great thing to do yeah

00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:11,790
so again summation for the stream if you

00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:17,550
couldn't hear basically documentation

00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:20,190
patches a plus plus just a small it's

00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:23,490
ball one when sending patches to a girl

00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:27,030
or you don't get the mail back plug into

00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:29,399
P by being a PRC channel and just say

00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:31,859
hey I send the patch rating it reply

00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:33,750
back and someone there will check the

00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:38,510
more egg yolk you and see if it's there

00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,510
so distant ages so it doesn't get lost

00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:49,149
oh yes I was wondering is it is there

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:52,070
anywhere with your sort of like that

00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:53,600
it's a niche list or something like you

00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,889
know like sort of you know and looking

00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,260
for that small way and I think it would

00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:59,660
be cool to you know I you know obviously

00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,310
like there will be think that you're

00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,650
already looking at there but is there

00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,930
some small things that made for life

00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:08,960
father we can urge my lawn or something

00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:13,250
like that no patience with that luxury

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:16,100
for looks like it absolutely am I in

00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,630
that might be a good thing for ya so so

00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,270
so the question was like are people

00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,950
making wish lists on their modules

00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:24,530
looking for contributions and I know

00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:26,240
some some people do some people don't

00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,160
but I think that's a great suggestion to

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,430
module maintain errs if you do want

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,630
people to to contribute and you have

00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:35,710
particular areas that you would like

00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:41,570
them to contribute in absolutely like Oh

00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:43,190
a centralized wishes great I mean the

00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:56,290
only the only thing I can think it would

00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:56,290
be like Artie at Sipan org and basically

00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:03,490
i prioritize would think i'm creating

00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:07,300
one that i needed fixing that what is it

00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:10,050
play Pearl perfectly willing to find in

00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:13,330
your mind what goes in sight it's all

00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:23,080
I'm gonna do it I'm not going to look

00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:29,370
for it live then I you know like goals

00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:29,370
and milestones and there's also which

00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:55,480
quest at net Oh quest hub dad I oh all

00:36:45,940 --> 00:37:01,390
right whoo uh uh oh it's little Raptor

00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:03,070
arrays I'm sorry somebody was was

00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:11,650
sharing something and then we got

00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:13,570
distracted yes yeah that's the other

00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,510
thing i think i mentioned is that Sipan

00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:19,090
modules some of them do have I RC

00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:20,290
channels associated with them and if not

00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:22,180
you know you can't always go to pound

00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,050
pearl help and ask there and somebody

00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,450
will probably point you in the right

00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:27,780
direction yeah I was just going to say

00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:30,850
it one of the module 17 is a robot and

00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,020
why I don't submit feature questionable

00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:34,870
luck because I just need more work for

00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:37,270
me other people do so there's a class of

00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:39,400
ticket in RT called wish list hmm and a

00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:41,119
lot of stuff has wishlist tickets on

00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,160
them so you

00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,980
really want to like win brownie points

00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:49,519
but I would happily accept wishlist

00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:52,160
contributions for prologue especially if

00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:54,529
they're of the unit test variety that's

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,900
one of my wish list items but um but

00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:58,700
yeah so there's all kinds of tickets

00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,519
that are out there that are severity

00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:03,259
wish list that are beyond modules that

00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,119
you use all the time that someone

00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:07,119
follows a good idea once upon a time and

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,549
you can see some of them are quite old

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:15,140
so you know there's other unfulfilled

00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:19,039
wishes which is all very sad yeah I've

00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:20,569
got one of the top and digital and I

00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:22,849
just to note about our cheat at Sipan

00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:24,499
org all you need to do is for yourself

00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:26,720
but create a bit card account so anybody

00:38:24,499 --> 00:38:29,269
can or use an open ID to login so

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,190
anybody can create a login and again you

00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:33,440
can you can browse tickets anonymously

00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:35,960
to but there's no restriction on joining

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,759
RT so again for the stream if you guys

00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,309
couldn't hear we're talking about how do

00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:42,140
we get wish lists and so quest hub I 0

00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:47,119
is 1 and then also there's a wish list

00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:52,309
severity in RT that are also really

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:57,049
useful yes ok and some people tag and

00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:59,839
github with a wish list great there's an
