it's time um I have a I've edited these

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,980
slides a lot because I haven't really

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,559
been sure exactly all the things I

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,530
wanted to say or in what order so it's

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,910
it's probably a mess but I think it'll

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,789
be all right so I'm gonna be talking

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:23,449
about pro 5 has anyone here ever used

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:26,039
pro/5 his has anyone here ever

00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:28,949
contributed a patch to the pro five core

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,910
distribution that's a bunch baisakhi

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,829
buddy here subscribe to Perl 5 Porter's

00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:38,040
wow that's even more has anybody here

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:47,760
read all the messages they got on any

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:49,800
given day of pro 5 quarters wow wow well

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,350
good that's that's great um I'm going to

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,280
talk a little bit about pro/5 porters

00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,250
but I don't talk about a bunch of stuff

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,739
going on in Perl 5 and I'm hoping that i

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,570
am going to have time to take a lot of

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,010
questions if you have a lot of questions

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,239
but we're going to find out as I go and

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,510
if stuff gets boring i'm just going to

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:10,610
stop and say I want questions so if you

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:15,960
don't know what I do I am the pumpkin

00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:17,970
what that means is that I I'm look the

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,830
project manager for Pearl I make

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,560
decisions if the decisions are not

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,290
obvious or if they're only obvious to me

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,560
I poke people to make sure releases get

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,820
made and I get to stand up here and give

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,560
a talk where I talk about my feelings

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,680
when everybody else has to talk about

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,670
software that's complicated well I'm

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,780
going to talk about complicated software

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,049
though because i'm talking about pearl

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,920
in the past Pearl has been like a big

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:47,790
mess but these days pearl is a it's a

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,130
big mess um but we love our pearl right

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,799
it's it's a mess but it's it's our mess

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,619
and I promise we are not going to change

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,259
that we're going to leave it a nice big

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,390
mess so don't worry I'm going to talk a

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,219
little bit today about mess management

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,049
which was a slide here but now it's gone

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,869
I hope I'm not going to suffer from the

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:10,110
Steven little problem with keynote

00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:11,700
because I need my transitions um I'm

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,920
gonna talk about what's new and why we

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,810
put stuff in

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,510
where we're going and where we won't be

00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,550
going and why we won't be going there so

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,800
the first thing of substance I want to

00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,190
talk about is a little micro talk in

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:29,810
this style of talks that get in the past

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:33,350
pearl 518 who cares how many people here

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:35,300
have installed / 05 18 almost everybody

00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,700
that's awesome how many people are using

00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,610
it as like they're there the personal

00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:45,920
computers pearl who's is in Pro 518 for

00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:49,220
work a couple people great anybody's in

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,870
Pro 519 for their personal computer i'm

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,530
using 519 on my computer gives a three

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:58,130
or four people anybody's in 519 for work

00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:00,680
thank God um okay and if you upgrade it

00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:05,930
to pro 518 how many of you read the

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:08,239
Pearl Delta all of it yeah um that's

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,950
because the pro Delta is full of all

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,530
these really important bug fixes like

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,720
this guy right renaming packages through

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,540
glob assignment in combination with the

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,600
em ? matching operator and reset no

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:25,880
longer makes threaded builds crash yeah

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:27,799
the the uproar of joy um right or this

00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:31,609
this this is not my favorite weirdo bug

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:34,670
this one is if you have tied percent hat

00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:36,620
h and then it goes on to say like some

00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,530
instead of something horrible happened

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,600
something terrible happens um if you

00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,150
know what this hash is and you see the

00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,090
word tie to put with it if you didn't

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:50,500
weep a little bit if you didn't weep a

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,500
little bit you were probably Matt trout

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,800
so I'm going to talk about stuff that

00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,450
you might actually care about first

00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,560
thing I thought regex character class

00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:01,270
sets yeah they're great regex have

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,520
character sets right like this god I

00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,770
want to see if this has a thing from A

00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,320
to Z in it but you can't really do set

00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,720
operations with them except for addition

00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,330
right additions really easy like you can

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,280
say I want to match a to z well I want

00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,919
to add the zero to nine set great that's

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,510
easy but what if you want a through z 0

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:25,450
through 9 but not 3 3 is right out right

00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:28,300
you throw in a simple negative look

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,740
behind assertion I mean it's a simple

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,880
negative look behind assertion but once

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,370
you're using a negative look behind

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:38,290
desertion you're going downhill fast so

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,050
something you can say with a new it let

00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,840
me go back something you can say now is

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,669
I'm going to use an extended class right

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,520
that's what this little ? when you see a

00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:50,380
question mark after a parenthesis in

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,970
Perl regular expressions somebody is

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,930
getting clever but this is good clever

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,890
because it's really clear clever I want

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,960
let me go back a little more and tell

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:02,890
you something here we're gonna pretend

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:06,460
that you need this but you need to be

00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:09,970
unico d you need to pretend that Texas

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:13,690
is not the only country in the world so

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:16,380
you want all letters plus all numbers-

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,580
anything with a numeric value of three

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,280
right this is going to match all the

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,250
letters all the numbers except for Latin

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,720
digit 3 molly ollie digit 3 and you know

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,710
all these these crazy characters that

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:34,229
people warned you about when you use

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:34,229
backslash d and by the way no Cyrillic

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,980
this this this looks more complicated at

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,060
first you see more squiggly bits except

00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,979
you can look at it and it's totally

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,800
clear it's totally clear what you've

00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:47,180
done and if you have ever needed to do

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,970
this kind of regular expression which I

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,729
admit is a little bit out there you are

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,110
really happy right now the only thing to

00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:56,960
note is that you'd actually have to

00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,490
start this off by saying no warnings

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,250
experimental regex sets because right

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,720
now we're still testing the waters so

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,240
it's going to warn you hey you're using

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,740
an experimental feature um think twice

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,850
you know just make sure you're cool with

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,820
that because we might change it next

00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,620
time we'll come back to this let's cool

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,880
subroutines are really neat and these

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,139
are one of these features it happens all

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,389
the time and I put a talk together like

00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:19,580
this where lexical subroutines are a

00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:20,930
feature that I think is pretty neat but

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,940
I don't know what I'd use it for why I

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,410
care and I want to show everybody why

00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,490
it's cool i have to write an example and

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,889
i'm writing these examples and it's

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,479
super super contrived this example is

00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,830
looking 5 don't worry but it's really

00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:33,289
contrived and it's not does it look

00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,270
useful um but then as I've been doing it

00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:37,340
I realized why it's useful and then I'm

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,979
super excited and I'm super excited by

00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,169
this so we're going to use a lexical

00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:44,360
subroutine first we make a normal

00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:46,580
subroutine called some as you may guess

00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,990
this is going to add two numbers so we

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:53,900
get the first number and then whoa yes

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:57,139
we're making a lexical subroutine it has

00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:00,410
the same scope as any other lexical

00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:04,520
right it's only visible inside of this

00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:07,510
block and we're going to take a another

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,280
argument we're going to add it to X and

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:14,270
then we're going to call that lexical

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,500
subroutine with our arguments yeah with

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,099
the argument that is left on the stack

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,410
as you all of you having read

00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:23,870
higher-order pearl right you all know

00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:27,530
this is a closure and that lexical

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:30,500
subroutine has closed over the X so

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:33,410
let's get we're on the same page what's

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:42,080
this going to return three how about

00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:44,479
this five and the next 17 and the reason

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,200
that it's that it's 5 and not for is

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,700
that that lexical gets rebuilt ever

00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,410
time you call it it's just like a normal

00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,430
lexical right it goes away at the end of

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:57,560
scope it's garbage collected basically

00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,030
so everybody get this right this is kind

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,550
of cool I mean this is my super

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:04,100
contrived example this is to show you

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,140
the basics something else you can do if

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,880
you're if you like me are still running

00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,640
a lot of 58 you may have forgotten about

00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:14,450
a feature we added six years ago you can

00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:17,140
say this so now you build a subroutine

00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:19,370
once and it sticks around there so

00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:22,460
that's that's good that shouldn't have a

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:29,900
uh wha but Ori what's that what's the

00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:31,280
next 14 why is it for yes because now

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,500
we've closed over the ex the first time

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,000
and we don't rebuild that sub this is

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,430
useful if you want to build up a call

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,950
back only if you need it but then never

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:43,160
build it up again but you could be using

00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,810
state dollar sub equals sub write an

00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,370
anonymous one this one lets you call

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:50,240
things by name so your code doesn't have

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,620
all these dollar foo arab / ends so the

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,170
question is why do I really want to use

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,880
this because in five I don't know 50

00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,340
something you could have already built

00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,750
normal closures and call them and it's a

00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,740
little goofy to look at but it's pearl

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:05,960
right everything's a little goofy to

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:10,790
look at worry I got a I got a non

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:12,590
contrived example next um so I'm gonna

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:16,550
write I'm gonna write this i'm writing a

00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:18,620
test file who writes tests yay okay on

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,180
the right a test file and in my test

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,800
file i write some routine that prints

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,660
out diagnostics based on I don't know

00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,320
stuff right and I'm going to use this

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,210
all over my program but because I like

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,480
factoring stuff into tiny little pieces

00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,770
so no one else knows how to work on it

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,350
I'm going to put all the parts of my

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,670
it's really true I'm going to put I'm

00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,140
going to put all the parts of my test

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:43,130
into their sub packages by the way

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:47,630
packagename block is my second favorite

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:48,710
feature from 514 I love it so we're

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,970
going to have some subroutine in there

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,290
that's going to like do some work when

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,360
you say test stuff and then it's going

00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,400
to do a diagnostic and we're going to

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,720
have another one or that helper is going

00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,100
to do some stuff and then it's going to

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,400
do a diagnostic but what's the problem

00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,400
here

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:08,480
sorry it won't find diag because diag

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:11,200
was defined up in Maine and these guys

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,320
are calling it from these things but

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,630
that's lexical lexical scope trend sends

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,340
the boundaries of packages you can find

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,410
that everywhere right so this is pretty

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:32,450
sweet for test there's only one little

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:36,560
problem which is uh which is this whoops

00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:38,210
um what we'll fix that eventually but

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,860
but this is where I cool right you don't

00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,180
need to use lexical subroutine for this

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,280
because there's no reason it has to be

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,410
private or go away what you wanted was

00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,860
the ability to transcend package values

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,150
package boundaries with a lexical name

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:57,290
how do you get a lexical name on a

00:10:50,150 --> 00:11:00,080
package variable our our sub now this is

00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:02,360
a totally normal package subroutine with

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,260
a lexically available name in all lower

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,480
scopes awesome I'm going to start using

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,350
that like as soon as it doesn't seg

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,620
fault um it it works it does work as

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,150
long as you're not D tracing um so you

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,560
know I haven't really learned dtrace so

00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:23,720
I'm probably start using it right now um

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:26,630
I don't know why I have this slide again

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:31,340
oh because you can't write this you have

00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:38,390
to write this and if you do that you

00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:41,710
will still have to do this yeah you have

00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:44,000
to do it twice let's not get into it oh

00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:47,930
okay well should say nor expand MX

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,000
bessemer Sarah okay um it should say

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:54,590
lexical subs twice and not regex sets um

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,940
this feature is still clearly under

00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,800
development because it does stuff like

00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,740
said fault and show unknown in your

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,780
stack traces and other really cool stuff

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,000
if you want to find cool bugs find bugs

00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:10,210
in this and then fix them I will give

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,900
you a nickel for each one um not you um

00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,379
experimental features right so why are

00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:17,290
these things experimental features

00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:19,579
we've made experimental features because

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,399
if you've got your laptop in front of

00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:25,189
you run pearl especially for on 518 it's

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,110
better run pearl doc pearl experiment

00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:29,629
and it tells you all the features that

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:33,230
are experimental in pearl things like

00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:36,470
weak references and I threads and

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,540
attributes like stuff that are used all

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,279
over the place and how do you know it's

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,959
experimental well until this last

00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,009
released you basically didn't or you

00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:44,540
like went and you did a bunch of

00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:46,699
research and you found this out so

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,230
people would use these features and if

00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,459
it's experimental doesn't that mean that

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,769
we're not sure if it's good we might

00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:53,629
change what my rip it out yeah but we

00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:56,000
can't take out attributes who here uses

00:12:53,629 --> 00:13:00,279
catalyst yeah how would you like it of

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,550
all your code broke no right so I said

00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:05,930
it would be worth well so um so we want

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,160
to we want to make it clear these things

00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,959
are experimental we still want

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,730
experiments experiments are awesome but

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,110
we want to let you know okay like here

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,449
there are dragons and if you like

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,889
dragons that's cool but like they might

00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:18,170
change later and start breathing

00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:19,399
something you weren't expecting and you

00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,389
need to acknowledge that by saying no

00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,589
warning so we've got some other

00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:26,149
experimental features going on like

00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:33,019
lexical topic so lexical topic is right

00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:36,290
so oops okay here's the subroutine of

00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:38,660
the four statements after pulling in the

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,370
topic which of those statements can

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:48,040
refer to the contents of dollar

00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:53,839
underscore all of them how about here

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:56,059
three of them okay um so the answer is

00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:00,319
it depends on how resets to that was

00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:02,839
defined if you wrote this then it's

00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:06,439
three of them right you can't see it

00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:08,389
resets it out if you wrote this then you

00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:10,819
can see the content of your collars

00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:13,970
dollar underscore but only in dollar

00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:17,300
underscore brackets 0 becomes an

00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,980
argument ok so let you got to learn

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,240
something alerting some things okay I

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:27,199
like learning something every couple

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,860
months but seek write write this in both

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,680
cases

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,209
in these dollar underscore depends on

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,680
the environment where it was where it

00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:38,630
was declared and in the second case the

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:42,200
topic that was in force when it was

00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:44,990
called goes into the stack don't worry

00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,769
about it the reason that this is problem

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:51,890
beyond the fact that it's weird who uses

00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:54,110
try tiny yes wow that's actually really

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:58,550
good I didn't expect that try tiny is

00:14:54,110 --> 00:15:00,440
really nice um you can do a try and this

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,269
is just a subroutine it that you can

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,519
leave out the words sub but those two

00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:07,310
squiggly braces those are enclosing

00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:09,260
subroutines and if the first thing dies

00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:12,019
which it very well might given this code

00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,899
on then the second sub routine is called

00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:16,970
with the exception in the topic so

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:18,380
what's going to happen here um is it

00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:24,440
going to die is this code really gonna

00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:27,550
die well no because that's the end of

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,800
file but thank you for playing um right

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,120
the trot the try block will die it will

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,000
go into the catch block the catch block

00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,440
will match ignore against that and it

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,990
won't die it successfully caught the

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,490
exception until somebody seven thousand

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:44,959
lines higher in this program adds this

00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:47,589
guy because now that second subroutine

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:51,260
is a closure over the lexical topic

00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:57,350
awesome so you have to write it like

00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:59,360
this right no no one wants to write this

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,529
that's okay there's another way if this

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,970
doesn't look good you don't like having

00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:03,769
to put you see the prototype I put in if

00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:08,209
you don't have to put in sub in a

00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:10,100
prototype you could write this right so

00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:11,420
we're not sure like the lexical topic it

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,870
seemed like a really good idea if his

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,640
lexical stuff is good but pro/5 has a

00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,680
lot of expectations of certain Global's

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,000
including the topic and we've subvert of

00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,060
those expectations and made people

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,420
really really unhappy by doing it

00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:29,570
speaking of making people unhappy um no

00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:32,720
I don't want to talk about it um smart

00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:34,130
match has been a big point of contention

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,890
and I don't want to say anything more

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,120
about it than that in general everyone

00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,380
is happy with some part of some are

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,089
match and nobody's happy with the whole

00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,779
thing so what we've done is we've said

00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:44,180
we know it

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:45,740
to change somehow and the change needs

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,199
to get done maybe it's maybe it's fixing

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,149
stuff probably to work like this

00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:52,699
memorize this the slide won't be up long

00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:54,170
and maybe it's to rip the feature out

00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:55,730
we're not sure but now it's experimental

00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,550
if you use these features you get a

00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:01,339
warning who has encountered this got

00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,019
very few people okay um who has been

00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:06,650
unable to install something because of

00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:08,360
no warnings tests yeah okay same people

00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,179
in fact I think that's exactly the same

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,650
people but we need these things we need

00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:13,789
to be able to mark our experiments as

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,230
these are things that we don't know

00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:16,610
what's going to happen please be careful

00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,959
because we don't want to get stuck in

00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,400
this we have to be backwards compatible

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:22,069
to people who've been using this feature

00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,780
since 1997 when it was introduced as an

00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:25,850
experiment with a comment please don't

00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,770
ever use this you know that comment was

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,470
in a pearl delta and when i install / 05

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,510
16 i don't go and read pro 5006 delta or

00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:38,900
5005 delta or wherever these things come

00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:40,669
in this is especially bad I this slide

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:44,900
is out of place so we're gonna skip it

00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:47,299
but nice ellipses right um how did this

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:50,090
slide get over here right so the point

00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:53,000
here was if you were if you were putting

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,950
a try-catch inside your given when it's

00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,200
implicitly lexicalized or topic and your

00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:00,140
caches is a closure again that's all

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:05,450
isn't that great okay more stuff hash

00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:08,960
randomization everybody knows that this

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:12,140
program is going to print out the same

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,250
stuff over and over right because hashes

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,600
go in the same order if they've got the

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,539
same stuff some people make this

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:20,510
argument but it's it's not really ever

00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:22,730
been true we're really lucky for this

00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,770
example that these things happen to come

00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,600
at this way in fact in pro 516 and

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,940
earlier they very often will come out

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:31,190
this way but if you pick slightly

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:35,409
different values this is pro 5 16 or 5

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:37,669
14 I'm running here stuff is different

00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:43,159
what when do you encounter these

00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:45,830
differences really really rarely um not

00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,330
not like never but it'll happen once in

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,590
a while and when does it happen well it

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:52,789
happens based on what keys are in your

00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:53,799
hash so like sometimes your hash will

00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:55,869
come out in different order

00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,889
and you will search for this bug and you

00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:58,119
will searched and searched and searched

00:18:56,889 --> 00:19:03,730
and you will never find it because you

00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:05,950
won't have the same user input so the

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:08,950
key to understand here this is the

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:11,799
promise we make infer ills this is the

00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:14,460
promise we keep the stuff you get out of

00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:17,830
keys and values and the order of each

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,840
goes in the same order from a single

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,299
hash variable every time unless you

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,629
change it the reason I'm telling you

00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:28,690
what we've always done is that in 518

00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:30,159
it's going to change all the time like

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,269
you do anything with any kind of hashes

00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:33,759
that are a little different you touch

00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:35,049
them they just change like crazy this is

00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,489
really good because that bug that you

00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,350
spent like three weeks debugging and

00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:39,549
never found the answer to you're gonna

00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,629
find that bug every time you run your

00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:45,549
program because it's different every

00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:48,480
time who uses this feature yes no 1 i'm

00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:51,159
sorry Damien couldn't be here this year

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,320
these are really really crazy ways of

00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:56,739
embedding Perl code inside your regular

00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:00,940
expressions they're very cool they work

00:19:56,739 --> 00:20:03,789
now um they didn't they if you like had

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:07,149
a string that had a brace in at your

00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:11,739
pearl with segfault it was sweet we sent

00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:16,299
felt pearl differently now split this is

00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:18,549
for all the awk fans if you have done

00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:22,149
this in the past you split with a

00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:24,340
literal string it acts like awk if you

00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:27,309
split with a scalar containing a literal

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:30,669
string it splits like pearl who thinks

00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:36,460
this is awesome some people yeah well

00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:38,230
get Ben it's it's been fixed um it's

00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,470
fixed by they both work like the top one

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:44,289
if the first argument if the first

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:48,309
argument to split evaluates to a single

00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:50,320
space character it works like awk the

00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:51,850
ways in which it was broken subtly

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,230
before are awesome but I don't have time

00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,049
if you ask me later I'll trying to show

00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:58,029
you some cool examples ok stuff is

00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:59,950
leaving I i we had our fond farewell to

00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:01,659
CGI p.m. which which parent I really

00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,510
appreciate it i thought that is that cgi

00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:05,010
p.m. is also for me was really important

00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,430
and we are getting rid of some other

00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:15,180
stuff of differing amounts of importance

00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:18,300
to me leaving the core these guys they

00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:21,060
have all been marked as going soon and

00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:23,460
in Perl 5 19 they are gone from the core

00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,230
they are still on Sipan totally still

00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,120
installing you can use them I have no

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:30,900
I've nothing to say about the quality of

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,480
these you know it's not my job I don't

00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,640
think that they're all bad modules but

00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,080
they are leaving the core because we are

00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,630
trying to get the maintenance burden on

00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,910
the core really low ok that's everything

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:45,440
I think I have to say about 518 I have

00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:55,470
25 minutes that's not bad any questions

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:57,720
yes roget's grant who knows about regex

00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,460
grammars a lot of people that's good

00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,190
regex grammars is a really really cool

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:05,120
module um and I'm going to grossly

00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:07,650
oversimplified what it lets you do is

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,140
write something that looks a lot like a

00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,540
Perl 6 grammar at least compared to a

00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,190
regular expression and it turns into a

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,840
regular expression which you can then

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,990
use like a grammar and pearl really

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,650
really cool and it was broken by that

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:23,910
work on the embedded pearl in regex and

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,350
originally it was broken irrevocably

00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:28,110
there were some really nasty little bug

00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:30,960
stuck in there and it is now reveka

00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:34,920
bleah broken um but someone needs to

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,810
revoke it needs to be fixed um and if

00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,590
anyone would like to send Damien a patch

00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:42,420
um I'm sure Damien would be happy to

00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,640
receive it he will throw you across the

00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:48,540
room I don't know how Damien shows us

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,640
thanks but yeah it seriously if somebody

00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,600
here uses it and once to fix under 25 18

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,040
that would be that would be super

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,530
they're not a lot of modules that are

00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,670
really broken under 5 18 some of them

00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,200
have their test Suites fail for

00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,700
uninteresting reasons but but red X

00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,960
grammar is a cool module that is broken

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:09,380
under 5 18 because of serious bug fixing

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,380
anybody else about 5 18 you're welcome

00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:17,780
Thanks alright alright it's always nice

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,540
to hear but um actually do very little

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,520
um which is also really nice and I may

00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,050
talk about that a little bit the amount

00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,400
of work i have to do is pretty low which

00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,710
is which is nice we've gotten into a

00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,700
good rhythm of getting these things out

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,040
which is the only reason i would be

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,360
standing here if i had to do the kind of

00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,880
stuff that pumpkins in the past have

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,710
done i would still be eating tacos right

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,200
now and not talking about what I've been

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,930
doing here ok so I'm going to talk about

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:47,390
pro/5 in general I think we established

00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:50,120
many people here have used pro 5 and who

00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:52,340
here has heard talk about pro/5 being

00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,710
stuck or stagnant or blocked or anything

00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,600
like this right so who has heard that we

00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,130
need to like rebrand pearl five and

00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,360
change what it is right so we've been

00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,030
talking a lot about how are we going to

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,530
rebrand new logos new names this has

00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:11,240
been suggested by a lot of people the

00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:12,710
new pro 5 uh some people have suggested

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,120
that you know what we want is really

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,380
just it's you know there are people who

00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,940
establish this pattern already we have

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,440
something good we want to make some

00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,800
small modifications and offer a new

00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,800
product

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,520
I like this one because really um I

00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,650
think that what we want to do uh to make

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:34,660
things go smoothly is to have a lot of

00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:37,210
pearl fives um Liz gave a talk I think

00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:42,240
yesterday about all the different pearls

00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:44,530
we have languages that claim to be pearl

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,940
like profile I'm not saying they're

00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,470
there they're applying and saying

00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,740
they're pearl no / like pro 5 it says

00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:54,520
I'm a pearl um no I think says it's a

00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:57,820
pearl right yeah sure Thank you Thank

00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:02,800
You someone and in other what p2 is a

00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:06,520
pearl ruby is maybe a pearl um or at one

00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,080
point might have said that but what we

00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,250
don't have people talking about much are

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,720
other pearl fives or if they do I think

00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,070
they're using the term in a very loose

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,690
sense so another proposal that's been

00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,880
made is talking about pumpkin pumpkin

00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,980
pearl and the point here is there are

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,170
many pearl fives I mean there aren't

00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:26,350
right there's one this one pro 5 but but

00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:28,690
but there's many profiles and ours is

00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:30,220
pump control this is this has been said

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,620
there's something I really like about

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:35,010
this proposal and it's not just look on

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:37,420
his pumpkins face which is just adorable

00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:38,770
it's that if we have pumpkin pearl and

00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:41,230
it's like yeah we have pro/5 it's

00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,730
pumpkin pro that's the 1i run we can

00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,930
start with that and somebody else can

00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:46,030
say I want to make some changes I want

00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:48,880
to do some crazy stuff but I'm not going

00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:51,640
to write my own pearl from scratch the

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,190
people who are doing this like cool I'm

00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,990
i hope everybody learned something

00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:58,960
awesome i hope these things go somewhere

00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:02,200
and produce value for Humanity I could

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,810
not possibly think of enduring the

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,890
suffering of saying I'm going to

00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:09,100
implement a new language and it's going

00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,690
to be a pearl like holy cow no I'm going

00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,440
to start like I'm going to start with

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,690
this guy and I'm going to make some

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,060
changes i'm gonna make hubbard right and

00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,410
it's some other pearl that's weird in

00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:20,800
some other ways it's good for things

00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:22,750
other than just pie because pro pie is

00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,800
great and somebody else can say well i'm

00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,140
going to make different changes because

00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,420
i want to break pearl two I want to do

00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:31,450
things in pearl that if I shift in a

00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,440
stable pearl release the system into the

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,750
world would come and have my

00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,170
so I'm going to release my other fork

00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:40,660
and my favor and i will donate something

00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:42,750
to anybody who starts and deliver

00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:46,140
something significant and a pearl called

00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:48,580
turban this is a this is a turban squash

00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,800
um I don't just love because of the name

00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,600
I love I like it because of the name um

00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,730
but having something like turbines

00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,200
turban pearl is like having an

00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,060
experimental feature it's a way of

00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,800
saying we're doing something weird over

00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,850
here um and maybe you're going to say

00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,440
we're doing something weird but we're

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:06,790
sticking to it it's not going to change

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:11,320
but from the perspective of me using the

00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:13,140
pearl or pearl um it's saying we're

00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,130
we're going to really change stuff and

00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,650
you have to you have to read our whole

00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,790
Delta because our Delta is going to tell

00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:21,010
you things that are going to break some

00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,840
amount of code you start with pearl and

00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:24,280
then you break it and then you see how

00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,790
much you broke and how much you win

00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:30,700
alright like we broke 400 Sipan modules

00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,930
or 3000 cpn modules or or however you

00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,170
want to measure what you broke and you

00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:36,970
see but it's way better because

00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:38,560
something alright like it's faster or

00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,330
you can do something really cool

00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,280
packages or you can get a much better

00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,530
metal object system built into it

00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,300
whatever and then if it turns out that

00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,750
the breakage is pretty small and the win

00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:53,770
is huge I can steal your work and we can

00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:56,050
we can bring it back into pearl 5 which

00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:58,330
is great so when people want to talk

00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:03,910
about what is the future of pearl 5 the

00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:05,110
future of pro 5 is pro 5 um it's not

00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,850
going to go anywhere we're not going to

00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:09,340
we're not going to break pearl it's

00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:12,550
going to stay pearl so what what is

00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,840
pearl um pearls should get more pearl

00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,970
ash that's how pearls should be changing

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,330
I think what does that mean right well

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:21,220
pearl pearl is a beta it's a hole that

00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:25,870
is made of parts that all work really

00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:28,000
nicely together um the things that I

00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:30,490
think make it pearl are that pearl is

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,790
teachable I think pearl is actually very

00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:35,560
easy to teach it's guessable if you know

00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,360
if you're an existing pearl programmer

00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,620
and you want to figure out how something

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,210
is look gonna work that you're looking

00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,790
at you can guess and you're pretty often

00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:45,520
write fifty percent and maybe better I

00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,880
think but but sure fifty percent is not

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,310
bad

00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,690
um it's extensible right if you're

00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,850
frustrated with the limits of pearl you

00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:54,580
can you can do more with it and it's

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,900
compatible it's compatible for someone

00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,430
who wants to upgrade they can upgrade

00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:02,500
with confidence that everything is not

00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:06,700
going to go nuts and then um yeah i did

00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:11,140
it i mentioned back compat right oh snap

00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:12,850
back up at this is where people start to

00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,770
like grit their teeth because why do we

00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,000
have to be backwards compatible

00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:17,560
backwards compatible is like the worst

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,190
thing ever backwards compatibility is

00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,780
holding us bad and we should break

00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:25,780
horrible old features to allow evolution

00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,010
or we don't make change because we need

00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:31,300
back compat and this is really really

00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:33,130
bad the the the maxim that I've come to

00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,890
accept the more I work on pearl and

00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:38,110
other projects is that success hates

00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:40,840
agility right these two things are

00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:43,720
opposites if your project is really

00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,700
successful and has a lot of users the

00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,070
more you change it the more users you

00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,800
will lose because they can't keep using

00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,090
your product they can't upgrade and if

00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,530
their choices well I can upgrade in

00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,540
everything breaks or I can stay on the

00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:56,680
version I've got they'll stand the

00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,960
version they've got you know like

00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,520
lexical subroutines are cool but I'm not

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,780
going to break my business to get

00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,230
lexical subroutines I'm not going to

00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:07,570
break all that code there and everybody

00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:09,250
knows that we need to break some things

00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,300
right like that's how you fix bugs well

00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,860
like a bug something's going to call

00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:15,130
that a feature you have to fix it or not

00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:17,230
I don't know but this is the good famous

00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:19,210
Larry wall quote we all agree on the

00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,700
necessity of compromise we just can't

00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:24,060
agree when it's necessary to compromise

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:26,560
which can also be formulated like this

00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:30,430
we all agree we should remove cruft we

00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,140
can't agree on what cruft to remove what

00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:35,020
are we going to take out a pearl are we

00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:36,970
going to take out prototypes and break

00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:40,210
everything are we going to take out ties

00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:41,440
and break everything or like or we gotta

00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:44,890
take out something smaller are we going

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,870
to take out on the implicit latin1 ISM

00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:48,220
of strings under certain operating

00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:51,130
conditions in break I don't know how

00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,230
much right people all wanted things to

00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,310
change but the question of what they

00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,780
want the change and how much they're

00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:59,680
willing to break is very very different

00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:00,970
and I I've have established an ID

00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,520
of how much we can break and what we're

00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:05,920
going to change in the pearl that I'm

00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,750
managing and once we have turban pearl

00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,360
people can make different decisions and

00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:14,020
we can see how that goes and the nice

00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:16,390
thing I think will be to see what in

00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:19,120
what direction they evolve and the

00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:21,610
coolest thing is that if somebody Forks

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,800
pearl and starts making a few small

00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,970
changes that break some amount of stuff

00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,640
and have some amount of benefit and

00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:29,760
everyone wants to use that one then that

00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,900
can be the pearl that everybody uses

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,630
fork and github taught us that's right

00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,250
forking is awesome we fork each other's

00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,660
code we play with it we see at works we

00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:40,300
share it back to each other that's the

00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,890
way this stuff should work so the

00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,510
question of back compat and how it's

00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,970
holding us back back compat has

00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,560
prevented very very few patches from

00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,960
landing in the last few years before

00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:52,360
that I can't speak to but as long as

00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,980
I've been watching the list closely the

00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,770
number of things that haven't changed

00:31:53,980 --> 00:32:02,350
when we got a patch because if back

00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:05,620
compat is exceedingly low people don't

00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,640
supply patches and then we say know how

00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:10,570
many patches have not been written

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,940
because of that compact concerns we

00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:14,610
don't know because we don't get these

00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,500
reports sometimes someone will say I

00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:20,410
want to write a patch will you accept

00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,670
this sometimes we'll say well no that's

00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:24,070
just going to break too much stuff it's

00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:25,240
not within hour of our guaranteed

00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:28,530
service level it's call our service

00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,940
level agreement with the users of pearl

00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:32,170
but I think I get the impression there

00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,580
are a lot of people who say that pearl

00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:36,550
is being blocked by back and pack

00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:38,710
concerns with very little hard evidence

00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:40,120
that it's true I think there's a lot of

00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,300
assumptions being made about what

00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,590
happens on the discussion list without a

00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,940
lot of experience about what really

00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:48,160
happened so how many patches right have

00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,660
been discussed on the list until they

00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:54,520
don't happen all right how many been

00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:55,570
talked to death some some why do things

00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,180
get talked to death there's a couple

00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,830
reasons this is the best reason

00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,740
sometimes we figure out that was a bad

00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:05,110
idea right like I've got this cool idea

00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:07,300
for a feature and maybe even here's a

00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:09,940
patch to implement it can we do this and

00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:12,730
like but Olivia the mail starts coming

00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,380
in and after discussion which is

00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:16,510
usually civil technical interesting

00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,070
discussion sometimes two sometimes a lot

00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,510
of it and those of you who read every

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,730
message you know this there's a lot of

00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:23,980
it in general I think it's actually

00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,880
quite good sometimes we find out yeah

00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,450
you know what this wasn't a good idea

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,549
that's a good kind of talk to death

00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:32,140
sometimes we get people who are like yes

00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:34,720
well at feature seems pretty cool but

00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,910
shouldn't we also I don't know you know

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,880
this is this is the Congressional

00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:41,799
amendment syndrome like I really like

00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,049
your idea to make four loops faster but

00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:47,650
shouldn't we also have a postfix block

00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:49,900
oriented postfix for I don't know man

00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,340
shut up like take your own thread this

00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,490
is this is about something else that

00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:57,040
sometimes happens but but not often and

00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,120
usually people these things are snipped

00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,210
we say right that's a different topic

00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,770
let's talk about it another time and

00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,090
sometimes nobody's willing to decide the

00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,530
debate right there's there's two or

00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:08,560
three sides and they're all talking for

00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:11,050
a while and no one is seen in it goes on

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,379
and you need someone to say this is what

00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:16,450
we're gonna do this this came up on IRC

00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:18,639
just today how to deprecate something

00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:20,800
from the core first have a huge mailing

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,480
let's play more secondly after no

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:28,720
conclusive result deprecated anyway um I

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,980
think this is exactly right um we don't

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,210
actually have huge flame wars we have

00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,429
discussions sometimes there's too many

00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:35,580
people um sometimes there's too many

00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:38,109
people for it to be an easy conversation

00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,369
I don't think there's usually too many

00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,510
people for it to be civil I don't think

00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,940
it's usually a bad thing to have a lot

00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,350
of people building consensus is good

00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:47,139
sometimes you don't get consensus and

00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:48,490
the correct action there is not to take

00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:50,260
no action until leave it sitting on the

00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:52,629
table it's for something to be done

00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:54,490
right we all agree on the necessity of

00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:56,290
compromise but we can't agree when to

00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:58,450
compromise well another way to formulate

00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,560
this is we can't agree on an assess when

00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:01,990
it's we all agree it's necessary to

00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:06,090
compromise and i can tell you when we

00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:06,090
are going to compromise that

00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:13,800
that's that's the the thing that I think

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,450
is one of the most important things I

00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,390
can be doing for the project I don't

00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,920
write a lot of code for the core but

00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,840
when we get these big discussions the

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,980
important thing is first the first

00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,650
important thing is to have the

00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:28,740
discussion I really frown on these ideas

00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:30,300
of I want it I want to do something with

00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,940
no discussion I'm just going to push a

00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,590
change into into pearl um and and if

00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,840
people don't like it will we can talk

00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,190
about it later for the most part I think

00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,230
this is this is established as a bad

00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,770
culture it puts it puts committers on a

00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:44,640
different tier from other contributors

00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:45,870
we have a very limited number of

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,340
contributors to pearl most people have

00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:49,800
to submit a passion someone applies it

00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,300
and I don't think it works well so have

00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:56,040
the discussion first have the discussion

00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:59,130
and secondly end the discussion and end

00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,450
it on with with a statement right like

00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,770
thank you this has been a good

00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,660
discussion we are now going to do what

00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,880
we all agreed on or thank you this was a

00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:09,060
good discussion we are going to do this

00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,860
particular option or that we really

00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,110
can't tell what to do we're going to do

00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:16,440
more research off list and we'll revisit

00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:19,170
this later I have not always succeeded

00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,110
in doing these things I try and when I

00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:24,030
fail I hope people will politely remind

00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:26,760
me that I failed and that we should get

00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:29,700
these things sorted but to me talking

00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,040
something to death is good as long as

00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,560
the death is an execution carried out in

00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:41,040
by intention right that we say good it's

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:42,480
done let's keep going um okay questions

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:49,520
about that that whole section they're

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,520
talking about that okay oh yes

00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:02,690
actual pearl release there's more than

00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,890
just the test suite you look it Akeno

00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:07,170
rechecked everyone is like is this okay

00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:09,869
or any important mazel is breaking if

00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:11,340
you were to codify the way that that

00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:13,590
curl release is going to have an effect

00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,150
on the whole world of pearl if you can

00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,590
codify that and run it then you can have

00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,650
a lot more companies you could go back

00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:21,960
to say these three things break yep so

00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:26,700
the comment was if we could if we could

00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,530
say let's say automate if we if we could

00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,610
automatically or by regulations say

00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,930
here's a change we're thinking about

00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:33,270
putting in how much will it break that

00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,680
would be awesome it is awesome stefan

00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:37,110
molar has built a system for doing this

00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,090
um it's it's great and i love it

00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:42,270
unfortunately um it's a little tough to

00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:44,070
use um just because like Stefan made it

00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,690
go it's really fantastic and he keeps

00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,040
saying other people please use this so

00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,619
that we can like figure out how to make

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,110
it great and everyone else says yeah

00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:53,760
I'll get around to it and I'm super

00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:55,530
guilty of this but we have a mechanism

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,630
and I really really wanted to get better

00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,920
and maybe we can talk about as a

00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,150
community though some of you will

00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,940
volunteer to help make it better talk

00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:06,420
send me an email or whatever that we can

00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,950
say smoke all of Sipan at this commit

00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,869
and I'm going to merge some crazy

00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,130
changes in and then smoke the whole seat

00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:13,560
pan again and tell me what's different

00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,690
it has been super useful when we've used

00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:19,670
it super useful so yes you're totally

00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,670
right we've we've done it and it's great

00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:30,450
yeah we tried yeah um okay pearl needs

00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:32,460
hackers um so why aren't why aren't we

00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:34,020
making like awesome why haven't you

00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,130
added this to pearl why does pearl still

00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,130
have this stupid feature why are

00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:39,450
exceptions still strings why is like a

00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:42,090
lot of the time it's not that we don't

00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,470
want to change it's not that we want not

00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:45,060
to change its not that we want to stay

00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:50,580
the same it's that we don't have a patch

00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:54,900
um I have written to I think two patches

00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:57,990
to the pearl C code one of them added a

00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,880
warning so I'm sorry the other I'm going

00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:02,070
to mention this because it's it is one

00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,400
of my favorite changes in 5 18 and maybe

00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:07,890
none of you will care on non-windows in

00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:12,650
516 and earlier what happens if you run

00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:17,160
pearl space directory name anyone

00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:19,080
it does nothing at exit 0 in Perl 5 18

00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:23,790
it will exit nonzero and give you a

00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:26,280
warning god I love that because I always

00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:29,310
I always right pearl dash I lib lib

00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,020
program right and it tries it's like Oh

00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:33,540
lives of directory whatevs it's cool um

00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,730
right and the reason that that got fixed

00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,830
is that I just lost it I couldn't take

00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:41,280
it anymore somebody somebody brought up

00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:44,370
this problem and and I was motivated

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,800
enough by this problem which I had every

00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:47,940
day to go look at the source and fix it

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,670
now the reason i picked something so

00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,590
easy is that i am a miserable see

00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:55,620
programmer i think that patch went

00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:58,920
through like 5 iterations before it like

00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:01,680
worked and it was like a two line it's

00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,640
the two line patch um but but I did it

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,200
because I really really wanted to fix

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,910
stuff so people who really really want

00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,010
to fix stuff should should send patches

00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:10,170
because if you have heard that we will

00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,660
talk you to death we won't we'll have a

00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:14,460
conversation with you it'll be awesome

00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:16,560
if you heard that we don't we want to

00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,150
not change it's not true i like changing

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,440
i think the pearl can keep getting more

00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:22,080
pearl ash and more awesome it's going to

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,540
be great send us patches it's you'll

00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,580
have a good time we'll have a good time

00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:28,620
i'll give you a nickel for four I don't

00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:32,850
know a patch maybe I don't have that

00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:34,080
many nickels wooden nickels well yeah

00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,190
somebody pick me up a whole bunch of

00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,670
wooden nickels and keep them at your

00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:42,210
house for me and it will do that most of

00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:44,670
our patches um more than half like

00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:49,020
two-thirds of our patches come from for

00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:54,210
people for committers of the remaining

00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:57,480
30 some percent uh many of them are are

00:40:54,210 --> 00:41:00,450
not they're not features their tiny bug

00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,520
fixes documentation fixes really good

00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:06,390
stuff like I love documentation fixes I

00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:10,200
love to in the last year one percent of

00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:11,370
the commits in Perl 5 were made by this

00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,720
guy who's now I'm going to get it wrong

00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:16,340
so I'm not going to say it look him up

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,320
he's in the charts David who submitted

00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,820
so many typos fixes that he is

00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,470
responsible for one percent of the

00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:28,520
commits that's awesome it's awesome

00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:30,890
thank you thank you um yes Davis timer

00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,650
thing thank you very much um those are

00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:37,670
great but like things that are adding

00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:40,280
features or or or really uh rejiggering

00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:43,340
the code we don't have a lot of those

00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,770
coming in and pearl is not dead right I

00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,960
if I was going to write almost almost

00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:50,000
anything these days I would start in

00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,890
pearl like there's some some domains

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
where I wouldn't but oh but pearls great

00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,770
people write new stuff in it all the

00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,210
time it's fantastic and anyone who says

00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:58,550
that people aren't writing pearl is

00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:00,320
insane like the argument that nobody

00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:02,660
writes stuff and pearl anymore dude like

00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:07,430
everybody everybody writes stuff in

00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:09,920
pearl but um pearl dot C is kind of on

00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:11,990
life support right now and I think it's

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,820
because there's a division between the

00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,740
people who are writing everything in

00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,900
pearl and the people who are writing

00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,430
pearl itself there's not enough people

00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:21,440
who come in and work on stuff and yeah

00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:25,490
okay it's Jenga right like the Perl code

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,920
bases it's nasty um but we can make it

00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:29,599
less nasty a little less nasty we can

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,520
still make changes inside the nasty code

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,530
base like people should come and

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,849
participate and we'll get that number up

00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,140
right most of our patches will come from

00:42:34,849 --> 00:42:38,150
six people eight people 10 people

00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:40,190
eventually it would be a stupid bullet

00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:42,200
point because the commit list will be

00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,730
you know all these little little boxes

00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,900
that aren't worth dividing into these

00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:49,880
four and everybody else everybody in

00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,990
this room is a doctor in the sense if

00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,200
pearls on life support you're all

00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:56,390
programmers just about like maybe you

00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,070
don't write a lot of see well you can

00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,300
learn C and if you don't want to learn c

00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,830
you can work on other stuff that's in

00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,760
the pearl core and if you don't want to

00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,640
learn other stuff that's in the pearl

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,550
core you can tell us what stuff have you

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,830
been writing in Perl that is really

00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:11,750
busted because of some pearl behavior

00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:14,330
that could be fixed or could be extended

00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:18,349
you can tell us what does the pearl

00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:22,550
levels what does pearl space need from

00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:23,690
pearl see to get better but the best

00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:27,470
thing you can do is write patches to

00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:30,260
give us that for reals pearl hackers new

00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:33,260
code review people who are yet people

00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:36,490
who are sending us patches are not often

00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:38,270
enough getting feedback on their patches

00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,970
this is a tough

00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:43,670
problem I don't know what we're going to

00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:45,290
do about this I really don't we have a

00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:48,500
limited number of people who can provide

00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:50,630
this review and they're they're doing

00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:53,090
review on maybe they could do more

00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:55,610
review which means maybe they could fix

00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,660
a lot stuff in Pearl and that's not

00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:59,570
saying one of those is better than the

00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:02,330
other there that's a tough choice and if

00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:04,670
we're going to get new committers new

00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:08,270
contributors those people need code

00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:10,460
review and the people who get that code

00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:12,920
of you at least some of them need to

00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:14,810
stick around and do more code of you

00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,060
that's how we have to to build a

00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:19,430
community of maintained errs and

00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:24,950
contributors and engineers for the Pearl

00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:26,120
core okay we have one and a half minutes

00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:31,730
for me to tell you all my hopes and

00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:32,900
dreams okay so it's pretty fast other

00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:34,790
things I want to see happen in the next

00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,260
release or two of pearl if you give

00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:38,840
patches for these and the patches are

00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,880
good I will give you a lot of nickels

00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:45,620
and a high five and Sawyer will give you

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:48,230
a hug okay fatal implicit clothes right

00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:50,150
if you have some file handle and you

00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:51,770
fall off the end if the clothes fails

00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:54,320
right now nothing happens that should be

00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:56,120
fatal you this is like Lex go file

00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,650
handles the anonymous file handles an

00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:00,560
electrical variable or whatever you want

00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:01,940
to call them they're great because they

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,170
auto close and they're terrible because

00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,770
the auto close throws away any air

00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:08,840
condition ah this needs to get fixed

00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:15,290
post fix dereferencing okay this this

00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:17,780
one I will oh my god okay so everybody

00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:20,330
hates pearls dereferencing syntax a ton

00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:23,090
everyone hates it so how do we try to

00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:26,030
fix this while we added we add an auto

00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:28,370
dereferencing right so you don't have to

00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:30,530
put that on there which is ok but only

00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:31,880
works in some contexts and there are

00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:34,400
other problems you can't at compile-time

00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,350
know that you're asserting this thing is

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,970
an array reference in the same way

00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:41,690
because there's no sigil in place what

00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:43,160
if you could say this right still read

00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:45,320
your dereferencing left to right please

00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,740
don't focus on which sigils I chose the

00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:50,750
love of God read things from left to

00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:52,130
right at the end you say

00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:54,320
then get the array out of this array

00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:55,550
reference then you can even use it on

00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,230
the right side instead of pushing

00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:58,910
something was in a list which you can't

00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:00,700
do now with auto dereferencing it has to

00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:03,020
be the left argument you could do this

00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,280
or if you had a scalar reference you

00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,470
could you know dereference it is a

00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:12,740
scalar like that or if you had a glob

00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:15,920
reference maybe not um real exceptions

00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:17,120
who doesn't want non string exceptions

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,400
in corporal who wants to stick with

00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:23,510
strings forever which of you are

00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:26,270
trolling okay um wouldn't this be great

00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:27,400
yes um better types I'm going over I'm

00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:29,930
going to finish really really soon

00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,470
better types yes like character versus

00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:37,100
byte strings versus buffs if I ever

00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:38,630
switch all of my code to Perl 6 it will

00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:42,110
be because they have distinct strings

00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:44,660
and buffers oh my gosh unbelievably

00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:48,740
important any good can we get stuff like

00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:51,560
this into pro 5 maybe maybe we should

00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:53,570
figure it out auto boxing I don't know

00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,800
if we can do this in a way that's going

00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:57,320
to be great for everybody but like

00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,660
autoboxing auto boxing is good somebody

00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,900
saying no well yeah oh it's chip chip

00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:05,570
asset chip is saying no to something

00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:06,830
amazing no I mean autoboxing autoboxing

00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,620
has big problems like can it be done

00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:12,170
maybe it's can it be done maybe should

00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:14,000
it be done maybe but it should be

00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:18,080
investigated and we should document our

00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,410
findings we've been very bad at that mro

00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:23,690
magic we need we need magic mro if you

00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:26,840
don't know what it is a search for magic

00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:28,820
mro are jbs advent it is a feature that

00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,010
will make many things including them an

00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:32,840
object protocol much easier in problem

00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:36,590
okay we have negative one and a half

00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:41,240
minutes who has a question yes the blue

00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:43,820
shirt how do you convince admins to

00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:46,160
upgrade the first thing you do is buy

00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:47,900
them beer or whatever drink they prefer

00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,040
the second thing you do is to show them

00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,900
the Delta show them all the bugs that

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,310
are fixed the third thing you do is that

00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,040
when they're drinking the beer you drop

00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:57,880
in some kind of sedative and you upgrade

00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,880
while they're out

00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:21,980
um yeah yeah well no I hope that was a

00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:23,420
joke uh okay next uh yep right so the

00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,289
question is how do we tell me this is

00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,819
the question the question is how do we

00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:28,930
take something experimental and say it's

00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:31,099
not experimental anymore well the

00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:32,210
there's two answers that one is we take

00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:33,410
away the warning and we take it out of

00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:35,569
the experimental document but that's not

00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:37,339
that's not the interesting answer the

00:48:35,569 --> 00:48:38,750
interesting answer is that after we have

00:48:37,339 --> 00:48:41,630
an experimental feature we need to have

00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:43,010
acceptance criteria for it we don't have

00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:44,780
those for our current experimental

00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:46,400
features I think that's okay you can

00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:48,579
start an experiment without knowing

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,780
whether or not you're going to accept it

00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:53,240
some of these for some of these features

00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:55,460
it's clear the acceptance criteria for

00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,440
lexical subroutines is gonna mostly I

00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:59,510
think be related to the bugs are gone

00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,819
the obvious bugs are gone it's working

00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:02,839
things were like lexical topic the

00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:05,059
acceptance criteria are gonna be

00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:07,339
something like it's less confusing but

00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:09,230
we need to establish those and we need

00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:10,730
to establish those review them and when

00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:12,619
we say that they have been reviewed and

00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:14,359
we're happy with them we take off the

00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:16,220
warning we put an announcement that it's

00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:21,130
not experimental anymore and I talked

00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:21,130
about it my talk the next year uh Martin

00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:42,470
what's okay there's two answers to that

00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:44,059
um one is which is the document for new

00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:48,140
contributors working on the core pearl

00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:49,640
pearl hack toot there's a couple there's

00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:52,160
a couple pearl docks I think the one you

00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,539
want is pearl hack toot which is like

00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,599
hey I want to hack on Pearl what we need

00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:58,250
to do there's a bunch of these kind of

00:49:56,599 --> 00:50:00,380
documents there's pearl hack pearl hack

00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:01,640
to pearl hat pearl repo pearl get I

00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:03,619
think pearl hack to is the one you want

00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,180
I haven't had to read it in a while and

00:50:03,619 --> 00:50:06,770
it's it's it's shameful that I don't

00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,640
know the answer to tell you because I

00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,400
should be able to tell anybody who asks

00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:14,390
me and I'll find it out for the next guy

00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:18,950
and the other thing is how do you learn

00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:21,830
the internals I don't know I think the

00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:23,750
answer is you start by trying to figure

00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:25,370
stuff out you talk to people on on p5p

00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:28,340
be at the IRC channel of the mailing

00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:30,860
list and unfortunately right now this

00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:33,140
will involve some amount of convincing

00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:36,020
them you're for real by which I mean I

00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:38,780
am working on doing this I know I have

00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:40,490
to start with X I've done that much leg

00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,920
work how much does X have to be not much

00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:44,390
I've done a little work I need to do

00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,010
something in this file to get started

00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:49,730
can you tell me on any amount of

00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:50,780
information once we have more experts

00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:52,610
we're not even exit once you have more

00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,350
people who know anything about the core

00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:56,630
and who are willing to give review this

00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:57,620
will become very easy I want to do

00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:59,210
something where do I look for that in

00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,770
here great i'll go do something it's

00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:02,480
going to become a rapid feedback cycle

00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:04,190
right now this feedback cycle is not

00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,630
rapid it's slow and erratic and its

00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:07,100
really bad and that's something we need

00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,270
to fix and the way we fix it by this by

00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:11,300
getting more and more people working on

00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:13,220
it we're running late I don't know

00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,720
what's going on now so if I need to shut

00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:18,380
up I will if there are more questions

00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:21,550
I'll answer them otherwise I love you

00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,550
