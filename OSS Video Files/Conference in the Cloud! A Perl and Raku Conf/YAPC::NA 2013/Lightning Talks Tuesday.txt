alright well they're getting set up i'm

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,750
going to do a little a little lightning

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:13,410
talks and screen so we used to be a

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:16,980
community of startups 10 years ago there

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:20,130
was no such company as booking now

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,539
booking donates regularly hundreds of

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,400
thousands of dollars to the pearl

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,070
community so that we can do things like

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,740
this right they're not the only one

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,720
shutterstock there used to be these

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,050
other big companies like Amazon and eBay

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,450
that were entirely pearl and now they've

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,430
either left pearl entirely or they only

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,610
use pearl as part of it we used to be a

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,829
community of startups these days we

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,789
don't see that many startups and I wish

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:50,940
we would see more I am one of the few

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,680
that I know of at least that dude knows

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,480
a lot of pearl startups and I would love

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,190
to see more people doing this I would

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,920
love to see more people succeed in it I

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,140
tend to do about one and one new startup

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,989
a year not saying everybody should do

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,810
that it's crazy don't do it but what you

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,490
should do is just build something the

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,650
reason you should do this is it's going

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,860
to help you for one if you do if you do

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,090
well you're going to make money if you

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,060
do poorly you're going to learn

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,340
something okay but beyond that you're

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,310
going to help pearl you help pearl in

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,220
two ways when you do a start-up one you

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,170
bring awareness to pearl you bring

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,270
awareness to the fact that pearl is an

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,840
important relevant language that

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:37,229
startups build on top of ok it'll bring

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,670
more people to pearl and you're bringing

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,650
more money to pearl which brings more

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,329
jobs to pearl which automatically brings

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,720
more people to pearl if there are jobs

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:48,780
people will come find those jobs right

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,070
so do a start-up build something it

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,869
doesn't matter what it is it could be

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,420
something simple like a blog it could be

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,130
something complex like a video game it

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,320
really doesn't matter what the startup

00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,850
is just build something and if you need

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,979
help building something if you need to

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,219
help getting started I'm willing to help

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,229

come up front soon I'm giving your spot

00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:24,009
away and I'm giving it back to the

00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:31,419
person who I bumped to tomorrow in the

00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:33,579
first place my name is Henry van Styne

00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:39,699
this is my first yep see it's really

00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:42,099
been awesome so this is a really

00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:44,739
impromptu presentation I am going to

00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:46,449
tell you about application framework

00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:48,489
that we've been developing for the last

00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:52,059
few years called rapid app it's based on

00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:55,169
pearl catalyst xjs basically what it

00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:58,719
does is it provides a way to generate

00:05:55,169 --> 00:06:03,869
interfaces for DB IC schemas very

00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:06,759
quickly and it basically ties ties the

00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:10,299
DB IC schema all the way through to the

00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:14,049
front end to the XJS data store which

00:06:10,299 --> 00:06:16,509
provides full crud and interactive

00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:18,459
capabilities on top of that so I think

00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,839
the best way to demonstrate that is with

00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:22,989
some live demos which is what i have

00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,519
here and this is a live site and you can

00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:25,899
i'll give you the login you can actually

00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,879
log in and play with this if you're

00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:29,469
interested but hopefully that won't

00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:30,669
crash the server of too many people are

00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:33,999
interested but we'll see that'll be

00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:36,489
interesting so I wanted to UM to do a

00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:39,549
demo I wanted to find some sample data

00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:42,009
to pull in so what this application is

00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:44,189
here this mime cast this is a quick data

00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:47,589
model that I put together to represent

00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:50,079
email messages and so what I did is I

00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:52,629
just packed this model together and then

00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,009
I loaded it with data from some common

00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:58,319
pearl mailing list so that we can look

00:06:54,009 --> 00:07:01,299
at some real data and play with it so um

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,509
here's a the this sort of the standard

00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:07,509
view is the grid view which you know is

00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:11,289
sortable you know you can move these

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:15,779
things around adjust the order of things

00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:19,149
um you know double click to view items

00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,520
and then also apply you know

00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:24,969
miscellaneous kinds of filters so we can

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,210
build we can build queries we have a

00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:33,969
query editor so i can say add a

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:35,619
condition they that date is after and it

00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:37,539
understands the data model i didn't have

00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:40,059
to tell it that this interface should be

00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:42,219
a date selector it knows because it

00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:45,159
knows the data model and automatically

00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:48,459
provides appropriate interfaces so i can

00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:51,039
select you know a time frame apply that

00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:53,319
and you know boom it'll do that and

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,229
there's also other bells and whistles i

00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:59,919
can actually just type in i can say

00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:03,449
minus one month for instance and it'll

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:06,610
be minus one month and there's other um

00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:09,129
you know we can add you know you know

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,619
and this is a you know you can build

00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:13,719
this out to a whole querystring a whole

00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:18,430
query structure of you know whatever you

00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:20,889
can think of but also so there's other

00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,319
other capabilities again it understands

00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:25,809
the it understands the data model so it

00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,389
understands things like like this is a

00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:30,789
size call this is an integer field so we

00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:35,409
have similar functions and so it'll

00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:37,389
provide summary functions that oops that

00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,699
makes sense to that so i can like do a

00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:42,579
total and now boom it's going to total

00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:45,699
up that column 34k i can for other other

00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:47,800
things like like from which this is just

00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:50,860
going to be a you know a VAR char in the

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,740
back end summary function could be you

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,389
know count unique so there you go is for

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,810
unique from addresses in that time range

00:08:55,389 --> 00:09:00,790
that we saw there and so then once

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,560
you've built up one of these nice views

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,970
that he has all sorts of rules and then

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,310
of course you can you know you can do

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,130
searches we can just type in you know

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:11,319
search terms there's something that's

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,509
probably going to have entries in anyway

00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:17,529
so once you once you've built up this

00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:20,189
view you can go ahead and save it you

00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,189
know as whatever

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,740
and now this view has been saved and

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,410
here it is now in this navigation tree I

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,850
can organize navet REE and then let's

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,380
say I want to make this public here

00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,279
here's my new one that I just created I

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:40,459
can just drag this stuff around I can

00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:42,709
you know make a new folder now I can

00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:44,480
drag stuff into it you know and then

00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,519
that just persist immediately and boom

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,259
it saves it now that's there so what's

00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,699
really cool our client that uses this is

00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:53,360
they're able to build an author their

00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:55,670
own views just add the box so this one

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,459
is a this is a read-only this is a

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:03,670
read-only interface really quick i'll

00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:07,430
show you I'll show you one that is

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:11,480
writable and this is another demo and

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:15,190
this is I'll leave this up we can I

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,190
don't have enough time to show anything

00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:21,380
but so we can till here's here something

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:24,380
that's editable i lighted it from the

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:26,600
grid I can you know here is a category

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,130
this is actually a relationship so I'm

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,829
editing the relationships automatically

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,660
giving me a drop-down like in this

00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:33,949
editor interface is actually opens

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,139
another grid so I can actually then

00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:37,819
search in the grid select an item these

00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:40,279
are relationship columns anyway I'm

00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:41,899
probably about to get buzzed out so let

00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,660
me leave with if you want to play with

00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:47,569
this here are the the two sites that

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:50,329
I've just looked at here username and

00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:52,399
password and and you can it's all test

00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:54,800
data so you can go crazy and trash it

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,930
and do whatever and if you're interested

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:02,060
in helping me on this project Thank that

00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,269
thing so here is blow thank you very

00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,269
much

00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:17,410
I took the microphone from somebody hey

00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:19,569
so tonight we are close to the to the

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,029
bridge what is a congress street bridge

00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:23,709
where there are about a million bats

00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:26,949
coming out around sunset around

00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:30,249
eight-thirty 1 p.m. give or take so i'm

00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:32,799
gonna be walking from our dinner down

00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:35,199
there to try and watch these bats so if

00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,429
anybody wants to come around we're going

00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:47,889
to take a quick walk it's only a few

00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:51,249
blocks away Thanks hi I'm Mike grab i

00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:55,029
work at low note this is monitoring fire

00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:56,949
and ems dispatch with pearl when I look

00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:59,139
out my window I see the ambulances

00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:03,309
pulling out of the driveway and hear

00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:07,119
them and since I'm nosy I'm want to know

00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:11,379
where they're going and you hear some

00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:15,579
great stuff two weeks ago EMS got

00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:18,999
dispatched to pick up a patient at a old

00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:21,399
folks home and they said I'm sorry we're

00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:23,410
not sure the location within the

00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:27,540
facility they're still chasing the

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:30,369
patient around we'll get that to you I

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,230
like to think of a ninety-year-old naked

00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:39,190
person running around

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:42,220
yelling all the stuff all my stuff is in

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:46,140
galloway township and that's where it is

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,920
so basic basic theory your

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:52,090
walkie-talkies you had when you were

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:54,760
eight simplex operation they listen and

00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:57,640
transmit on the same frequency with a

00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,830
repeater you listen and transmit on a

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,230
different frequency when you press the

00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:05,400
talk button your radio automatically

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:09,040
switches to the transmitted frequency

00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:12,130
some are Peter with a giant antenna up

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,770
on a pole listens and rebroadcast that

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:17,380
out on the listen frequency so everybody

00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:20,380
in the area can hear you you can take

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:24,220
that a step further with a digital

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,870
trunking system and to explain it in

00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,780
this amount of time we'll just look at

00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,530
the atlantic county system which has

00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,990
seven distinct sites 14 ms

00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:37,720
municipalities use it 50 agencies they

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:41,290
have 181 talk groups which think of that

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:45,580
as like an IRC channel or on an old

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:48,060
simplex radio that would be frequency so

00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,760
if you were going to do basic repeating

00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:56,140
for that many talk groups you need 362

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,270
frequencies and that doesn't scale so

00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:01,390
here's an example of what some of those

00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:05,230
talk groups look like this is the actual

00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:07,960
galloway township talk groups of note

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:11,560
police one there has addy that's digital

00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:14,050
and that makes me sad because I can't

00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:18,280
listen to it without spinning on another

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:21,550
thousand bucks so this is my setup at

00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:26,170
home I have a unit in HP one which is

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:28,780
about 500 bucks much my wife's dismay it

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:31,590
connects to a netbook which then streams

00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:34,570
it out to my linode including metadata

00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:39,130
for what frequency and person is

00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:41,320
transmitting from there it's a published

00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,649
icecast stream and I have lots of little

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,600
pearl utilities

00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:50,050
at listen to that stream and do cool

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:53,480
stuff this f.i.c /f pls is awesome it's

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:58,129
a see app that will listen to a nice

00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:00,379
cast dream it can pipe the audio to

00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:03,709
standard out so that you can pipe it on

00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:07,100
into something else I use it to generate

00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:10,639
hourly mp3's with all of the silence

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:15,230
removed so a typical hour-long mp3

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:18,379
becomes anywhere from zero seconds to

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:26,929
three or four minutes really active ones

00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:29,240
are maybe 10-12 minutes I actually call

00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:31,519
that previous command from a perl script

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,879
that kicks it off once an hour so we

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:39,199
have individual mp3's one per hour it

00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:41,540
also reads the meta data stream and you

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,579
see down there at the bottom it looks up

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,129
like the user ID I have a text table

00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:48,679
that translates user IDs to human

00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:54,699
readable things like dispatch and medics

00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:54,699
to it also color codes on standard out I

00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:02,480
also recently wrote a script perl script

00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:07,429
that analyzes the dispatch tones which

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:17,959
sound like this there they're very quiet

00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:20,990
you have to really listen no so it's

00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:25,040
just a couple tones and if you did a

00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:27,889
manual FFT you'd see this but somebody

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,009
made a really awesome module called

00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:33,410
audio analyzer and with that much code

00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:37,160
you can perform an FFT on a chunk of

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:39,949
audio I do it in real time I detect the

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,949
dispatch tones again i have a lookup

00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:44,660
table a lot of municipalities are weird

00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:46,399
and think that this is a security risk

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,100
for the public to know this so they

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,610
won't just tell you you have to brute

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,610
force it

00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:05,170
yes that means I set fires at prescribed

00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:09,970
locations to get the station i'm

00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:13,270
interested in dispatched i also monitor

00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:18,490
and synapse SMS is to me to tell me that

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:28,360
 might be real and the ten-second

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:32,860
live demo nevermind go to dick Galloway

00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:37,500
now calm if you want to see it hi

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:39,430
everyone so there was a message an

00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,900
advertisement earlier about going to

00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:43,360
visit the wood nickel factory in San

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,070
Antonio I'm at loose ends on thursday

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,290
and i really want to go down to Lockhart

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:53,350
and visit all for barbecue restaurants

00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:55,030
down there I know it's cliche like a fat

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:59,470
guy that wants to go to BBQ restaurant

00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:01,990
but um I'm a cliche so anyway I have a

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:04,390
car and I have seating for two more

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,510
people so if you're interested in going

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:10,530
to Lockhart and then down San Antonio

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,530
come and find me thanks

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,270
hi my name is Andrew dougherty I'm

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,320
interested in artificial intelligence

00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:28,360
and improving pearls competitivity in

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:38,590
that area so I just I believe this that

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:43,390
is some oops I don't believe that oh is

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:47,740
it still down oops thought it was a one

00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:50,320
second so anyway um just in case I spend

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,760
all the time debugging this I just

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,780
wanted to say that I have a display

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:59,140
outside and I need help making releasing

00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:06,700
the packages for Sipan I've about 2,000

00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:27,789
of them that do various AI things okay i

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:30,460
can leave or I can go for it okay so

00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:33,130
it's just it's good to help people with

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:36,760
tools that solve problems as you all

00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:40,179
know so 14 years I've been working on it

00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:43,330
2,000 modules I have AP I used to rap

00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:45,059
most open source AI applications and i

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:48,039
also have software i'm making a

00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:50,200
comprehensive ontology of all the floss

00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:52,210
software out there well using floss move

00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,480
to bootstrap it but with natural

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,480
language processing

00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:12,890
hey some AI capabilities does practical

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,090
reasoning general game playing natural

00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:18,830
language processing text mining

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:20,270
inference and semantic web some general

00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,550
purpose capabilities because it's a

00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:25,460
social software the purpose is to help

00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:28,280
people provide a social safety net free

00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,710
life planning temporal planning and

00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,600
execution personal finance meal planning

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,970
document management job search system

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:50,840
and distributed team based problem

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:52,420
solving and and so my goal is to get one

00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,210
module on Sipan I'd really appreciate

00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:59,120
anyone and willing to pay to get the

00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,340
process started see my panel display and

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,800
also if anyone wants to review my code

00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:07,870
and vouch for my grant application to

00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,870
the pearl foundation thanks

00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:24,149
how do I turn this on is it on awesome

00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:26,129
all right hi there my name is Dave roll

00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:28,619
ski and apparently I just volunteered to

00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:35,009
join the Pearl foundation fundraising

00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:37,229
committee earlier today any member i'm

00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:39,719
going to do a little pitch for you so

00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:41,429
the pro Foundation exists to support the

00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:43,080
pearl community and it does that in

00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:45,179
various ways so one of the ways is it

00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,909
helps conference organizers put on

00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:50,969
events like Yap see for example and

00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:53,249
various / workshops around the world TBF

00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:57,809
also provides grants to support work on

00:21:53,249 --> 00:22:00,659
pearl projects they've given over 150

00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:02,849
thousand dollars in grants on for pearl

00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:06,119
five core maintenance work for example

00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:08,399
and there's also a new outreach program

00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,989
for women in open source working with

00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:11,879
the gnome foundation we have somebody

00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:13,739
who's contributing to Moose through that

00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:16,349
and she's getting paid to work on that

00:22:13,739 --> 00:22:18,599
which is fantastic and there's also a

00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:22,619
lot of behind-the-scenes work don't ding

00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:25,619
me like legal issues dealing with

00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:27,179
trademark stuff like that now you might

00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:29,399
think that the pro foundation gets

00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:31,019
funded just through corporate donations

00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:35,099
but we also need the support of

00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:39,450
community members like yourself you make

00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:42,320
a living from pearl Jimmy agree keep it

00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:45,919
real healthy is in your best interest

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,919
I'm not done yet

00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:55,200
give me 15 seconds you get you get you

00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,200
get take a minute you could take a

00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:03,570
minute it's okay that's on cool so I'm

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,370
just going to talk briefly about one of

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,880
the options that you have that Matt

00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:09,750
trout actually talked about some

00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,080
continuous integration tools are

00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,340
basically a tool to help you push things

00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,750
out to your environment and hopefully

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:23,340
maintain some stuff so so I'm Adam I go

00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:24,690
by stylist heater on IRC and first off

00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:27,330
actually I wanted to echo a statement

00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:30,000
that was made earlier mrs. my first yap

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:34,050
see it's really freaking awesome and I

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,230
love you guys but I especially love Matt

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:42,000
trout I mean so Jenkins like I said is a

00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:44,250
could call it i guess continuous

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,740
integration server it's written in java

00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,660
and way I run it as I put it on top of

00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,270
tom cat and then put a patchy in front

00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,220
of it so the reason why we use it at my

00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:55,530
work is that so I started we have a

00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,690
couple hundred servers we have a bunch

00:23:55,530 --> 00:24:00,090
of Perl scripts that do monitoring so my

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,770
work I work at a bank I unfortunately

00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:04,200
take care of really buggy middleware

00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:06,600
systems and really crappy code that runs

00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:09,320
on top of those so it's even worse but

00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,670
we use it to do a whole slew of things

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,560
one popular script of course is an out

00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,390
of memory monitor script that runs

00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,580
across the entire environment but since

00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:20,160
you have hundreds of servers how do you

00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:21,990
make sure that that proper script is

00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,000
pushed out to that many servers on top

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,290
of three different environments and oh

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,940
by the way there's also this one

00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:29,430
environment in AIX there's another one

00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:33,390
in Solaris it's just all kind of spread

00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:35,280
out nastiness basically so I came in and

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,560
one thing we started doing which was

00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,420
really dumb but we have to because of

00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,060
security concerns is actually building

00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,470
kind of our own Sipan and actually

00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,240
reinventing a lot of modules that are

00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,980
out there ready so how do you keep this

00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,630
stuff consistent well you can use our

00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,150
sink and actually this is kind of a

00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:53,460
wrapper around our sink in some ways but

00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,669
what we do is we have get set up and we

00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,710
have a post receive post commit hook

00:24:56,669 --> 00:25:01,470
that then calls Jenkins and then that

00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:03,539
workflow basically then checks out the

00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:06,690
code and actually does the push model

00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:08,879
not to pull model sorry Matt and make

00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:10,470
sure that all the scripts are consistent

00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:13,049
across the environment so once someone

00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:15,059
commits code to get it just triggered

00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:16,499
automatically and boom all the systems

00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,609
are up to date it's really nice and the

00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:18,690
less of course they're offline and

00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:24,080
networks down or something like that and

00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:26,639
then typically we have other issues so

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,889
typical idea is that you want to migrate

00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:30,840
stuff from say dev to prod or and then

00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:33,690
monkey patch prod because you didn't do

00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,269
it properly in the first time around and

00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:41,220
then essentially you can use this tool

00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:45,960
which I'll do quick just tell you what

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:57,659
it looks like you can use this tool then

00:25:45,960 --> 00:26:01,529
to make sure that oh not fail wow

00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:09,600
awesome fail let's try it again do we

00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:11,549
have a winner and we do Hey so basically

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,019
I you have this section and the upper

00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:15,330
left you can create new jobs and new

00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:18,389
jobs it's really just an ad hoc approach

00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:21,359
jobs so many different plugins exists

00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:23,850
that its kind of crazy in terms of

00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,590
what's available you can go out here and

00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:30,570
it'll tell you if plugins are out of

00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:32,999
date blah blah blah OOP wrong button so

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:35,700
all of these plugins are available and

00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:37,889
it just goes on and on and on and on

00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,299
plugins a tie-in to maven plugin to tie

00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:41,850
into aunt plugins and tighten the git

00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:44,190
plugin zip tie into PVCs really awful

00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,629
virgin in control system and just about

00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,509
anything out there really and what you

00:26:45,629 --> 00:26:50,279
do is you create a workflow and you plug

00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:52,169
these pieces in and they give you

00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:55,109
different functionality so say you want

00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:56,659
to have this crazy ant build script that

00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:58,889
does all this stuff and then you want to

00:26:56,659 --> 00:27:01,320
slap in a different version control

00:26:58,889 --> 00:27:04,980
system or you want to mix in maybe

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,169
starting up a a vm with vagrant or

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,320
something like that or spin up something

00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:10,149
else you can kind of just creating

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,269
these ad hoc workflows to do a lot for

00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:15,429
you so what I use it for actually is out

00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:18,669
here reviving the Cleavon perl mongers

00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:21,970
and I just have a job out here that

00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:24,610
whenever I push code it runs it stops

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:26,769
hypnotoad it starts hypnotoad after

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:29,019
copying everything out I know you don't

00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:30,759
necessarily need to do that but just

00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:33,700
making sure it does that and then I also

00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:35,590
make sure that I do a said substitution

00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,049
on a variable so there's a time stamp

00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,539
associated with when that change went

00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:42,909
out there so it's a pretty cool tool to

00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:44,919
use we've used it also in addition to

00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:47,860
keeping things synchronized to actually

00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,899
do installations because Jenkins allows

00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:52,059
you to actually create parameters and

00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:53,649
really strict use of parameters to make

00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:56,169
sure that they're integer or string or

00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:57,940
whatever option and we actually do

00:27:56,169 --> 00:28:01,679
installation of Apache and installation

00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:01,679
of our middleware systems with it so

00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:18,820
anyone here are the Fitbit is anyone in

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:21,080
the fit the perl mongers fitbit group

00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:23,179
like two or three of us anyone want to

00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,279
join it's very simple search for perl

00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:39,919
mongers in the fitbit communities and

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:41,630
you can join our group that's it so any

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,770
of you want peril and Android I mean you

00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,899
have an android phone something like

00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:47,000
that because pretty recently the peril

00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:49,909
foundation sare grant to get pearl work

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,190
here in android and it's there just need

00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:54,830
all of you to come by and test it so if

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:57,380
you want pearl android come Mac me I'm

00:28:54,830 --> 00:29:01,730
the guy with the AFC t-shirt is only 200

00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:04,460
of us and I'll try to help you install

00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:12,950
it on or compile it or we'll see so

00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:15,830
thank you I want to talk a little bit

00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:18,320
about parallel recursion for web

00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,870
services is this kind of a nice segue

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,700
off of ms tease previous comments about

00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:25,039
just keeping things simple when you're

00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,870
doing complicated things and i can't

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,570
emphasize that enough so these are

00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:32,510
lessons I learned from Elsa I talked at

00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:35,720
last year's UFC and Madison about Elsa

00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:37,100
it's a so kind of a and I I don't like

00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,929
to use the word big data anymore because

00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:42,140
it's so overused but do you know data

00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:43,789
warehousing giant amount of vlogs in one

00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,500
of the previous talks i mentioned that

00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:48,140
is something you can use either with

00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,899
there's no alternative to log stash and

00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,220
that's all written in perl and before I

00:29:50,899 --> 00:29:54,049
go any further I want to thank everyone

00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,429
here who has contributed many of the

00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:57,679
hundreds of modules that's made that

00:29:55,429 --> 00:30:00,230
possible I hope that it's been a good

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,870
application for those modules but to

00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,850
moose and plaque and everybody out there

00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,880
thank you so much for for what you've

00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,880
done

00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:13,909
and this is all GPL so if you're

00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:16,549
interested in helping please do on the

00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:19,099
google code site there so the major

00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:22,459
problem is scaling beyond simple load

00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:25,249
balancing so that's where if you're

00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:27,859
saying I've got a database and I need to

00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:30,499
fit a lot of data in it how many of you

00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:33,109
set a mysql cluster has anybody done

00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:35,200
that I tried to do that in 2003 I got it

00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:38,809
successfully working and it was not fun

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,669
it's much better now I'm sure but the

00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:42,349
overall idea really taught me an

00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:45,679
important lesson might be wrong about

00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:47,959
that and it goes go stay with Oracle or

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,349
even I use MongoDB a fair amount and

00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:53,719
it's the same there my my philosophy

00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:55,039
that I want to at least present for your

00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:57,049
consideration won't work in all

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,719
situations that sometimes it's better to

00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:02,419
take the data source and keep it close

00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:05,179
to the data and then put your services

00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:07,129
API on top of that so that that's it

00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:09,349
doesn't work in every situation but if

00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:11,179
it does i highly recommend doing that

00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:13,190
and doing the aggregation in the

00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:14,719
application layer because then you have

00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,519
these perfect little cookie cutters

00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:18,409
everywhere and you don't have to deal

00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:20,299
with things like master slave

00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:22,879
replication all that kind of stuff if

00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:24,769
you can at least at the the database

00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:26,419
layer then you get to do it in your code

00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:28,339
where you get to do the debugging where

00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:30,529
you get to control what goes where and

00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:32,329
if you get nothing else out of this talk

00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:34,759
that's what I really want to impress

00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:36,769
upon you you know and also the big

00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:39,369
problem is I owe workload and this would

00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:41,209
be true of any kind of high read/write

00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:43,009
situation so it doesn't matter whether

00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:44,989
it's event data or not anytime you've

00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:46,519
got a lot of data coming in and you need

00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:49,489
to distribute that load I think this is

00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:51,200
a good model so the big problem is if

00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:52,789
any one part of that breaks are you

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,929
going to be able to figure that out at

00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:59,599
3am at night and the system that I'm

00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:03,979
used a Nelson that I encourage others to

00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:05,809
use I think helps with that so one of

00:32:03,979 --> 00:32:07,279
the first things I did with basic

00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:09,320
scalability was just two parallel eyes

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,059
everything that's the the Hadoop style

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,769
where you just say well I'll throw a

00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:14,119
thousand pizza boxes at it and it'd all

00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:15,199
be great and when I run

00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:18,079
I'll run it on all of them at the same

00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:20,299
time and that's nice until you have more

00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,819
than one data center or until you have

00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:24,619
NAT in between data centers and then

00:32:22,819 --> 00:32:27,019
suddenly things get to be a little bit

00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:29,809
weird and you also have some limitations

00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:32,419
as far as the number of nodes so what I

00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:34,099
implemented was what I call parallel

00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:35,629
recursion if anybody knows the actual

00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:38,239
proper computer science term for this

00:32:35,629 --> 00:32:40,999
let me know after the talk or humiliate

00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:42,979
me by yelling it now but this is the

00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:44,539
best I could come up with for the for

00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:46,219
what I was trying to do with it and the

00:32:44,539 --> 00:32:49,699
key here is that on the diagram where

00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:52,609
you have these children those can be in

00:32:49,699 --> 00:32:54,859
in different data centers and nobody the

00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:56,749
search head here doesn't have to have

00:32:54,859 --> 00:33:00,409
any idea that anything two levels below

00:32:56,749 --> 00:33:01,819
it exists and the mid-level guys don't

00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:03,949
have any idea that the search head

00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:06,019
exists so the config never refers to any

00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:08,029
of them so there's no IP addresses to go

00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:09,319
looking through the code like MST was

00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:11,119
talking about to see what's broken

00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:13,159
because they were never configured in

00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:17,149
the first place everything is either a

00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:19,399
web server or a web client so each node

00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:21,139
has its media peers and you can see that

00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:23,359
because it's a true you're going to get

00:33:21,139 --> 00:33:25,129
login performance and the key here is

00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:27,109
that at every level it's a hundred

00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:28,489
percent rest in JSON that's the only

00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:30,409
protocol so if you're setting up

00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:33,499
firewalls for the box you need you know

00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:35,629
80 and 443 in port 20 22 and that's it

00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:37,219
you might need to admin the box but

00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:39,559
there's no database handles none of that

00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:42,559
all that stays on each box and that

00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:44,989
makes things so much easier so there's

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,099
removed so many points of failure when

00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:51,829
you're trying to figure out what goes

00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:53,359
where in an enterprise and here's the

00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,859
just a little bit of code to kind of get

00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:57,349
the idea so you see there's in any event

00:33:54,859 --> 00:33:59,809
HTTP requests in there but the basic

00:33:57,349 --> 00:34:02,659
idea is that if you are look if you are

00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:04,189
127 001 then you can run the local query

00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:05,989
otherwise you're going to recurse and

00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:08,299
send that to everybody you know and just

00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:10,249
kind of rebroadcast a query that comes

00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:12,230
in and when the results come back you

00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:13,609
aggregate those so you're not getting

00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,440
results for a thousand no it's your only

00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:18,589
aggregating the results for the notes

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,040
directly below you so it scales that's

00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:28,560
it

00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:30,810
I wasn't finished Jeff jeez so what I

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,640
want to say is all of you can support

00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:34,440
the pearl foundation individually if you

00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,150
go to pearl foundation org and click on

00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,220
the donate button I'd encourage you to

00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,270
sign up for a recurring donation if

00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,010
everybody who came to the conference

00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:42,270
signed up for twenty bucks a month it

00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,429
would be about a hundred thousand a year

00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:46,169
and think of what sort of things that

00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:48,330
could fund like more / 05 core

00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:49,740
maintenance new Probie m's like Steven

00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:59,630
was talking about and all sorts of great

00:34:49,740 --> 00:35:03,390
stuff so please donate thank you howdy

00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:07,890
I'm into games and I wanted to talk

00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:10,440
about a fallacy that I see programmers

00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:14,580
who are also in two games fall into

00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,580
again and again and which I quite

00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:20,430
suspect also affects anyone with a

00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:23,790
programmatic mindset who is passionate

00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:25,590
about a thing and loves to represent it

00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:30,150
in code which is not in itself a bad

00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:33,210
thing so this is a screenshot of the

00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:36,170
first complicated pearl based project

00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:39,270
that I wrote under my own power it is a

00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:41,700
adaptation with a curses you I for a

00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:44,220
obscure board game designed by Andy

00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:47,460
Looney called Martian chess which myott

00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:50,220
thank ya go ago Andy which the office

00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,230
that I worked in circa 2,000 likes to

00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,750
play a lot as you can see I had some fun

00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:57,390
with it it used a raw talent interface

00:35:54,750 --> 00:36:00,180
it had a chat window it had a cursor

00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:03,000
based piece pick up it was a lot of fun

00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:06,120
I said oh I really enjoyed this I want

00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,790
to do this a lot more so far so good so

00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,680
my next obvious target was a game design

00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:12,720
that I was playing around with myself

00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:17,340
for a game called currents this is a

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,050
archival photograph of it in play um so

00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,970
okay I started working on this and

00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:23,700
immediately I said we'll wait a minute

00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,440
this game has a board where Martian

00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,710
chess also had a board it would be

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,060
really inefficient for me to just to

00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,030
reprogram that I mean clearly I need to

00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,340
take a step back

00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:36,760
and make some sort of game board library

00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:39,220
but hang on not all game boards are

00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,080
square right they're not all chest face

00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,550
looking so I think I need to take a step

00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,500
back and you need to abstract this a

00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:47,710
little bit and maybe make a sort of more

00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,940
general game class now it's true that

00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,640
both of these games have four players

00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,050
but that's not true for all games and

00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,760
maybe not all player maybe they don't

00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,950
take turns I mean plenty of games are

00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,020
art earnest right or maybe you play in

00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:01,150
teams now I got to think about this some

00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:05,980
more so about six years passed and

00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:09,130
eventually we came to this so i had a

00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:10,840
startup called valla t and this was the

00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:14,140
front page of the website and we had a

00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:16,270
java client you could download and there

00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,950
were all these games some of which are

00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:21,190
licensed from other company some were

00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:22,930
developed in-house we had a dev blog and

00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,910
we had an RSS feed on the dev blog

00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:26,260
because we were so interesting and and

00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,910
we were sure that people didn't want to

00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:30,610
miss a single thing we had to say and we

00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:32,560
had wrote our own forum system and very

00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:35,860
very few people showed up to play these

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,780
games and and the startup went away and

00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:40,840
we're also can like look what did we do

00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:42,400
oh that's interesting um so a little bit

00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,830
of time passed I started playing around

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,540
with more online multiplayer games and

00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:48,910
started getting the console gaming I'm

00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,290
like oh well at playing xbox live is fun

00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,150
but you meet a lot of horrible people

00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:54,250
online there ought to be there happy

00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,600
some way like maybe I can put a pearl

00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,750
project to get this all done in Pearl by

00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:00,340
the way it's a sub topic um maybe I

00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,170
could I could throw a project Taylor

00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:04,750
that would allow you to like a you know

00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:06,070
meet the people online and so I know

00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,600
we'll make a giant website and we'll

00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:09,820
have a dead blob in the RSS feed and

00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,620
then and if you go to any of these

00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,270
websites right now this is what you see

00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,340
you see a fill-in beta said sorry these

00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:19,840
aren't here anymore this is room in

00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:21,370
catalyst by the way topic there's a box

00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,020
you can put your email address in i'm

00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,580
pretty sure that that's going somewhere

00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,599
but i've been so depressed by this whole

00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:31,559
thing i haven't actually looked at it

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,269
what where did I go wrong here um so in

00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:35,720
both of these cases what happened was

00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:39,029
there was a thing I wanted to make and

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:41,160
then I ended up saying wait I want to

00:38:39,029 --> 00:38:43,950
make this for the entire world what I

00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,140
was actually doing was my target was me

00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:48,390
and then I forgot that and then my

00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:51,569
target was a entire cornfield of strong

00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:53,069
men who are a crap user base the straw

00:38:51,569 --> 00:39:00,839
men will not come out of the cornfield

00:38:53,069 --> 00:39:04,019
and use your software so it turns out I

00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:05,519
can be taught my project in 2010 I

00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:06,960
really like old-school interactive

00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,089
fiction games I said I want to make one

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,799
of these myself years ago I would have

00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:12,539
said I know I'll write my own pearl back

00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:13,950
end with my own text parser because that

00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:15,269
can't be too hard and I'll write a Java

00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,489
Script front-end that like me doing my

00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:18,900
own special effects know what I did was

00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:20,519
I picked up a language called in form

00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,339
which is great and lets you publish to

00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,869
the web out of the box I wrote a game

00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:26,759
called the Warblers nest which I

00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:29,039
actually shipped it is now being foisted

00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:30,539
upon undergraduate students and digital

00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,430
humanities classes across the United

00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:33,569
States they hate it they send me hate

00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:41,430
mail and I think that's awesome because

00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:43,019
I wrote it for me but it was good enough

00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:45,779
that other people or other people are

00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:47,789
doing it anyway and it exists and that

00:39:45,779 --> 00:39:49,739
is awesome later on I got obsessed with

00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:51,059
rot13 I wanted to bring it to modern

00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:52,650
social networks I crapped out this

00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:55,259
catalyst application i wrote my own CSS

00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:57,089
in two weekends you can tell and here's

00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:58,440
people using on Twitter there's someone

00:39:57,089 --> 00:40:00,539
talking about the transformers cartoon

00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,219
that's someone talking about Doctor Who

00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:03,420
I guess that's me and friend talking

00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:05,069
about the Sean Carruth feel most room

00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,779
color which is very good and it's all in

00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,979
our rot13 and that's called spoiler

00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:11,670
riffic if you want to look at any your

00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:13,680
own time in conclusion please do write

00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,660
the programs that drive you follow your

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,829
passion just do not forget who you are

00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,829
writing it for thank you

00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:31,840
hi if you have your phone on please put

00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:34,810
it on vibrate after lightning talks are

00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,670
over we're going to go out of the

00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:39,490
auditorium there will be some Brown

00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:41,800
staff shirts which will guide you up the

00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:43,360
inner stairs and we will have buses that

00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,900
will take you directly over to the stage

00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:55,870
on sixth Street where gay night and the

00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:57,490
dinner banquet will begin all right

00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:02,110
today I'm going to be talking about XML

00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:05,950
and Pearl it's about mojo dumb I'm a

00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:07,600
module mojolicious in mojo dom mojo dom

00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:10,390
is a module available on the sea pan

00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,040
it's just part of mojolicious and the

00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,810
tagline of mojolicious is web

00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,750
development can be fun again there's a

00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:18,640
website we can use the module to

00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:25,080
traverse a dom document object model

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:27,520
tree so that's HTML XHTML XML whatever

00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:31,780
and I heard about it from a blog post by

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:33,280
Joel burger shout out to him and it's a

00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:39,550
good candidate for interacting with an

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:41,560
XML driven API in my case I used it for

00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:45,070
my first Sipan module web service Murph

00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:47,140
which is related to health care I'm

00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:49,270
gonna show you two examples first one is

00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,250
just parsing XML extracting values at

00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:54,160
our particular node particular nodes and

00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:58,750
then the other example is modifying

00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:01,270
those certain values in place so here's

00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:03,910
our first XML example I'm representing

00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:07,450
three music albums we've got the cds

00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:09,250
node nest with CD artist title year and

00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:15,190
i've got three albums here representing

00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:17,260
three decades 70s 80s 90s here's the the

00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:19,540
source code to we're going to parse

00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:22,630
through that xml and print out the three

00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:24,700
attributes the artist title in here you

00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,890
can see inside of the for each loop that

00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,630
we're going to iterate through its

00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:31,350
modular collection object and then we're

00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:34,390
with the printf i'm passing a list that

00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:36,550
using a CSS selector title artist year

00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:37,840
it's going to give us back a list and

00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,130
we're going to extract the text from

00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:43,630
each then we're going to report this

00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:45,280
size so live demo and I still have that

00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:47,710
mirror screens thing on that should

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,770
probably close that okay so it works

00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:57,430
found CD found CD found CD there's three

00:42:50,770 --> 00:43:01,420
CDs total okay um second example now

00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:04,060
it's the same thing okay this is a more

00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:09,340
complicated XML example in this case

00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:13,540
it's software configuration the

00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:15,430
important lines here are the this is

00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,540
idea of a channel in this piece of

00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:19,660
software and then the channel has

00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:22,120
something called the destination so the

00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,400
channel is called foo bar and the

00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,710
destination has two destinations to baz

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,090
and two cooks I don't know if I'm saying

00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:30,190
those medicine tactic variables

00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:32,860
correctly but I don't know if anyone

00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:34,870
knows the right pronunciation what I

00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,700
want to do here is there's also these

00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:39,090
enabled nodes which turns those

00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,620
destinations on or off in the software

00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:43,660
they have a boolean value and I want to

00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:48,190
change it from true to false in my case

00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:50,200
so here's the Pearl to do that I'll die

00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:53,220
sick this one a little more we read in

00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:56,080
the xml file make our Dom object again

00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:59,430
I've refactored the cut into subroutine

00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:03,340
so we're going to turn tux the cox one

00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:05,200
off and we're going to turn the other

00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,480
one button the Boz off and then we're

00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,980
going to turn back on and then we're

00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:13,210
going to look at the the difference

00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:16,360
between both in then diff I'm and the

00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:18,430
code before I did the demo here we can

00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,890
extract it here and see if it's enabled

00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:24,910
just looking at the enabled node you

00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:27,070
have to toggle it from on to off we can

00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:32,800
use the replace content method that mojo

00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:35,050
Dom provides live demo alright so first

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,430
we just read it in the Boz and they're

00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:41,400
both yes yes

00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:45,690
we turned the second one off we turned

00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,489
both of them off and we turned the

00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:50,369
second one back on but we left the first

00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:53,099
one off we called endif and sure enough

00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:55,430
that second one boss is when from true

00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:55,430
to false

00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:11,870
hi my name is Nick Melnick I am from a

00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:13,940
company outside of Minneapolis called

00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:15,920
digital river specifically a small

00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,050
division called my commerce we do

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,090
ecommerce small/medium businesses we run

00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:22,790
on a pearl stack catalyst tvix class

00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:24,560
mousse cool stuff some cooler stuff

00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:27,050
coming still trying to figure out how to

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,670
deal or not deal but really engage with

00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:30,860
the pro community especially in terms of

00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,840
money but we are looking for people soon

00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:34,820
both full-time and contractors both

00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:37,160
on-site and remote feel free to come

00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:48,130
find me meet me I'll buy you a beer and

00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:50,630
we can talk but thanks everyone hey hey

00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:53,120
actually hey hey means goodbye and

00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:54,590
Swedish they learned it when Carl masuk

00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,450
was talking on the phone to his family

00:45:54,590 --> 00:46:00,230
for a long time and then said hey hey

00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:02,830
and then put the phone down okay it

00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:06,320
means hello and goodbye well hey hey

00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:09,320
Thank You Carl who here is heard of the

00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,240
fizzbuzz algorithm okay quite a lot of

00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,770
you basically all it is it's something

00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,390
you might get an interview question its

00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,370
print the numbers 1 through 100 but if

00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:18,260
the number is divisible by 3 print phase

00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:20,270
divisible by 5 print buzz and if it's

00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:22,880
divisible by both 3 and 5 print fizzbuzz

00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:27,590
and so here's a purl one liner that does

00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:30,740
fizz both yeah okay pretty simple right

00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:36,820
okay so let me show you fizzbuzz in a

00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:36,820
different programming language now

00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:42,760
in the last 20 years this is the coolest

00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:45,340
program I ever saw and I saw it one day

00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:49,450
but I didn't think much of it but let's

00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:52,180
see if this actually runs so it's called

00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:54,370
snus snu SP and I'm going to run snuff

00:46:52,180 --> 00:47:00,180
on this example I'm called fizzbuzz

00:46:54,370 --> 00:47:06,220
that's nuts and yes it works okay so um

00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:13,570
what is snus well it's a it's it's a two

00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:15,190
dimensional brainfuck basically you have

00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:19,120
a program pointer that moves around

00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:21,850
either east west north or south and it

00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:24,700
bounced it only 10 of the characters in

00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:27,010
that file we're actual code these

00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:30,040
characters it will bounce off a

00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,240
reflector as you can see there's there's

00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,100
those two and then there's some

00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,490
registered shifters increment and

00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:38,320
decrement for a register and then read

00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:40,000
and write and then it has this little

00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,550
subroutine calling this was actually

00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,230
called modular snus you can do all of

00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:47,650
them with with just the first ones and

00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:53,140
then there's bloated snus that adds four

00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:54,700
more characters but that doesn't really

00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:57,730
tell you much about how the program

00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:59,590
works does it so let's actually watch

00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:01,120
the the programming executing you can

00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:03,390
actually has a debugger that comes with

00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,390
snus

00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:08,880
ok so the program starts at the dollar

00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:10,710
sign or it starts in the in the

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,180
northwest corner but this one has a

00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:14,190
dollar sign so you can see right there

00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:17,100
below the cursor that there is a dollar

00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:20,820
sign it started now this cursor is

00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:22,500
traveling to the east and but now I'm

00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,240
going to single step through this it's

00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,310
going to reflect off of this go up and

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,570
it gets basically up to here goes across

00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:30,150
all these no-op characters this

00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:33,750
documentation and then let's see what

00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:36,030
happens now I can speed this up and we

00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:37,680
can see that it's incrementing this

00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,330
register at up in the upper corner and

00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,790
it got to 66 that's a that's the

00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:44,280
character be so later it knows it's

00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:46,560
going to need to print a be so it's pre

00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,850
calculating all these now we can speed

00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:54,060
this up quite a bit get through the

00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:56,370
initialization phase and now it's

00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,600
calculating one to see if ok so we got

00:48:56,370 --> 00:49:02,900
one down at the bottom everybody see

00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:06,110
that there's two now we expect phys

00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:09,990
let's see if that works phys ok great

00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:12,000
and now we're in a little loop i want to

00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:13,620
show you this loop so i'm going to

00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,580
single step through this loop let's see

00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:19,860
the in the upper corner there's a

00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:22,170
register right here that has the square

00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:23,610
brackets around it and it's every time

00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:26,040
it hits that minus that register goes

00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:29,730
down to one so let's let's let it go for

00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:32,700
a little bit ok got it um well shoot

00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:34,850
alright so got to get into that loop

00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,850
again

00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:48,110
oh where am I at 42 okay and then I go

00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:52,520
now the question mark when it gets down

00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:56,900
to zero is going to skip over the next

00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:58,610
character and it'll keep running that's

00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:02,660
all i want to show you on that and it

00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:07,490
actually takes 150,000 steps to execute

00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:09,230
that fizzbuzz now what is this program

00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:10,550
written in and what was that interpreter

00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:12,440
well of course it's written in perl and

00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:14,360
the actual code that existed only

00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:17,330
existed on this ward cunningham wiki

00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,770
from 2004 there's the code for it right

00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:20,510
there and here's the debugger i took

00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:24,020
those two things and put them together

00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:25,400
and made a fizzbuzz on Sipan called

00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,410
language fizzbuzz you can check that out

00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,850
but where did I originally found this I

00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:31,250
found this on a site called rosetta code

00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:33,200
who's heard of rosetta code okay rosetta

00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:36,560
code matches 500 programming languages

00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,900
with 700 programming tasks and it's

00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:41,210
really cool and Perl 6 uses it all the

00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:43,180
time / 05 I I just found out uses it i

00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:45,500
added a language called test ml to it

00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:47,000
but the one problem is is that getting

00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,470
to code examples is hard and then you

00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,600
got to cut and paste them out so

00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:52,460
basically i wrote a perl script that

00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,900
turn the whole thing into a git

00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:58,000
repository so you can check it out from

00:50:53,900 --> 00:51:01,460
github and let's see what's in here a

00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,080
lot of code you can look at all the the

00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:04,490
code in five hundred languages at seven

00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,830
hundred programming test so I'm ever

00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:11,140
written and enjoy yourself and that's

00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:11,140
that's about it so

00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:25,100
oh and another thing one last thing hey

00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:26,750
hey okay so I heard some talk of I are

00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:32,150
seeing it warm my heart this is my first

00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:34,640
yep see but uh so how many of you have

00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:36,170
heard of F net and on IRC and how many

00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,600
of you remember when F net was fairly

00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:41,900
young and do you remember those fan

00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,700
finish guys so hi my name is Wampus and

00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:50,840
I created F net because the fens made me

00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:53,300
do it although I did quit IRC cold

00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,950
turkey on january first 1992 you can

00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:57,530
still talk to me about it and one last

00:51:54,950 --> 00:52:00,560
thing my ad so I'm up against Ricardo

00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:01,850
tomorrow at one-thirty p.m. he's going

00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,590
to be talking about the state of Perl 5

00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:05,000
porters and I'd actually replicate his

00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:07,220
session than mine but if you want to

00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,140
hear about a pearl startup come see me

00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:11,140
at one thirty tomorrow thanks

00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:25,850
alas poor CGI p.m. I knew him Horatio

00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:28,010
I'm parent Harkins I work for we also

00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:34,220
walked dogs and I'm here to bid a fond

00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:36,500
farewell to CGI p.m. listen I I have I

00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:38,750
admit I have bashed CGI p.m. plenty of

00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:42,500
times and I wouldn't recommend anybody

00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:44,420
use it for new code today and I won't

00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:49,400
even argue about it being removed from

00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:54,050
the core but many of the people in this

00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:59,740
room are here for in one way or another

00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:59,740
because of Lincoln Stein and CGI p.m.

00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:12,480
so Lincoln took the Pearl for cgi lib PL

00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:14,480
and replaced it with a nice profile

00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,530
module with lots of bells and whistles

00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:21,240
and it's hard to appreciate it now what

00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:24,660
a big deal this was for Pearl at the

00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:27,420
time everybody wanted to put their stuff

00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:30,359
on the web and thanks to CGI p.m. Pearl

00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:32,520
was the fastest easiest way to do it and

00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:35,760
pro got a whole new user base out of

00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:39,800
that and became inextricably linked with

00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:43,230
web development for better or worse and

00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:47,250
there was a lot of help learning CGI

00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:50,670
thanks to the enormous pearl dock that

00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:52,680
came with the CGI module in fact this

00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:56,609
was so comprehensive that it was

00:53:52,680 --> 00:54:01,349
published as a book seriously this book

00:53:56,609 --> 00:54:02,730
is like basically the pod and you know

00:54:01,349 --> 00:54:05,040
you can see the title here official

00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:06,810
guide to programming with CGI p.m. the

00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,570
standard for building web scripts and

00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:11,730
it's not really an exaggeration this was

00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:15,210
probably your best guide to learning CGI

00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:21,530
in any language at that time the RFC for

00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:25,800
CGI was written later so besides the

00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:28,560
historical significance of this there's

00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,330
also it's worth noting a couple of cool

00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,800
features that CGI brought which are

00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:36,780
which are now pretty much taken for

00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:38,310
granted one thing was CGI carp you

00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,349
didn't have to flip over to your

00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:43,020
terminal anymore and look in the in the

00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:44,730
error log now you could actually see the

00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:49,080
messages right in your browser that was

00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:52,020
a huge time-saver was amazing it also

00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:53,970
had a command-line interface so you

00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:55,890
could test your code right the command

00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:58,890
line you could even write programs which

00:54:55,890 --> 00:55:01,140
would work in a CGI environment and a

00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:05,070
command line environment which was also

00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:09,150
pretty awesome when Doug McKettrick came

00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:11,130
along with mod perl cgi p.m. was adapted

00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:13,650
so that you could run the same code

00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:16,619
under mod perl without modification or

00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,869
if you had not used lexical variables

00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:20,079
with

00:55:16,869 --> 00:55:21,519
a lot of modification and then with a

00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:25,599
few lines of code you could run it under

00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:28,119
fast CGI as well so basically a CGI p.m.

00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:32,490
was the the first sort of abstraction

00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:32,490
layer for web environments in Perl

00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:39,880
there's also I mean I know the code is

00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:41,650
ugly and if I was working on a project

00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:46,930
where if somebody was writing code like

00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:50,559
this I would be sad but as a portal new

00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:53,769
be looking at this stuff we basically he

00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:57,249
takes a pile of strings autoload and

00:55:53,769 --> 00:56:00,579
eval and generates an entire procedural

00:55:57,249 --> 00:56:03,549
and object-oriented interface it's

00:56:00,579 --> 00:56:05,920
pretty amazing and it really opened my

00:56:03,549 --> 00:56:12,730
eyes to what what you could do with

00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:14,859
pearl and how flexible it was so it

00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:19,269
looks like it may be time for CGI p.m.

00:56:14,859 --> 00:56:23,079
to leave this pearl core and you know go

00:56:19,269 --> 00:56:25,960
join bilbo and frodo on the boat head to

00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:30,640
the Elven lands but let's just take a

00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:34,710
second to thank cgi p.m. for all it's

00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,710
done for us rest well old friend

00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:48,770
wow there's a lot of people out here hi

00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:51,500
I'm Andrew Graham guard I run your Los

00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:53,180
Angeles bow mongers I say you're because

00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,770
you are welcome to come visit in fact

00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:57,950
when you come visit you're welcome to

00:56:54,770 --> 00:57:00,170
talk so if any of you find yourselves

00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:04,190
passing through away for I don't know a

00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:07,160
lay over an hour to whatever I call us

00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:09,500
up like we are used phones I a mess up

00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:11,720
and we'll move the meeting around and

00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:14,330
you can come talk and your talk can be

00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:16,190
named like our most recent blah blah

00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:19,040
blah you probably won't learn anything

00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:23,270
from this and we will still sit in rapt

00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:26,000
attention that may only apply to mjd all

00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:29,690
right again please come and if you're

00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,640
looking to work there pearl la should

00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:36,670
have some of the companies in the area

00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:36,670
that might hire you so go for it and

00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:44,990
that brings us to the end of the second

00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:47,020
day of lightning talks there's still one

00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:47,020
more

00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:56,080
still one more round tomorrow before

00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:58,630
everyone leaves if you're giving a

00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,580
lightning talk tomorrow most of them

00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:03,880
have been accepted already the orders

00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:05,800
not set but before the session the

00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:08,230
closing keynote please come sit in the

00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,360
front to keep things speed it along we

00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:11,980
did fairly well today we started seven

00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:17,140
minutes late we finished seven minutes

00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:20,050
late I kept my ground so that's it for

00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:23,220
tonight now up the ramp follow the brown

00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:23,220
