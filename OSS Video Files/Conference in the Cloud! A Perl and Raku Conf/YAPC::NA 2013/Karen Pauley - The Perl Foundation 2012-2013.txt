okay good afternoon I think it's

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:09,360
probably about time to start yes okay

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,980
thank you I'm sorry I'm really amused

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,969
this scream it's in front of me that

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,150
shows me my slides because I'm kind of

00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:19,770
you know sure that's been appealing to

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,920
my sense of humor lot of peering at you

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,500
over it I'll be fine and good afternoon

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,380
my name is Karen Pauly I am the current

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,240
president of the pro point ition I'm

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,369
going to do a short talk it's 20 minutes

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,540
i'm gonna do a brief review of some of

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,280
the things we've been doing in the past

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,950
year and a little bit of the history of

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:44,640
who we are can everybody hear me ok i

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:47,789
think ok ok that's wonderful ok thank

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,110
you ok so the pearl foundation is a

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:55,140
non-profit and we at the minute we have

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,579
about 50 volunteers I think we'd about

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,500
50 volunteers last year I was actually

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,109
hoping during the year that we would

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,239
increase the number of volunteers but i

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,970
suppose what happens is some volunteers

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,820
leave when we get new ones mrs. one of

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,260
our volunteer this is downright he is

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,090
the current treasurer of the pearl

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,159
foundation so one of the interesting

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,700
things about running a non-profit with

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,350
only volunteers is it there's an awful

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,590
lot of time that people are expected to

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,119
spend so when i say i would like to

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,310
increase the number of volunteers me

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,720
currently a 50 when someone new comes to

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,610
me and says hey I would like to join

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,369
it's actually very hard for me to work

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,710
out how much time you need to spend so

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,810
damn is a good picture of down because i

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,780
think his rule is quite difficult down

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,369
as the treasurer of the pearl foundation

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,899
anybody here he's involved in any sort

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,119
of open source project that you're doing

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,640
in your spare time it's really good if

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,340
you can set your own deadlines but

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,860
because down is the treasurer he has to

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,270
follow other people's deadlines so he's

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,549
got quite a difficult rule and I'm very

00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:01,140
appreciative what he's doing but I don't

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:04,259
think he's here thank you so during the

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,850
last year our conferences chair step

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,409
down George McAdams and we got a new one

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,229
Heath so Heath you've probably seen

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,330
around the conference and he is here so

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,420
the pro foundation was as I said in the

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,610
first morning

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,860
it was created back in the year 2000 and

00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:21,130
it was created by a group of people who

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,599
are attending AFC North America so the

00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,980
very first thing with the Perla

00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,860
foundation was set up to do was wrong

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:29,819
conferences and at the minute we are

00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:33,670
still running yop see North America so

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:35,350
he and a group of volunteers decide

00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,400
where the new value is going to be and

00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,959
try to help I'd the current organizers

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,849
so the goal of the pearl foundation is

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,790
simply to support the pearl kinoti i

00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:47,230
know that in some ways that's quite

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,480
vague but we try to support whatever

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,890
projects are important to people at the

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,620
time and the things that people get in

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,840
touch with me about and one of the

00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:00,850
things that we do every year is look at

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,709
grants so this is alberto and he runs

00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,060
our grants committee and this is a

00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:05,970
picture of him last year we were to

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,860
conference this is yap see Europe in

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,569
Frankfurt which was so hot it was hotter

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,489
than this particular conference because

00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:14,470
there was no air conditioner with

00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:15,880
similar temperatures outside so he's

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,060
clinging on to that fan and the hope

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,280
that he can hold on it's a minute we

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,780
have to running grunts they are brand

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,060
new so I can't tell you anything about

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:30,190
them they were announced on our website

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:32,230
just in the last week we also provide

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,840
funding for some aspects of pearl six

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,000
and in the minute there's an ongoing

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,750
ground with Carl and one with Patrick

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,790
Mitchell so we whole separate funds of

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,880
money that we've raised for perl 6 and 4

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,980
pearl 5 and we also have a general fund

00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,019
so those first two grand scheme from our

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:55,180
general fund this is how much is left in

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:58,299
the current Perl 6 front and to be

00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:01,930
honest that's exactly the same figure it

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:04,480
was all my slide last year so we haven't

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,940
had any new requests for perl 6 grams in

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,609
the past year we may actually even have

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,620
some extra money because today i just

00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:13,329
closed one of the historic Perl 6 grants

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,389
that didn't require the complete amount

00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:19,810
of funding as well as the funding for a

00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:22,120
Perl 6 we have funding for pro 5 the

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:26,690
profile or maintenance fund is our most

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,250
recent fund and it was set up in

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,800
thousand eleven the first time I domani

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,050
went to Nicholas Clarke in august of

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,940
2011 again it was one of those things

00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:39,650
that we online study up see North

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:42,140
America we historically we had got money

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:45,260
from booking.com so that d of Mitchell

00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,520
was working on Pearl five bucks and that

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,860
money of course money wrong side it was

00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,810
fifty thousand and then we wanted to

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:55,640
have more of the mentiras able to work

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:59,530
so we raised money and since August 2011

00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:02,330
we have given 120,000 to nick clark

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,030
35,000 the d of mitchell 10,000 de paul

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,380
johnson champ thoresen to jess and a

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,760
smaller mind direct so he could travel

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:12,260
to the QA hackathon I'm incredibly

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,180
impressed that we were able to raise so

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,220
much money to fund them we are

00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,990
continuing to fund them currently that

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,910
fund has ninety five thousand or so left

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,440
which is it's a good amount of money we

00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:27,410
are expecting I don't know if any of

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:30,040
these follow our blog and you stop roll

00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,169
foundation the Lord we have a

00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,500
application of the minute from Tony cook

00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:38,480
to also work on the pro five core and

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,669
I'm expecting a new grant application

00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,190
from d of Mitchell and another one from

00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:44,810
Nicholas Clarke but even when those

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,020
grant applications came in is still

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,580
going to be some money left in this fund

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,470
when this fund we will have to look at

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,940
additional fundraising but I'll be

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:57,470
honest we have been fundraising very

00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:59,300
hard for this fund because we don't if I

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,590
go to people and try to raise lots of

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,919
money and then it sits in our bank

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,720
account for a year you know people want

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,070
to know I mean some of our sponsors will

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,010
say to me what exactly was my money

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:12,440
spent on and when was it spent so the

00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:14,030
pearl five people have been speaking to

00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,620
we're concerned because there is still

00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:19,400
this is still to me a substantial I

00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:23,810
might laugh or pro-life but it may well

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:26,060
be finished by the end of this year you

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,640
can donate to the profile fund or any of

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,200
the funds that we have on our website we

00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,120
have set up recurrent donations for

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,220
community members so it's not just large

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,560
sponsors like booking.com on craigslist

00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,419
they are supporting the pearl foundation

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,960
we also have community members who make

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:47,699
recurrent monthly donations

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:51,090
which is great this yeah I believe that

00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:54,030
we do we have only in the past year

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:57,000
helped one that I know of so the

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,860
companies if your company does that they

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,930
usually sounds a piece of paper to dan

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,120
and I know he has soared out one this

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,910
year so I believe that we do the issue

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,560
with company matches is that whilst I

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,840
keep talking about the pearl foundation

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,349
this organization was formed as yet

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,759
another society so a lot of people have

00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,099
come to me about their company schemes

00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,470
even my own husband it couldn't find the

00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:24,030
pearl foundation because we're listed as

00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:30,419
yet another society which is our legal

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:32,759
name we have we registered the name the

00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:48,770
pro foundation and I mean we tree it

00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:51,270
onto the pearl foundation in general yes

00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,620
yes in general yes I mean there are

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,389
things that people come to me that we

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,889
don't have money for we have a huge

00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,050
foundation I mean this is a completely

00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,639
volunteer organization it's made up of

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,099
people from this Community who none of

00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,530
them were professional fundraisers but

00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:06,509
you know if somebody has a great idea we

00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,330
really do try to work the fondant and

00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:11,759
Nicholas Clarke came to me actually in

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,590
2011 it wasn't me they come up with the

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,560
promo five core idea I mean we had

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:18,090
funding I was it was people in p5p and

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,590
we got together me so how can we do this

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,330
how can we raise money where are we

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,699
getting the money for Nicholas Clarke to

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,199
work you know for months and because the

00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,639
community responded and because the

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,610
companies responded we did really well

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,370
because people obviously want to see

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,020
change there so yeah I'm all for good

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:39,479
ideas and grant requests if we don't

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:42,750
have the money well we can try so one of

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,240
the things that we've done this year was

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,730
to take part in the outreach program for

00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:52,540
women so

00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:54,100
we have him in we're in the past we took

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,829
part in G sock which I send most people

00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:00,370
have heard of the google summer of code

00:08:55,829 --> 00:09:03,130
and and it's I mean it's a wonderful

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,690
program but in the past year we didn't

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,570
manage to get in fact this is the second

00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:23,410
year that we're not taking part and it

00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:27,130
takes well yes yes so Jude he's sitting

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:29,589
back there sleeping and he put in that

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,570
really is to keep sorry I'm so dull

00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:33,970
today he put in the application for the

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,529
parent foundation and he accepted three

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,380
students one of which is indeed working

00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:41,230
on pearl but the pearl foundation itself

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,600
usually sets its own application in last

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,610
year we had a really good application I

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,079
was a lot of work by the community we

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,570
didn't get accepted because it's a

00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:50,350
really big program there were many

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,420
basically when we asked them they said

00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,680
well there were just many applicants

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,690
it's not that your application was

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,660
terrible this year to be honest we

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:00,670
didn't have the energy we really didn't

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,470
I mean I contacted everyone who'd been

00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,269
involved this is difficult if you're a

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,800
volunteer and you spent hours of your

00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:08,079
time trying to get India program last

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,930
year and i write to you and say hey come

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:14,230
try this g sock thing again it it's

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:17,040
tough so this year we really did our

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,240
volunteers really ran out of time

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,339
earlier on in the year people have

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,050
talked about this program so the art

00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:25,029
wage program for women was set up by the

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,769
genome foundation because they notice

00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:29,380
that not that many women apply to JSOC

00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:30,850
and there'll be a really good idea to

00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,920
have an internship program that really

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,860
encouraged women to take part in open

00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,019
source I thought it'd be a fantastic

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,089
idea to do it and it is it's a great

00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:41,740
idea and we got funding for one intern

00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:44,410
so we were able to find five thousand

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,170
dollars for one intern and I started

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,760
working on the program but because none

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,730
of the people with experience and

00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,730
programs like G so could help me it was

00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:57,730
a lot of work and it is so all of these

00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,160
um and I discovered how difficult it is

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,850
to actually run a program that has hard

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,079
deadlines that are outside my control

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,189
whenever I find out that the volunteer

00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,050
if he was supposed to run the program

00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:10,810
couldn't it was two weeks before it

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:14,350
started and I was going to China on

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,819
holiday on a boat so I started trying to

00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,490
do this work because people were joking

00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:21,639
with me on a slow boat to China using

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,560
satellite internet it was interesting no

00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,180
no that we have done the program once if

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,069
I can raise the money I'm hoping we can

00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,750
continue to take part because this is a

00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:34,870
great program we got four applications

00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:37,509
two of them were for dancer one was for

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:42,040
meta Sipan and the one that was accepted

00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:43,420
was for moose all four women contribute

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,920
to the project we're still trying to

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,829
encourage them to keep contributing to

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,290
the project Pisano who's working almost

00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:52,180
is going to be working myths for a

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:56,259
period of three months for 40 hours a

00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:58,149
week thus that's a big contribution and

00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:00,399
for that she gets this internship with

00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:01,600
five thousand dollars and actually one

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,600
of the problems with the size of that

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,449
time contribution is it all our projects

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,779
are full of volunteers and we don't have

00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:12,790
a strong set of mentors who have that

00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,639
amount of time to dedicate to a newcomer

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,589
on their project and that is something

00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:19,899
I'm hoping over the next year we can

00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:21,879
address and Duke was saying yesterday

00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:23,980
about wanting to do something like the

00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:27,009
google Summer of Code you know for

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,170
pearls was he calling at seasons of yeah

00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:31,000
yeah he was talking about doing

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,439
something like that I would love us to

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,269
do something like that but for me the

00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:36,250
challenge is not necessarily going to be

00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:39,750
raising the money for it it's going to

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:42,040
be having rules and help for our mentors

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,750
you know I wrote to lots of people in

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,579
the community to ask for help with this

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,160
program and a lot of them go back and

00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:50,110
said we would love to take part but we

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,519
on have people with the time to deal

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,759
with someone who's sending he's working

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,230
40 hours a week full-time on our project

00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,089
but I think we can improve on that I

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,420
think we can come up with some sort of

00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:03,279
educational program and some sort of you

00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,800
know that there has to be a way to

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,980
encourage mentorship in the community it

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,509
really does so I'm very hopeful that we

00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:14,679
can continue with this particular

00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:15,490
program in the past year so the pearl

00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:17,980
foundation

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,149
is a whole set of committees and also

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,589
it's all rather dull so we have a

00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:22,420
conference committee we've got grants

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:23,980
committees we have a fundraising

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,500
committee if anybody's interested in

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,730
joining the fundraising committee

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,140
because remember I said I had 50

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,930
volunteers do you know how many of them

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:36,160
are on the fundraising committee give me

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:38,680
guess well this me because our Charter

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,930
states that a board member has to be on

00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,640
a committee you know so yeah we don't

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,320
have any we created the committee

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,560
because um I thought it'd be a great

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,390
idea but obviously the feeling there as

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,470
well as an us publicizing that we need

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:53,020
more volunteers for some of these

00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:57,089
committees I understand that but yes so

00:13:53,020 --> 00:14:07,720
we've a fundraising committee but I

00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:10,510
absolutely I and the feeling I know and

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,010
there is no diet that the feeling

00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,899
because yesterday I did say that the

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,250
feeling is within us and our management

00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:18,490
as well because we are a set of

00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:20,740
volunteers and sometimes instead of

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,899
creating vision and doing new things we

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,060
spend all our time fighting fires and

00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:26,380
dealing with historic things you may I

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,890
spend a lot of time working on the

00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:32,500
profound issue and I don't work full

00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:35,260
time so I'm able to spend I try to spam

00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,790
between 10 to 20 hours a week but at

00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,380
times it's just not enough time and I do

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,230
spend an awful lot of time dealing with

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,910
community issues mediating arguments

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,070
between people and various parts of our

00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:47,470
community all things that you're

00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,050
probably not expecting me to do but my

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,690
email is full of you know community

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:55,180
issues and that's fine and actually

00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,130
that's why we created this is our newest

00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,630
committee this is the community advocacy

00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,600
committee so someone else can deal with

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:04,149
those community issues instead and that

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,760
yakov has started to do that now his

00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:09,610
committee is very new these are the the

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,950
gold that he has and I can assure you

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,660
that he has not got very far yet in

00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,610
achieving them one of the things he's

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:19,480
planning and doing over the next year is

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:21,190
holding an event and each quarter and to

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,079
try and bring together members of the

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,959
community to discuss community issues

00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:28,120
not the discuss technical things we

00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,760
already have quite a few workshops there

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:34,150
are the concept of encouraging leaders

00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,740
of perl mongers groups and she actually

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:38,500
just build bridges and they community

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,450
this is I have had people get in touch

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,390
me they talk about the Pearl community

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:45,520
and I keep calling it the mythical pearl

00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:48,040
community because the pearl community

00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,750
room I live in Tokyo and Tokyo is the

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,430
biggest city in the world by lots of

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:54,430
different measures but it is not a city

00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:56,110
it's 23 cities all joined together you

00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:57,790
know it's got all its own cultures and

00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,520
all its own places to go to there's no

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:03,760
downtime Tokyo and the pearl communities

00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,460
not just one huge agreeing group of

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:10,060
people it's many many communities who

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,230
all use pearl but who are very different

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,250
cultures and people don't necessarily

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:17,500
get on so we don't even build bridges

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:19,420
between our own communities and I think

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,740
it's quite important that we look at

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,740
that and that's something that y'all go

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,970
wants to work on he created his own logo

00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,120
because we have to have yet another

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,680
onion this is actually an onion flora

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,650
being told up until the onion is not

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:37,510
very pretty logo so he went for his own

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,220
last year for the first time so the

00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:42,339
pearl foundation was created in the year

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,800
2000 and the first time we created

00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:48,310
anything professional imprinting was

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,900
this year so we actually managed a

00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,520
professional end-of-year report I have

00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,790
copies of what if anybody wants to see

00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,440
it and we are hoping this year we're

00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:59,080
currently working on a sponsorship

00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,120
perspective for fundraising something

00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,680
that we've never had so one of the

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,510
issues if you want to get involved in

00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,250
something like fundraising because we

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,959
don't do a lot of it I don't know how

00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,189
long it's going to take I don't know the

00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,800
best approach you should take and I

00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:13,929
don't even have material to give you to

00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,660
tick so the minute we're working on

00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:18,670
creating these sorts of materials and

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,839

contacted by a group of people in

00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,760
