so my name is tsunami you might have

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:08,790
seen me on stack overflow in action

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:13,080
times I haven't ooh I haven't been there

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:17,100
in a while but in a previous life I used

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:21,210
to teach economics to undergrad students

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:26,070
but even way before then sometime around

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:29,939
the 80s maybe 1981 I fell in love with

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,890
computers so from that point on from the

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,030
end of grade school to the end of high

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:42,120
school I wanted to have something to do

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:44,160
with computers in my life and 1982 my

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,260
mother and my great aunt helped me get

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,629
my hands on a ZX Spectrum I had been

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,079
playing with the zx81 before before then

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,879
I was writing pencil and paper programs

00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,239
then came the end of high school in

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,309
Turkey at the time where I grew up the

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,910
college you went to was determined by a

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,470
two-stage central exam that is you

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,420
didn't apply to colleges you just took

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,820
one exam if you pass that you were

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,860
entitled to take the second exam during

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,939
which your placement was determined I

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,960
was filling in my preferences computer

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,830
science computer science computer

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,270
science Electrical Engineering

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,630
Electrical Engineering Electrical

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,150
Engineering you had like room 436

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,799
preferences i ran out at that 20 or

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,860
something my mother wanted me to go to

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,720
business i hated business i said okay

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,600
i'll make your trade my my 21st

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,210
preference will be economics unbeknownst

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,829
to me at the time i was also having

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,290
problems with my appendix Thank You of

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:47,189
sayings just tummy aches and i left the

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,649
exam early after doing only the math

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,659
questions now all those engineering

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,030
departments I had written took with a

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,240
took students with a combination of math

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,460
and science and of course in those areas

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,439
people who do well in math tend to do

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,990
well in unsigned stayed on two hundred

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,110
percent in math and 0 in sign so I can

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,420
get into any of the engineering ones but

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,840
the economics department that I wrote in

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,260
their middle east technical university

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,470
was actually taking students with a

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:20,750
combination of math and social studies

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,250
and there you have the inverse

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,040
correlation people who did really well

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,750
in math usually didn't do that well and

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,120
the social studies people who did really

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,459
well in social studies didn't really do

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,950
that well in math to top it all off

00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:35,599
people who do really well in math tend

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,420
to be in a minority so I ended up

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,459
getting there getting accepted there or

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:45,230
being admitted there as my 21st choice

00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:48,799
among you know one of the top scoring

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:51,260
people now back then you didn't have

00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:53,510
many choices for trying again in Turkey

00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,060
so I was convinced to give it a shot for

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,760
a year it turned out to be a great thing

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,500
I fell in love with economics as well

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,269
and the fact that I have been tinkering

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,849
with computers all up to that point was

00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:08,569
really helpful because they had these

00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:10,549
brand spanking new IBM pcs and somebody

00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:14,209
needed to write some Fortran or Pascal

00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:17,329
or do some spreadsheets stuff lo and

00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:20,030
behold fast forward to 2009 and uh

00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,700
teaching economics I was starting to get

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,430
a little tired so I'm back in the land

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:29,630
of computers never really left it but

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:32,660
now I'm doing it more as my sole purpose

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,430
in life but sometimes I run into

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,650
situations where a little bit of

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,230
economic knowledge would really help

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,090
programmers deal with what they're

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,400
dealing with so this talk was motivated

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,700
by a couple of blog posts i saw on

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,470
occasion and they kind of you know those

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,180
are John meetings that are supposed to

00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,280
be stand up but everybody sitting around

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,169
in a couch where everybody's supposed to

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,060
be telling people what they're doing but

00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:57,440
they're just mumbling stuff where

00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,000
everybody what he's supposed to be

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,829
talking about what's blocking them but

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,260
they're just really making up you know

00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:05,209
okay this is why I can't move on kind of

00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,010
stuff after a few too many of those

00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:09,500
kinds of meetings I thought maybe you

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:13,160
know sort of talking a little bit about

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:15,500
basic economic concepts might might open

00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,410
the floor for for more interesting sort

00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,359
of reflective kind of discussion and the

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,150
one thing when I was teaching economics

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,790
that I saw

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,560
is a lot of people who are who are

00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,030
really smart take just one economics

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,550
class in college and they're done with

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,940
it one of the reasons for that is your

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:36,880
econ 101 kind of class tends to be

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:40,620
extremely year towards the lowest common

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,120
denominator and again as my experience

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,330
shows me the lowest common denominator

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,340
in intro college classes tend to get

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:52,150
confused if there's a decimal point in a

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:55,900
division involved anywhere so when

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,460
you're geared towards that really smart

00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,380
people to not they say oh there's a

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,780
couple of straight lines couple

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,639
equations with a couple of variables I

00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,560
can do this in my sleep and there's

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,110
really nothing not much to it and they

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,139
move on but there's much more to the

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,630
basic stuff I'm gonna later on give an

00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:17,470
example of a question that was asked to

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:20,110
a couple of hundred PhD economics PhDs

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,330
from top programs in the United States

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,949
this is the kind of thing that you know

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:27,099
one would really include it in an

00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:28,330
in-class quiz you know five-minute quiz

00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:30,280
at the end of class here's a question

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,590
was the correct answer to people who are

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,599
taking economics for the first time but

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,699
eighty percent of these economics phd's

00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:38,770
failed to answered correctly so there's

00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:42,820
much more than the actual arithmetic

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,500
that goes into to economics a lot of

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,110
people who teach economics come to

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,880
economics not from undergrad but they

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,220
come to it because they are really smart

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,289
mathematically capable and to do grad

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,510
level study in economics you need to be

00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:57,159
mathematically very very capable but

00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,570
they've never thought about what goes in

00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:00,880
the background goes on in the background

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,610
they specialize in in grad school and

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,220
either solving stuff or running large

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:10,570
regressions or stuff like that and then

00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:14,770
they tend to ignore the basics so what's

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:16,330
economics and I'm not you know trying to

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,220
start a big debate here or anything but

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,860
I'm going to ignore a whole swath of

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,050
economics that that solely exists to

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:27,340
provide people with stable jobs in the

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,349
in the government sector um that's the

00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:32,289
macro stuff what is the right interest

00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:33,880
rate I don't know nobody does but you

00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:34,729
have to write those reports or somebody

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,289
in the government will

00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:41,659
pay you because what the politicians

00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:44,599
want to do is as to how a few people

00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:46,969
tell them x % is the right Federal

00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:48,469
Reserve interest rate and if you don't

00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:50,120
do that all hell is going to break loose

00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:52,669
the other guys have their own team of

00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:58,520
economists and they do battle that's my

00:06:52,669 --> 00:07:01,789
sort of jaded look at macroeconomics

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:06,379
there is a little transcription of a

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:09,620
NeoGraft party post power parity article

00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:11,719
that that we my friends and I fell in

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,029
love with in sometime in mid nineteen

00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:17,479
ninety-five which talks about why our

00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:19,999
macro guys so grumpy you know just mmm

00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,889
macro guys and I don't get along so but

00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:24,529
if you search for a wire macro guys so

00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:27,710
grumpy you'll see why anyway economics

00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:30,770
is constrained optimization what does

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:34,759
constrained optimization mean well you

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:37,999
want stuff to get stuff you do to you

00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:40,189
need to do things things have cost you

00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:42,259
have finite amount of resources you can

00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:44,779
allocate to doing things to get the

00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,159
stuff that you want so therefore you

00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:49,279
need to choose the best way of doing

00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:56,509
things this is where the usual you know

00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:58,520
I usual rant about what the Economist

00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:01,279
mean by best and what engineers mean by

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,639
best come into play because the conflict

00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,189
lies in the fact that the best is not

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,099
globally defined that's basically the

00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:12,349
whole tug of war within you know Marxist

00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:14,779
and the rest of us they have the labor

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:16,279
theory of value they think the value of

00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:18,800
everything can be figured out by the

00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,809
amount of labor that went into it no

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,759
matter how many iterations of investment

00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:24,620
that such has happened and therefore

00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,770
everything has an objective value the

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,839
stupid walk watch has objective value

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:33,169
whether the plastic cup according to

00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:35,620
them has objective value but for the

00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:38,149
rest of us nothing has objective value

00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:41,269
the value of everything is in the eye of

00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:43,229
the beholder yes

00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:45,180
optimization it sort of seems like if

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:49,230
there were no constraints you can't

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:51,630
optimize no you can't that's the other

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:55,259
thing I'm going to get it usually when

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:57,600
you look at tech discussions you see the

00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:01,410
word used you see the word optimized

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,560
used I but you see no constraints and

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,569
optimized REM means generally as fast as

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,870
possible or as small as possible but the

00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:11,940
actual objective is not satisfied

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:15,509
presented the proper way of putting that

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:18,180
would be as fast as possible while still

00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:19,980
keeping my electricity bills at this my

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,019
cooling requirements of this and the

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,759
cost of constructing that you know so

00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,769
there there needs to be if you're going

00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,889
to optimize there needs to be some kind

00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:30,569
of constraint sure there are functions

00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:32,490
with global Optima and all of that stuff

00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:33,630
but the interesting optimization problem

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,829
is when you have constraints because

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,610
when you have constraints you have

00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:41,040
trade-offs and again which trade-offs

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,649
are preferable when and where depends on

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:49,260
the conditions as well as who's making

00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:50,910
the decision in you know if you're

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,680
building a road in Nepal this is the

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,380
exact this is an example by one of my

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,470
favorite professors Robert Frank if you

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,240
ever feel curious and you have access to

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,269
JSTOR or something search for an article

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,120
called if Homo economicus could choose

00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,740
would he choose a utility function with

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,000
a conscience that's one of the things

00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,069
that actually convinced me that

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,480
economics was actually much more

00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:17,430
interesting than i have previously

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,959
thought the trade-offs involved while

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,180
you're you know when you're building a

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,399
road in nepal are different than the

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,589
trade-offs involved while you know if

00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,420
you're building a road in Pennsylvania

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:29,220
it feels like road construction in

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,130
Pennsylvania never ends the same strip

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,430
of Road always has the same barrels in

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,139
regardless of season yes whereas in

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:43,189
Nepal they actually do build the roads

00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:46,380
up eventually so trade-offs come from a

00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:50,040
confluence of or coming together of

00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:54,389
constraints and objectives an objective

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:57,759
I'm using that loose word here

00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:59,860
the universal objective in economics is

00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,660
to maximize the net benefit maximize the

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,970
difference between the total benefit you

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:07,000
get from something and the total cost of

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:09,790
doing something everybody does this it's

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,980
not an evil capitalist thing that's what

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:16,209
a lot of people get hung up on the word

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:17,560
for this is the word for this as we're

00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:21,279
going to see in a second the word for

00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,689
this is profit the value you drive from

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,939
the difference between the value you

00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:27,339
drive from doing something and the cost

00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:30,910
of doing it is profit and everybody

00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:33,220
maximizes profit nobody says I am

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,680
purposefully trying to get the least

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:38,709
amount of what I want at the most

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,829
possible cost everybody says I am trying

00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:44,379
to get the most of what I want at the

00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:46,029
least possible cost to me well you know

00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:48,850
leave aside the meanings of those words

00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:50,829
but you know in common language nobody

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:56,310
will say I'm trying to pay the most for

00:11:50,829 --> 00:12:00,699
the least where do constraints come from

00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:02,740
they come from things that are outside

00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:04,509
of us and things that are inside of us

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,170
so when I'm programming I have a bunch

00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:10,269
of the internal constraints right my

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,250
mental capability the way I think a

00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:14,170
whole lot of those things were were

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,899
deterrent determined way before I even

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,029
you know touch the computer that's my

00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:23,130
human capital you accumulate human

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:25,779
capital by investing in it and by also a

00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,880
virtue of whatever genetic environment

00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:30,130
you were endowment you were born with

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,899
daily the kind of luck element but then

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,470
you know other things happen along the

00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:37,480
ways now there are three words that are

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:41,410
almost always used interchangeably out

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,230
there that in economics all mean very

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:47,019
very different things and it's useful to

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:50,649
think about how these things mean have

00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:52,689
different meanings I think the whole

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,689
world makes a lot more sense if you

00:12:52,689 --> 00:13:00,069
actually think in the real meanings of

00:12:55,689 --> 00:13:02,170
these words there's the word price price

00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:03,790
is what you pay up front for something

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,800
you go to the grocery store there's

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,310
there's a price label for those apples

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,880
that you

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:12,370
in the stand and it says 349 a pound and

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:18,029
that's the price of those apples you

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:20,410
know the saying is it about economists

00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,850
an economist is a person who knows the

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,510
price of everything on the value of

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:27,100
nothing yeah the truth there is of

00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,870
course is not that the auditory it's I

00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,740
don't know the value of that pound of

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:34,839
apples to you the basic judgment is that

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,720
Apple's don't have any objective value

00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:40,150
that exists beyond the valuation placed

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,630
by the person who intends to consume

00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:46,360
those apples the apples by themselves

00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:49,630
without somebody's consumption have no

00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,580
value which brings us to the word value

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,589
you go to the groceries you go to I

00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:58,390
don't know home depot and says a two

00:13:53,589 --> 00:14:01,089
hundred dollar value according to whom

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:03,720
now ten dollars why if it's really worth

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:06,640
200 you would be able to sell it for 200

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,650
clearly it's now priced at ten dollars

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:12,490
because nobody's buying the thing at two

00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:16,390
hundred dollars let me judge that value

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:19,030
now the reason I bought this shirt is

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:21,100
because the value to me of this

00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:23,560
particular shirt was greater than the

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:27,430
price somebody was charging for that

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,950
shirt and the reason that shirt was this

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:33,160
shirt was in that store at the time was

00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,960
because the amount the price the store

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,600
paid to the person who's supplying the

00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,230
firm who's supplying this shirt the the

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,490
price they paid to them was greater than

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,950
sorry less than what they thought they

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:50,440
could sell it for the cost to them we

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:52,390
come to the word cost there's nothing

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,380
wrong with saying my car cost you know

00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:58,170
ten thousand dollars to me i paid let's

00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:01,089
say ten thousand dollars for that car

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:03,330
but it didn't cost ten thousand dollars

00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:06,160
to produce if it's a brand new car

00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:08,620
unless there is no free disposal and

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,029
there is no free disposal of of cars but

00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,000
let's think about something that you

00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:14,470
could freely disposed of yeah let's

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,030
forget that for a second let's let's

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,040
assume there's free disposal of cars

00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,579
let's assume that stupid cash for

00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,040
clunkers

00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:22,749
program is still running and you can

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,819
just turn in your car no questions asked

00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:26,529
and somebody destroys it for you but of

00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:30,069
course that's not free to society

00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:32,980
there's a cost to that as well um nobody

00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:36,339
would sell me something for more than

00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:38,589
what it cost them to produce what does

00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:41,049
it mean for something to cost a next

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:42,670
amount of dollars to produce well

00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:44,079
there's the usual stuff there's metal

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,519
that goes into the car there's pain

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,649
there's computer programs there's

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,600
there's gauges there's seat leather all

00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:52,540
sorts of things going to and they all

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,769
have prices in the market but there's

00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:59,649
one more cost into making that car and

00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:02,230
that's the opportunity cost that's the

00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:04,959
person or persons who organized the

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,910
production of that car they could have

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,239
done something else with their time and

00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:13,899
that's what's usually forgotten they

00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:16,110
chose to produce that car and sell it at

00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:20,019
a ten-thousand-dollar price point

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:23,559
because the cost including the material

00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:27,100
cost plus the benefit lay loss from not

00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:30,009
being able to do something else that all

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,470
came below the price at which they could

00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:33,790
sell that car they had a net benefit

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,279
that is greater than every other

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,649
alternative net benefit available to

00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:41,259
them so opportunity cost is simply the

00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:44,470
value of the most preferred foregone

00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:46,419
alternative I derive a certain amount of

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,939
benefit from being here there's no price

00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:53,049
to this there's no dollar sign that says

00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:54,639
you know xenon drives you know fifteen

00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:55,989
hundred dollars worth of benefit from

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,959
being able to stand here and talk to

00:16:55,989 --> 00:17:02,439
like-minded people and have fun but

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,510
there is a value to me you could set up

00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:06,850
an experiment trying to figure that

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,889
value out right you offer me ten bucks

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:13,020
to stop talking 20 bucks to stop talking

00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:16,170
but at some point I'm gonna stop talking

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,240
and that's the point where you figure

00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,040
out what the value to me of being here

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,450
was that's the sense in which you can

00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,680
put a dollar figure on pretty much

00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,680
everything you can figure out

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:29,090
hypothetically we don't care too much

00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:32,360
but hypothetically you could figure out

00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:35,070
what dollar amount would convince people

00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,990
from doing something or would convince

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,700
them to do something and if that

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:42,510
willingness to pay willingness to accept

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:45,030
as we call it are the same then we have

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,580
we have figured out a valuation for that

00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:50,040
thing so that's what opportunity cost is

00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:53,250
the value of the most preferred for gun

00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,480
alternative nothing else matters the

00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,640
fact that I could have also gotten

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,110
penguin hunting during this time doesn't

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,960
matter because it's not my most

00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,730
preferred alternative to this only the

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,020
cost of the most preferred they the

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,970
value of the most preferred alternative

00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,790
matters in terms of figuring out

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:11,220
opportunity cost so here's that example

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:13,320
that was asked of 200 economists with

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,540
PhDs from top economics programs this is

00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:19,230
at the economics job market annual they

00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:22,950
are annual allied social science

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:26,940
meetings I think it was 2005 so you want

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,770
a free ticket to see Eric Clapton in

00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,540
contact but you can't resell the ticket

00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,770
the TSA enforces it your name is on the

00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,810
ticket you have to show up three forms

00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,400
of government ID to get in so you can't

00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,200
really result well that's what they want

00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,440
for these baseball games these days yeah

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,090
it's a national security situation I'm

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,120
exaggerating but there's all that crowd

00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:50,430
you know cramping down on people who try

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:53,330
to resell tickets online it is it not

00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:58,620
otherwise what would life be like

00:18:53,330 --> 00:19:00,720
exactly eggsy so there Bob Dylan is also

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,070
performing on the same night I didn't

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,110
write the question I'm familiar with

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:08,250
these guys but you know I do realize I'm

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:09,840
probably older than a lot of people if

00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,260
you want to see Dylan icon that you have

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,550
to pay forty dollars for the ticket on

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,460
any given day you would be willing to

00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,780
pay up to fifty dollars to see doing

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,400
assume there are no other costs of

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,200
seeing either performer based on this

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,400
information what is the opportunity cost

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,400
of seeing Eric left

00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:46,280
yes i think i'm asking d because the

00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,900
value to to me are seeing Dillon is 50

00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:52,940
and that's what I'm giving up so uh

00:19:49,900 --> 00:20:02,810
right hand corner says says d somebody

00:19:52,940 --> 00:20:04,940
said see why it's the value of the of

00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:06,560
the most preferred foregone alternative

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,630
which the most preferred part doesn't

00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:12,320
matter here we're setting it up as these

00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:20,630
two the ticket price is 40 so that's it

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:24,410
yes well that's okay this is this is

00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:26,990
sort of you know 200 top PhD economists

00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,460
to a PhD economist from two from top

00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,320
schools and eighty percent of time got

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:36,470
it wrong so there's no shame in getting

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:37,280
this wrong well don't get hung up on

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,870
that because there's only two

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:51,080
alternatives here don't get hung up on

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:52,280
the most preferred yes it's the most

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,390
you're willing to spend on it that's it

00:20:52,280 --> 00:21:03,290
that's your alley what do people

00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:04,730
maximize yes okay so there is some

00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:07,250
agreement on it's the most you are

00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:12,710
willing to spend on it I saw one more

00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:15,310
hand I'm having fun i love this yes and

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,310
why is that

00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:27,650
we maximize profit the benefit to you

00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:29,990
from going to see Bob Dylan is ten

00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:33,530
dollars you value it at 50 but the cost

00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:35,360
is 40 that's why when people focus on

00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,040
maximizing market share those companies

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,340
generally go belly up because prophet

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,820
the amount of money you get to keep from

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:46,400
our operations is what keeps the company

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,790
going the value to you of seeing Dillon

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,950
is 50 but you have to pay 40 to see him

00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:55,760
so what you're giving up is ten dollar

00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:58,460
benefit if you go see Eric Clapton the

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,000
air Clapton thing only matters in so far

00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:04,460
as if you value seeing interlaken by

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,380
more than ten dollars say value if you

00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,630
value you place they'll senior Clapton

00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:11,210
was $11 then as a person who's

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:17,270
maximizing neff benefit you should go

00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:19,040
see Eric Clapton does that make sense so

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:21,800
it's kind of by having that free

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:25,130
alternative there it throws you server I

00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,840
did I see a hand there no I don't want

00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,160
to miss any questions I this is just

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,840
general economic style we like

00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,110
interruptions we don't like questions at

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,000
the end I we just like questions to come

00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:38,360
whenever they there so feel free to just

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,950
but any be ten dollars is the right

00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,680
answer because that would be the net

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:45,340
benefit from actually seeing Bob Dylan

00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,480
in concert to you given these parameters

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,610
you would have to spend the forty

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,920
dollars you have to pay something to be

00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:55,250
able to get that benefit the aircraft

00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,600
and things is not really relevant to the

00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,630
true correct answer to this question

00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,150
other than the fact that if you if you

00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:04,310
later tell me that you saw Clapton then

00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:06,920
I know you valued Clapton at more than

00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:08,870
ten dollars not more than 50 but more

00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:17,030
than ten dollars oh come on i have this

00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:18,530
thing sorry i don't want people to

00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,840
change my password if i walk away

00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,870
slightly says yeah it's on a hair

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,870
trigger

00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:34,110
um I can send your link if your mailman

00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:37,470
I but a lot of people i think got stuck

00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:39,810
at the at the AMD alternatives but my

00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:42,210
memory might be incorrect i have to look

00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:44,670
this up again this was mentioned in The

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,140
New York Times blog by again my favorite

00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:48,330
one of my favorite professors Robert

00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,490
Frank who was the main reason I was

00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,140
extremely excited to run when I got

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:54,840
accepted to Cornell everybody else

00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,450
rejected me but Cornell said yes and I

00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,540
was extremely happy because his article

00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:02,160
back in nineteen eighty-seven dollars uh

00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,990
if homo economicus could choose would he

00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,760
choose a utility function with a

00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:07,290
conscience that's that was one of the

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,960
things that convinced me that economics

00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:11,970
was actually we're studying he mentioned

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,770
this in a New York Times blog as well

00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,870
and that might be and he does these

00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,490
kinds of anecdotes really well one of my

00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,020
hardest ta assignments was for him

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,220
because all the students would love him

00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,290
and then at the end of the year I would

00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,140
get these evaluations Bob Frank is

00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:29,430
beautiful wonderful exciting fun class

00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:31,440
but Sinan sucks because he does these

00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:35,070
anecdotes really really well and then

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:38,370
you have to go great the quizzes nobody

00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:40,710
likes the guy who grades the quizzes but

00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:43,710
anyway and then I started teaching my

00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:46,440
class and using some of that material

00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:50,130
the key factor here is is subjectivity

00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:52,320
the valuation of which singers better

00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:57,900
than the other is a subjective matter

00:24:52,320 --> 00:25:00,710
the the valuation of what is the best

00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:04,800
thing you can do with your time is

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:09,270
subjective there is no objective measure

00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:11,010
there if you're if you think your friend

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,600
is wasting his time of course this

00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,880
happens like I do it all the time i

00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,930
procrastinate I I have the slacker thing

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,760
here you know maybe getting stuck on

00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:22,500
watching reruns of New Jersey housewives

00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,540
is not the best use of your time when

00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,610
stuff needs to be done you can try to

00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:29,130
convince people you know Val you're not

00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,990
really valuing time correctly etc but

00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:34,230
the subjectivity you can't you can't

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:36,620
avoid ultimately the person who's making

00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,960
the decision is the person who's

00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,970
possible for that value judgment now

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,490
this is where all the you know smart the

00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:45,710
students in the in the classroom would

00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,809
just fall asleep but I want to also

00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:53,059
automatically show you something real

00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:54,970
quick suppose there are alternative

00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:58,850
things you can do with your time x and y

00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:02,180
each unit of doing x takes the X amount

00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:04,580
of time each the unit of doing white xty

00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,230
amount of time to complete usually in an

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,290
economics class these would actually be

00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:11,000
price of X price of why but I wanted to

00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,950
emphasize this reasoning that is not

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,110
just limited to the price of Apple's and

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,720
price of oranges but with any arbitrary

00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:20,690
kinds of things you have total amount T

00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:24,860
available to do these tasks therefore

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:27,410
your constraint is time it takes to do

00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:31,340
one unit of x times the number of units

00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:34,309
of x you want to do time it takes to do

00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,990
a unit of Y times the number of units of

00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:39,890
why you want to do must be less than or

00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:42,470
equal to total time time you want to

00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:45,980
spend with your family time you have to

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:50,420
spend at work I they must add up to less

00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:52,070
than total available time in a day what

00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,809
is the objective the objective is also

00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,700
different for everybody there is

00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:57,320
consumption there's stuff you like to do

00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,330
with your family that costs money and

00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,850
then you have a wage rate that

00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:06,050
determines how much you get paid for

00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:07,910
time you give up with your family to be

00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:10,550
able to work and actually make that

00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:14,210
money trade-offs come from where the

00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:16,670
objectives meet the constraints the

00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:19,190
opportunity costs in this case comes

00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:23,300
from the nice little triangle does this

00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:25,130
constraint would draw into space there

00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,860
we have it if you spent all your time

00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:30,950
doing why you would get t over t why

00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:33,440
amount of why they spend all their time

00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,929
doing X you would get T over T X amount

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,820
of time ninety-nine percent of

00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:41,150
undergrads it confused that the slope

00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:45,740
has x in the numerator that's your

00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:47,990
opportunity cost of doing an extra unit

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:52,580
of X

00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:54,740
in terms of units of Y if you want to do

00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:58,250
one more unit of X you would have to

00:27:54,740 --> 00:28:01,040
spend TX amount of time on that divide

00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,600
that by t y that gives you how much how

00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,059
many minutes of why you would give up

00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:09,740
that's the opportunity cost in terms of

00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:12,170
time of doing one more unit of x now the

00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,790
value of those time units is different

00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,990
for everybody it was good when Bill

00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,940
Gates was actually working on an

00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,790
income-generating activity I would just

00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:21,559
say you know Bill Gates's time is valued

00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:25,580
much hot much more highly than my time

00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:27,040
because by the him spending is one hour

00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,220
on an income-generating activities

00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:34,370
generating much more income than I do

00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:37,429
that trade off what it takes to do X /

00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:40,790
what it takes to do y is key to a lot of

00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:45,020
a lot of conflict in life work and

00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:48,320
everything else worth emphasizing can't

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:50,750
optimize without an objective and the

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,970
problem is what is the objective now

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,650
another wonderful article that convinced

00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:56,540
me again that economics is worth

00:28:54,650 --> 00:29:00,050
studying is the F connection families

00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:04,429
friends and firms and in that trio of

00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:07,190
families friends and firms firms are the

00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:10,670
most deliberately chosen most voluntary

00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:13,309
form of human organization that exists

00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:16,420
you do not I'm over time I'm sorry you

00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:19,460
do not choose how much I who you're with

00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:21,500
who your family is and your friends have

00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,570
to do with childhood what is the

00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,550
objective of firm firms objective is to

00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:30,530
maximize the neck benefit to the owners

00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:33,350
of the firm I 30 seconds JT that is

00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:35,270
profit when you get mismatch between the

00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:37,970
objectives of the firm and objectives of

00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:40,460
the programmer you hear conflict and I

00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:43,370
think the way an economist looks at the

00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:46,460
agile manifesto is trying to figure out

00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:48,260
a way of communicating between the

00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,750
owners of the firm and the programmers

00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:53,240
the value to the owners of doing certain

00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,980
things and the cost to programmers of

00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,230
dudes doing those things so you can

00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,850
maximize the net benefit the difference

00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:02,119
between the value the total value it

00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,799
generates for the firm minus the total

00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:06,909
actually achieving that for the firm

00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:11,589
these are practical micro concerns and

00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:14,059
that is you know my look at a gelatinous

00:30:11,589 --> 00:30:16,219
that's why those meetings those cards

00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:17,539
are important I will shut up now if you

00:30:16,219 --> 00:30:20,619
have questions I'll be out there thank

00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:20,619
