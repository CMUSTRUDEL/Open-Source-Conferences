Title: Katherine Toomajian - ‎The Care and Feeding of Volunteers: Lessons from Non-Profits and OSS‎
Publication date: 2013-08-20
Playlist: YAPC::NA 2013
Description: 
	Volunteers are the lifeblood of OSS projects. From behemoths like the Linux Foundation to every little project on SourceForge, volunteers keep things moving forward. Retaining happy and motivated volunteers is a crucial step in creating a healthy organization.

Working with a team which consists primarily of volunteers can make herding cats look simple and straightforward. Not only do you need to find volunteers, but once you have them, you need to foster, encourage, and motivate them to accomplish not only their goals, but your organization's goals as well. This is difficult to do, but not as impossible as it may sound.

The first step is to understand that not every person interested in helping with your project will actually know what they're doing. Most non-profit organizations understand that there's some amount of mentoring required to get even the most talented volunteer ready to actually help. This a step that OSS projects often forget, and it is why recruiting and retaining dedicated volunteers can be so difficult.

I will discuss ways to create an environment that encourages volunteer participation, direction, and retention, using a variety of methods garnered from my experiences in both OSS and non-profit organizations.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,379
alright can everyone hear me okay

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:10,590
awesome awesome alright so welcome to

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:17,940
care and feeding of volunteers or how

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:20,750
can volunteers right so just a quick

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,980
word I'm presenting primarily for

00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,230
projects that i have a user base but

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,849
already but need more volunteers other

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,300
folks can listen in but that's primarily

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,730
who this talk is aimed towards so about

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,829
me hi my name is Captain Megan um this

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:40,079
is my first gat seat this is also my

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:42,120
first talk so I've known as are who we

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,850
on most of the internet and my staff

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,010
account on dreamwidth is Miss cat I work

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,809
for dream wit studios LLC which is an

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,270
open source blogging platform forcing

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,840
the livejournal code base in 2008 we

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,250
have approximately 300,000 lines of code

00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,030
it's co-owned by Denise pallucci and

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,949
Mark Smith we've got between 50 and 60

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,600
active volunteers on various parts of

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,900
the site and about two-thirds of those

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,299
volunteers or women so my actual job is

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,770
community and volunteer support I mostly

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,720
interface between the users and the

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,330
developers I point out bugs I handle a

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,850
lot of the documentation I handled or a

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,500
hand told for new volunteers and I also

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,600
manage my community so that means I'm on

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,920
IRC a lot I answer a lot of questions

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,200
and I'm a friendly face for people who

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,970
are new to the project misuari's

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,740
experience goes I've been a non-profit

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,600
volunteer for about 15 years with

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,490
various organizations and I've been a

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,829
non-profit volunteer management for

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,659
about five years which I've got about 25

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:42,030
to 30 people under me and that um and

00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:43,110
yeah I'm as far as open source projects

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,329
go I've been involved with dreamwidth

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,770
for about four years now I've been the

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,479
co-lead of our support team for about

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,090
three and a half and then I got hired on

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,729
in January of this year doing support

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,890
full time so I also help with archive of

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,030
our own and grow store got consulted

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,770
with both of those on their support

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,939
systems so why am i giving this talk

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,520
there's some general perceptions about

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,740
open source technology in that it's all

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,550
male it's hostile the newcomers and you

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,260
need to already have experience

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,150
absolutely with programming hope

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,340
with that language and preferably with a

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,200
similar project there's also a

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,879
perception of an interview process where

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,250
the potential volunteer needs to prove

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,360
themselves before they're worthy to

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:27,250
submit to your codebase so let's go

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,780
ahead and break that down first of all

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,200
half the people on this planet are not

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,450
male in fact in technology about ten to

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,359
thirty percent of all tech professionals

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:41,079
in non open source technology identify

00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:43,959
as female but in open source tech 1.5 to

00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:46,299
five percent identify as female that's a

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,540
really big disparity and that's a huge

00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:52,060
untapped market so every person at one

00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,560
point or another is a newcomer everyone

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,510
writes their first line of code everyone

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,370
does hello world you have to remember

00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,109
that you know people have to start

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,900
somewhere so why not with your project

00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:03,549
and being mean to them makes them go

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,400
away and that's not what you want you

00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:09,310
want them to stay um as far as

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,739
experience goes you can't get experience

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,260
unless somebody lets you get experience

00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:16,750
so it's kind of a catch-22 as far as

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,760
that goes also your project is not

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,470
interviewing your volunteer your

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,930
volunteer is interviewing your project

00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:28,199
so as wil wheaton says don't be a dick

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,940
thank you will be and we appreciate you

00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:34,269
so your project is not a special

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,220
snowflake like at all there are a lot of

00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:37,540
projects out there and your potential

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,389
volunteers definitely have a lot of

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,040
options so they probably don't have any

00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:43,599
sort of emotional attachment to your

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,099
project they just think it looks kind of

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,419
cool and there's a lot of different

00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,160
reasons that people might be looking to

00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:50,949
volunteer maybe they want to learn to

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,269
code maybe there's just this one bug

00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:53,650
that's been driving them nuts for two

00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:55,599
and a half years and they're really sick

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,230
of it so they decide to submit a patch

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,879
and go forward just as a back check

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,480
that's how most of our volunteers got

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,010
started um so there and they're probably

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,229
just looking for something interesting

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,790
to do with their spare time also if they

00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:11,889
already use your software and you run

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,739
them off you're going to lose a user as

00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:17,139
well as a potential volunteer which it

00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:19,539
kind of as a lose-lose situation for you

00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:21,060
so when they stop in there probably

00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:22,639
checking out your culture your

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,930
environment

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,009
the other people that might be involved

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,810
with your project whether it's somebody

00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:30,080
that they know are somebody they've

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,699
heard of or pretty much anything else I

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,289
mean it really does vary by person they

00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:35,479
could be checking out the accessibility

00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:37,009
of your technology what the backend

00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:39,400
stuff you use whether it's get versus

00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:43,639
mercurial or bugzilla verses 16 bugs

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:47,569
something along those lines so step zero

00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:52,729
how do I people so be nice if your

00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:54,590
project thank you so if your project has

00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:59,539
a public IRC channel try to keep it at

00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,949
least pg-13 or lower so you know just

00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:02,029
make it really comfortable for people to

00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:06,849
be there and don't make them

00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:10,159
unnecessarily uncomfortable excuse me

00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:13,069
all right so a community behavior

00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:14,750
standards should ideally self enforce if

00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:17,990
peer pressure really does work both ways

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:21,229
so there's also a combative versus

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,240
collaborative arguments so it's okay

00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:24,919
argue but just make sure that you're not

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,999
running people off when you argue you

00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:28,120
want to be able to sit down with them

00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:31,969
and have a beer at the end of the day

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,759
also woman is not a four-letter word and

00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:36,319
neither is diversity so writing someone

00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,180
off because of their gender sexual

00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,680
orientation race disability coding

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,409
ability or anyone of any number of

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,490
things not only is it really really bad

00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:48,529
it also drives people away also try not

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,509
to use ableist language don't make

00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:52,639
racist jokes and don't make sexist jokes

00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:55,490
they're not funny and you will alienate

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,199
somebody if someone's offended the thing

00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,610
you don't want to tell them is oh go get

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,979
a thicker skin or you're being too

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:07,370
sensitive you should just try being less

00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:12,289
abrasive um also be welcoming it says hi

00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:14,419
guys all right so being welcoming you

00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:16,009
want to lower the entry barrier if you

00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:18,289
think it's low already try making it

00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,669
lower you really want to make it easy to

00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:20,870
get started with your project and we're

00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:23,300
going to talk more about that in just a

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,789
minute here so the catchphrase of dream

00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,009
west IRC channel is be where you will be

00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:29,990
welcomed we have a standard set of

00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:32,539
welcoming URLs designed to give a crash

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,490
course in the culture in the project and

00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,000
how to do like the really basic stuff

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,460
like

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,410
it bugs and you know how to use get and

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,510
all that good kind of stuff our

00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:45,200
welcoming URLs include a links to our

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:47,540
wiki or bugzilla as well as our quotes

00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,490
database are common glossary or common

00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,920
terminology glossary or jargon page as

00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:55,250
well as our github depository repository

00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,960
there we go as an aside it's also really

00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,970
important to document your culture as

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,350
well as your code if you document your

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,990
culture it makes it a lot easier for

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:05,150
people to break into your project and if

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,160
you make it easier to break in you get

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,600
more developers and that means less work

00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,300
for you in the long run so that's

00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,710
definitely a positive I mean you want to

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,960
make sure that new people are able to

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,550
code for you so you want to have really

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,220
clear steps for how they can get

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,470
involved that really lowers the barrier

00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,150
to entry so dream what has two

00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,940
communities one called dream with dev

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,320
and one called dream of dev training so

00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,090
dream with Deb is mostly for our senior

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,800
people to kind of keep people posted on

00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,110
what we're doing what's new with the

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,419
process and dream with Deb training is

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,700
specifically designed for people who are

00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:39,020
brand new to be able to go and ask

00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,290
questions they're really basic stuff

00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,070
like how do i submit a pull request

00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,330
things that they might not know if

00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,720
they've never worked with a project

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,130
before we also have our wiki RC bugzilla

00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,950
which allows them to see what's

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,360
available to fix how to guides for the

00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,150
really simple stuff are really really

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,620
important it again it lowers the barrier

00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,840
to entry makes it really easy for people

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,360
to get started with your project it also

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:07,400
is really helpful to have a contact

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:09,919
person or people available it gives

00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,960
people a job to do and if you have a job

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,210
you can say this is my job this is my

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,370
responsibility not only does it again

00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,750
lower the barrier to entry but it also

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,760
creates a sense of involvement and

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,169
responsibility in your community people

00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,550
who are responsible are going to stick

00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:24,229
around if they feel like they have a job

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,490
they're going to stick around and you

00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:27,910
want them to stick around because that

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:33,409
means there's less work for you

00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:34,909
mentoring is definitely your friend you

00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,099
know you want to make sure that there's

00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:41,479
a way for people to get started to go

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:42,710
from user to developer to leadership you

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,140
want to make sure there's a super clear

00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,850
progression as far as that goes because

00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,750
again it lowers the barrier to entry if

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:53,210
people can have an idea

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:54,950
what to expect next let's hear again

00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,300
mentoring is really important having

00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,850
somebody who can be that point person

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,320
for a new person like you know if

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,470
somebody comes into our IRC channel and

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,660
is like hey guys I've never done coding

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,310
before who do I talk to you can say oh

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,560
you should go talk to Kat Kat knows

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:12,110
things cat has these URLs and if I'm not

00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,150
around they can say info bot welcome and

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,210
literally everything will just pop up

00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:19,970
right there it's super awesome so having

00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:26,690
mentors available gives people a way to

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:28,700
ask questions so step 2 what can you do

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,800
with a newbie dev training your

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,240
developers as a step that a lot of open

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,010
source projects skip over but it's

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,260
something that nonprofit organizations

00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,790
understand innately so like for Girl

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,110
Scouts you start as a girl scout and

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,370
then as you get a little bit older you

00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,450
start working with the younger kids and

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,150
eventually you end up as a troop leader

00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:46,420
it's pretty clear progression for open

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,430
source the pathways should be user

00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,050
developer leadership so someone uses

00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,120
your software that person moves into

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,070
developing your software and then they

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,780
eventually take on a leadership role in

00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,790
helping other people develop your

00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,230
software it's a nice cycle it helps

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,030
develop your skills along the way and

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,089
the training is actually built into your

00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:07,550
culture so developer development is a

00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:09,500
lifestyle it takes a lot of effort to

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,450
nurture a volunteer from New be too

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,030
experienced programmer but this effort

00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:16,910
is absolutely worthwhile for example

00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,860
dreamwidth brought 14 developers and

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,870
staff to Yap see this year we paid for

00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,790
their airfare their hotel room their

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,589
conference fees this energizes our

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,330
community and I guarantee that we are

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:28,490
going to see a huge jump in production

00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,230
on Thursday and Friday as well as for

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,370
the next couple of months because it

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,780
really gets people excited about the

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,730
project again especially if it's been

00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:39,500
you know kind of slow or its end of

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:42,080
winter and so on and so forth so

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,870
investing in your community there's a

00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,790
lot of fears that open source projects

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,680
might have well they don't know enough

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,540
to be useful so why should I bother or I

00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,520
have more important things to do than to

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,630
hold this new person's hand or if they

00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,460
have a question they're just going to

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:57,680
ask I mean I don't need to go and make

00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:00,470
sure that they can answer ass

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,580
question or if they really wanted to

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,100
learn they would do it the way I did

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,290
carrying bits in an old bucket uphill

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:12,740
both ways through a snowstorm on a 56k

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:14,810
modem so don't be this guy so the

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,520
rebuttals to this knowledge is an

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,890
acquired thing you have to learn

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,190
learning happens you can't just

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,899
magically appear and know everything

00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,910
there is literally nothing more

00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:28,700
important for you to do than to mentor

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:31,630
your new developers everyone wants to

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,950
believe that their project is mostly

00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:35,810
accessible for people to just be able to

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:38,180
go and ask questions but think about

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,370
this do newbies in your IRC channel or

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,470
on your mailing list ask questions if

00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,700
you can't think of the time then maybe

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:47,000
you're not as welcoming as you think you

00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,980
are also somebody asks the question let

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,560
me google that for you or did you read

00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,680
the documentation those are not helpful

00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,600
answers they're not answers at all and

00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,250
they're really unwelcoming and they

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,680
drive people away they make people feel

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,110
stupid and that's not a way to help get

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,029
developers so for most people it's also

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:07,730
really hard to sell start and to learn

00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,900
in a vacuum so maybe you had to because

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,980
there wasn't anyone else around to help

00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:13,130
you or you didn't have good internet

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,770
access at home in this day and age you

00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,209
are the resource so make sure you have

00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:22,430
that responsibility to your community

00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:24,800
and become that resource so newbie

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,810
developers many of our developers

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,250
started out brand new it's a thing that

00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,080
dream with is kind of known for if

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,400
you're an experienced developer who

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,230
doesn't need the mentoring or hand

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,580
holding it's not forced on you or

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,810
anything but it's definitely an option

00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,680
that's available if you feel that you

00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:43,100
need it so what can a newbie developer

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,839
do let them work on really really small

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,700
bugs there's always those little tiny

00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,860
bugs that are super annoying but might

00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,779
not be important enough to fix or you

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,600
don't have time or oh I'll get to it

00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:55,430
later nobody developers that's kind of a

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,950
really good thing for them to be able to

00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,779
do so just go through your bug base do a

00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,640
cursory review and if they look pretty

00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,680
easy like just adding white space or

00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:07,250
adding something to a drop-down menu go

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,790
ahead and mark it or tag it as effort

00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,329
minor or as dev bait for people to come

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,559
in and

00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:15,019
tice them to start with your community

00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,329
dreama also post those type of bugs to

00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,709
our training community which those tend

00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,179
to get jumped on really quickly for

00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:21,829
people who just want to get started and

00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:23,689
don't really know where to start it can

00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:26,269
be really intimidating to look at you

00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:27,769
know a couple thousand bugs and be like

00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:29,660
I don't know what I can do so if you

00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:31,999
pull them out it also lowers that

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,819
barrier to entry so there's three perks

00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:36,230
to this your tiny bugs get fixed without

00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:38,389
any senior development time getting

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,790
taken up you don't have to train any bad

00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:43,069
habit out of them because you're

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,569
training them from the ground up and it

00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:46,850
also gives your blossom and developer

00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:49,100
something they can point to and say look

00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,290
see that I did that that's the thing

00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,239
that I did and not only can they do that

00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,399
at least Im dream with when we do our

00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:57,649
code tours other people will come in and

00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:59,660
say yeah you totally did that thing that

00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:01,730
is a thing that you just did and I'm

00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,889
really proud of you or I'm really happy

00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:06,199
that you did that thing that is the best

00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:07,549
feeling in the world and I'm not going

00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:08,929
to lie like that's totally part of the

00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:10,879
reason why I started working with

00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:12,470
dreamwidth it's because I got that

00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:13,879
motivation we're going to talk about

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,549
that a little bit more in just a second

00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:25,069
here as well and that totally makes them

00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:26,779
go so step 3 ? ? ? every project and

00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:29,239
every developer has special needs and

00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:30,949
that's okay look at your projects

00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:32,629
culture or what you want that culture to

00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:36,559
be to find out what you need to focus on

00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:39,079
so dreamwidth places a huge emphasis on

00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:42,470
accessible tech and we train that into

00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:43,610
our developers from day one like that's

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,899
one of the first things that you learn

00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,309
about the dream with project is that we

00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:47,449
want to be accessible we want to make

00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:49,369
sure that things are available to

00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:51,949
everybody so you don't have to hack it

00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:53,600
on later or added on as a like an

00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:55,009
afterthought like oh yeah maybe I should

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,869
make this accessible that's something

00:14:55,009 --> 00:15:01,579
that we do from day one um and we don't

00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:05,269
back engineer either which is really

00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:07,399
helpful so be encouraging give credit

00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:09,110
where credit's due and Girl Scouts have

00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:12,169
merit badges and greenwith puts your

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,819
name in a news post we also do code

00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:15,889
tours which highlight the developer who

00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:17,329
is working on a bug even if they're like

00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:19,009
the really obscure ones that are on the

00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:21,319
back end we kind of explain them for our

00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:22,579
user base to say yeah I have no idea

00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:25,420
what this thing is

00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:29,149
it it works now so that's really awesome

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,529
and we also have other volunteers do

00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:32,239
that people who might not necessarily be

00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,069
developers it gets them a little more

00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:36,259
familiarized with their code base and

00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:40,519
with our project which definitely a

00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:41,660
win-win also a bribery can totally be

00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,509
acceptable under certain circumstances

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,889
I've been known to bacon send cookies to

00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:49,369
developers if they fix a bug that's been

00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:55,970
driving me nuts my boss knit socks for

00:15:49,369 --> 00:15:58,459
code so yes if you call it a dream with

00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,410
you will get socks probably it's part of

00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:03,230
our culture and it works well enough for

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:05,499
us your mileage may vary but seriously

00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,239
bacon cook uses definitely recommended

00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:10,910
also be willing to write references for

00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:12,529
your community who's participating it's

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,670
a really great motivator especially for

00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:15,259
people who are just getting started in

00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:19,369
the tech industry to have a way to be

00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:21,649
able to say you know yes mr. manager I

00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:23,720
have coded things before and here's a

00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:25,879
reference from the person that I worked

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,129
with and then Denise right some

00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:30,499
super-awesome like yeah they're totally

00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:32,449
awesome letter and then you get hired so

00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:34,009
more people being employed in the

00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:37,339
community is also a good thing because

00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:38,540
we all like to eat so imposter syndrome

00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:39,919
we're going to talk about that for just

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,660
a second here it's something that you

00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,509
really need to be on the lookout for in

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,309
your community imposter syndrome is the

00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:47,689
constant feeling that any minute

00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:51,259
everyone around you will find out that

00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:52,429
you're faking it so when imposter

00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:54,290
syndrome is the difference between

00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:55,579
abandoning several months of work on a

00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,929
patch because you're confused about

00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:58,069
something but you don't want to ask a

00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:59,899
question because you feel like you

00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:01,879
should know the answer and that people

00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:05,000
are going to make fun of you if you ask

00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:08,980
or just being comfortable asking the

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,329
question which would you prefer I mean

00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,409
let's not throw away those several

00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,120
months worth of work just because you

00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:16,250
don't want to ask a question so make

00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,720
your community available to people to

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,579
ask questions don't ridicule them if

00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,549
they ask questions also provide

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:24,799
encouragement and positive reinforcement

00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:28,039
just be just be aware that that's the

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,200
thing that can happen so be flexible

00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:32,299
there's a place for almost everyone in

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,919
your organization the only people that

00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,040
there are not room for are the people

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,650
who are not positive

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,690
lenses cheerleaders are important

00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,460
community management is extremely

00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,470
important creating a welcoming and

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,270
opening environment is very very

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,410
important not everyone who's involved

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,970
with your project is going to be

00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,410
interested in coding and that's okay

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,050
these people can still be valuable

00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,130
contributors to your community

00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,720
cheerleaders encourage your developers

00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,060
and show them that their hard work is

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,820
affecting someone when we get a result

00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,560
fixed coming through on IRC there's

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,600
pretty much universally a whole lot of

00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,260
cheering when that happens because hey I

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,880
think just got done yay let's go us who

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:13,890
can I get a show of hands who actually

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:18,090
likes writing documentation you don't

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:19,590
count you don't count so people who

00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,080
aren't necessarily developers can

00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,220
totally right documentation for you give

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,950
them something to do they're going to

00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,260
stick around with your project also end

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,450
user support is a really great great way

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,030
to get people involved end user support

00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:38,100
is a gateway develop or gateway drug to

00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:39,510
development so step four profit yay by

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,070
mentoring your developers you help to

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,050
ensure the long-term survival of your

00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,430
project people who work on something are

00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,480
more likely to get invested and if

00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,070
they're invested they're going to bring

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,180
their friends more developers for you

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:52,770
win-win nurturing your developers is

00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,570
really the next best thing to having a

00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,360
developer custom built at the developer

00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,800
factory as I said before no bad habits

00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,850
can be trained out of them they're going

00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,380
to learn your products from the ground

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,700
up and they're going to learn what you

00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,730
want them to learn how you want them to

00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,800
learn it so let's recap be nice learn

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,170
how two people lower your entry barriers

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,760
mentor your developers project specific

00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:15,510
goals and ensure the long-term survival

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:18,720
of your project in conclusion how can

00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:20,340
you do this in your project well you can

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,830
do them all you absolutely can this is

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,660
totally a thing that you can do but pick

00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,940
one to start probably being nice and

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,770
welcoming and making your environment

00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,990
more like likely to nurture and

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,760
encourage you to developers master that

00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,850
one thing and then move on to the next

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,290
one learning how to newcomers takes time

00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,660
just like it takes time to learn how to

00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,340
code so be patient ask for help when you

00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,700
need it and when in doubt consult your

00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:47,360
reference so birthday hat hedgehog says

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,360
thanks for listening

00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,520
does anyone have any questions or

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,809
comments there's a hedgehog up there so

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,070
that's good it totally is cuz they're

00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:07,049
like little tiny knitting needle

00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,049
factories I'm gonna take my mic off now

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,340
the idea incorrectly Persian people

00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,720
would take through low paying for it to

00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,250
begin with yeah low-hanging fruits

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,860
definitely a good idea and that's not

00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,570
just think board new developer for new

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,880
developers in terms of development it's

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,320
also a good thing you can term it as a

00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,940
very good thing for experienced

00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,190
developers do because you can say like

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,230
oh it's not fit you don't have to

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,789
explicitly say this but oh it's not that

00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,720
we want you to do something easy because

00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:42,429
we don't trust the he write good code

00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,750
once you do something easy because the

00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:46,539
sooner we get you to contribute

00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:49,510
something then the sooner we've reeled

00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:51,850
you in to contributing more maybe it

00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,860
that way then it's like oh hey they you

00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,440
know now I've contributed like free-hugs

00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,690
I pick this huge thing to work on it I'm

00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,520
good enough to do but oh I already

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,440
contributor so I know that I can do it

00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,059
and so I'm more likely to finish it it's

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,990
definitely a way to help combat imposter

00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:09,990
syndrome for sure yeah anybody else

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,990
Jenna

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:36,470
so there's that kind of brand as well in

00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:38,690
terms of people people's um I guess

00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:43,640
their their attachment to their work so

00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:45,020
that they're much more susceptible yeah

00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,549
and it's definitely really important

00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,990
that when you get that first or second

00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:49,159
or third patch from somebody maybe

00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,750
somebody that you don't even know who

00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,039
hasn't jumped in your IRC channel but

00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,320
they just submit that pull request on

00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:56,630
github that you are super encouraging

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,090
with that code review yeah this thing is

00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:04,490
awesome I love the way that you use that

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:06,260
curly bracket that was like inspired you

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,669
know just if even if it's just something

00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,679
really simple if it's like a one-line

00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:12,380
fix this is amazing that you did this in

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,330
one line you know just it's a work of

00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:20,510
art it's brilliant like lay it on thick

00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:22,669
I mean really want this has been driving

00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:26,090
me nuts thank you for fixing this

00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:28,429
absolutely you know once you get past

00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,440
those first couple bugs and you start to

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:31,700
get a feel for the community that's when

00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,020
you start really getting people hooked

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,850
so you want to make sure that those

00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:40,090
first couple interactions you have are

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:40,090
like spot-on super awesome yeah

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:44,230
absolutely

00:22:52,650 --> 00:23:01,150
so uh so uh the way that about ninety

00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,950
percent of our project leads kind of got

00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,750
roped into being project leads i

00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,720
certainly don't know anybody like that

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:09,340
is because they hung around an IRC too

00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,740
much and we're just a little bit too

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:14,700
enthusiastic and then they suddenly hey

00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:18,250
cat you're in charge of support what oh

00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:20,470
okay yeah let's do it and then like at

00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,690
that point i totally stepped up and i

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,700
was in charge of support well with me

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,970
and two other super awesome ladies hi

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,470
Tom and Ken la um and yeah like giving

00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,580
people responsibility is definitely a

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,320
way to make them invest in your

00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:56,770
community and a way to help them stick

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:58,420
around yes primarily if users are

00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,610
developers and you're writing a library

00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,500
there's definitely a way to encourage

00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,640
them unfortunately I don't write

00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,140
libraries and I'm not super familiar

00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:23,070
with that but Debra can totally answer

00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:26,200
your question I'm gonna fix it because I

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:30,220
and you can make the face and what so

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,840
often happens is we know you are we're

00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,600
not going to prioritize looking at your

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,810
code review you don't understand why a

00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,400
doctor

00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:40,100
don't understand where you get that

00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,870
extra not going to ask why you know so

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,620
like but there have been multiple

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:50,300
projects where mrs. Hemple for me and i

00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:52,550
know this i know you say hey I gotta fix

00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:56,410
up one thing on that library and that

00:24:52,550 --> 00:25:01,610
you know hot format that framework and

00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:03,560
make your first commit guess not just

00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,960
rejected for a good reason but just your

00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:08,570
for rejected because we don't understand

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,550
you go away and you are never going to

00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:12,080

00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:28,580

out here in your arms to know where your

00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,430

out to you maybe they want to be a

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,190
developer and if it doesn't fit to your

00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,470
formatting guides or it's not exactly

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,880
what you're looking for instead of just

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,260
rejecting it whole cloth or just

00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,610
ignoring it or writing it off or just

00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,810
