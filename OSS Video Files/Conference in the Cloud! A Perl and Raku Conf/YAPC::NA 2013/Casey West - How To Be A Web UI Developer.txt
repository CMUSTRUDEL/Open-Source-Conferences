Publication date: 2013-08-20
Playlist: YAPC::NA 2013
Description: 
	In this talk I'll show how to use tools to build web application interfaces that will make you look like a rockstar. Your UI can be beautiful, functional, and well tested, too.

Much like our first time on CPAN, it can be difficult to know what tools are going to make your life easy, and make you a rockstar, and which won't.

If you're building web applications with Perl you'll want to have these time saving, happy-user creating tips, tricks, and tools at the ready. We will build a simple app using these tools so you can see them in action.
