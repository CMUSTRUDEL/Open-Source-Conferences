so I guess hello or hey hey or shall I

00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,340
should really have sort of a hat and

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:17,100
sort of put it on backwards for that

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:19,619
hello hello good morning I'm here today

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,380
with a somber message it doesn't matter

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:26,220
what we do at this point

00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:29,550
javascript has already won most people

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:36,090
just haven't realized it yet that's fine

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:38,430
they will hi I'm mark I programmed Perl

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,370
5 by program Paul 6 I programmed

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,410
JavaScript occasionally and a bunch of

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,100
other languages and I'm here to talk

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,230
about depending on your perspective and

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,420
your mood a worrying trend or an

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,440
absolutely fantastic trend or just a

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,760
trend or an on trend or something

00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,789
pretend that what I'm going to tell you

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,449
now is absolutely true it doesn't matter

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,479
but it might help 15 years ago I was

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:09,540
visited by my future self from 15 years

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,790
in the future and presented with the

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,710
age-old question what do you actually do

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,450
when when you're in this situation what

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,290
what do you talk about you ask for

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:22,860
advice what do you do so are there

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,259
flying cars in the future and the answer

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,420
was no

00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:29,040
there are self-driving cars but that's

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,549
that's about it they still go on the

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,740
ground

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,979
what about aliens have you found aliens

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,880
and yes we found them but the boring I

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,980
don't want to talk about

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,680
let's talk about something okay how does

00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:46,850
computing look 30 years in the future

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,960
what from from 15 years back then and

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:53,730
the answer was widely interesting in

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,130
2028 the web browser has been sort of

00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:59,130
slimmed and refined and reduced to its

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,370
bare essence what it really should have

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:05,790
done from the beginning and now it does

00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:17,610
only that it presents pictures of cute

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:29,400
kitten kitten so the rest of this talk

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:31,740
will just not actually what really

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,150
happened was I I was starting to prepare

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:39,000
course material for for JavaScript about

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:43,170
a year ago last summer and I came back

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,080
to the language after a few years of not

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,760
being a webmaster and I came back to it

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,260
and looked at all the material on the

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:57,989
web and went wow something is happening

00:02:52,260 --> 00:03:00,870
here javascript will power it all it

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:05,010
will be the most used language in the

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:07,350
world if it isn't already and there's a

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,989
dynamic here it's the most hated and the

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,280
most appreciated language in the world

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,900
it's the most hated language in the

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,290
world because everyone remembers that

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,250
time back in 97 where it animated our

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:22,260
webpages and made silly butterflies flap

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:26,730
after our mouse pointer or whatever

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:30,959
totally useless so I would have

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,610
protested against my 30 year older self

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,530
and said no way

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,720
javascript is ugly it's slow it's

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,400
useless it's not even a real language

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,739
it's just wrong in so many ways and yes

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,530
if if you look at the language it it is

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,750
wrong I mean there's no question about

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,790
it there's some so much bad that went

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,620
into the language

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,860
for heaven's sake it was designed for

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,500
during an eleven day period where

00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,930
Brandon I said I had to do this really

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,600
really fast otherwise someone else would

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,790
have

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,830
well the slow part at this point has

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:12,780
been taken care of in 2008 we saw the

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:14,950
release of v8 for chrome an entirely new

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,500
JavaScript engine that did the

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:20,560
impossible it handled just-in-time

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,050
compilation for this dynamics correcting

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,070
scripting language it did in line in

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:30,160
line in caching and so on so these guys

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:32,620
led by Lars bak a Danish guy who has a

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,500
history with small talk implementations

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,930
and they're just as impossible to make

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,860
fast and he did that too so they take

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:44,740
this really slow really crummy language

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:48,910
and and make it fast in some way a lot

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:52,210
of sort of dynamic measuring and jetting

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:54,130
and optimization going on there and soon

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,200
after that we saw new implementations of

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,120
JavaScript engines for Firefox and

00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,950
Internet Explorer with exactly the same

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,960
idea now that's not really the problem

00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,390
slow or fast

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,310
the real problem is deployment pretend

00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,600
that you were an evil overlord and you

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,570
want to take over the world

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,940
by whatever means possible and you want

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,660
everyone to use your own evil language

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,820
from AHA now the first problem is to

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,500
somehow get everyone to download this

00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,030
language to install it on their own

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,440
computer that's going to be a lot of

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:30,910
work now guess what every single web

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,669
browser currently deployed on a

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,310
computing device except links contains

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:39,280
the JavaScript engine a JavaScript

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,720
implementation if I were to guess just

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,270
from looking out here how many

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,560
JavaScript engines are currently in the

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:51,430
room I would guess well 3 figures at

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,440
least it's it's scary the language is

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,500
everywhere if you were stranded on a

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,700
desert island with just your mobile

00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,950
phone or your iPod

00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,050
whatever and you didn't have any

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:04,030
programming language installed on it you

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,920
would still be able to program happily

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,470
for the rest of your days or until the

00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,120
battery ran out at least because it

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,670
would have a JavaScript engine you could

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,950
program through the URL field in your

00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:19,990
browser and there's lots of computing

00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,700
devices there's desktop computers the

00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,310
smart phones there's notebooks there's

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,990
tablets as TVs I wouldn't be entirely

00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,090
surprised if there were fridges and

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,490
vacuum cleaners and dish forces out

00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,800
there with with a JavaScript engine in

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,730
them

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,500
javascript is winning by ubiquity it's

00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:44,710
everywhere because we like to watch

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:46,570
kittens on the web and people do weird

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,490
things with it I mean in the POE

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,830
community would like to sometimes golf

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:54,130
programs for fun sort of see who gets

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,870
away with typing the least keys least

00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,120
amount of keystrokes to achieve a

00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:01,620
certain goal in JavaScript they do this

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,880
sort of as regular day to day business

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,190
just because there's a tube going

00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,780
between the server and the client which

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:11,020
you have to be careful with not to send

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,850
too much traffic that so not only do we

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,310
produce lots of JavaScript we produce

00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,020
lots of illegible JavaScript just

00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,870
crammed all together without the white

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,870
face and looking horrible now this trend

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:25,860
is is not incidental it's it's leading

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,990
the way in a certain direction

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,630
javascript is quickly becoming the

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,640
assembly language of the web and there

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,960
are a number of quotes here to sort of

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,940
back that up and people say different

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,320
things

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,120
assembly language of the web virtual

00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,560
machine of the web bytecode or the web

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,210
and so on it's the the fundamental thing

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,560
on the web anyway the thing we used to

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:53,680
run the web it's the substrate substrate

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,210
and people end up targeting JavaScript

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,010
in various ways if they don't write

00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,020
directly in JavaScript which many still

00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:02,050
do they have some other language which

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:05,080
they just trans compile into JavaScript

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:08,139
so javascript is the sort of target

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,909
format here in the bytecode format

00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:14,229
and here's a quote from Eric Maher and

00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:17,189
again it doesn't matter whether we call

00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:20,189
it assembly language or byte code or

00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:24,370
make it parallel to P code with pascal's

00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:26,199
compilers or compared to the JVM you

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,110
know Java was intended to fill this role

00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,330
for the web we would have HTML and CSS

00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,789
and then we would have Java applets and

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,409
things like that but it turns out that

00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:37,240
everyone hated Java applets they were

00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,279
just sitting there looking more rows in

00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,510
their own little rectangle on the page

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,550
and no one really liked that and so

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:49,720
JavaScript took over instead as this

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:51,820
dynamic HTML thing and his dog is

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,529
Crockford weighing in on the same thing

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,260
no it's it's not an assembly language

00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:58,779
it's it's actually the VM it doesn't

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:03,070
really matter it sits down there sort of

00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:05,350
at the foundation it's working so well

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,550
that we see projects like google web web

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,370
toolkit

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:12,730
it's a toolkit that compiles Java to

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:14,500
JavaScript that's that's just crazy so

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,240
you write your entire application in

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,370
Java and pretend JavaScript it's not

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,709
there but it is there everything gets

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,600
compiled to it we have things like

00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:25,149
CoffeeScript where people say okay we

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,890
learned a bunch of things about

00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,779
JavaScript now we know better let's make

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,850
a better JavaScript and so you write

00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:32,920
everything in CoffeeScript instead and

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,570
life is beautiful until you get an error

00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,579
message and you have to debug the

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,769
JavaScript code but people still do this

00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:40,529
I won't disparage it in any way it's

00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:44,320
becoming more and more of a viable

00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:46,269
programming methodology I know lots of

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,790
mature companies using CoffeeScript

00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:50,529
today and with source mapping you will

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,370
actually get your errors in your

00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:56,910
original source code as well

00:09:53,370 --> 00:10:00,640
we have weird and crazy things like

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:04,029
asm.js which takes JavaScript and says

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:08,140
okay this this was slow at least until

00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:10,570
v8 and chrome but we can make it machine

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,910
fast we can sort of connect it tie it

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,680
down to the machine layer and make it

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:17,290
really really fast so you take the

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,100
original JavaScript and you you just do

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,709
a

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,829
number of weird syntactic things with it

00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:26,170
saying okay let's bit or this with a

00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:27,850
zero so now we suddenly know it's an

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:30,160
integer we type it as an integer so

00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,250
without changing the language at all you

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,579
get a faster language by using a similar

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,649
TAS and well browsers are quickly

00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:40,959
catching up then the thing that will

00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:44,589
happen in the summer is that we'll get

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,839
an even faster engine for Mozilla

00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:50,740
Firefox for example this coding monkey

00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:56,470
is an optimization module for oirase and

00:10:50,740 --> 00:11:01,779
TAS we have things like M scripting with

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:04,660
which takes LLVM virtual machine

00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:08,560
bytecode format and again compiles it to

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:10,449
JavaScript and people are doing awesome

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:16,089
things with this as well have you seen

00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:17,079
the 3d demo with with the 3d rendering

00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,889
engine

00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:22,600
it's the Unreal Engine right just

00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:27,480
running natively on in the browser

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:30,279
that's fantastic but that's just the web

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,910
the the genie is still in the box

00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:35,620
we we have JavaScript has spread all

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,750
over the web and all over our web

00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,399
clients and so on surely JavaScript

00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,430
won't take over the world just by

00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:45,040
completely dominating the web I mean the

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:51,130
web is just this small thing without any

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,899
practical value right well we have these

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,699
various things where javascript is

00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:56,860
currently leaking out into other

00:11:54,699 --> 00:12:00,990
different technologies many of them on

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:03,579
on the desktop so Dashboard widgets

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:06,130
Adobe AIR which is basically saying okay

00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:09,850
let's let's build desktop clients but

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:13,540
with JavaScript technology your script

00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:17,170
various various programs like Photoshop

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:19,449
and illustrator there's a lot of mobile

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,910
development going on with JavaScript and

00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:24,339
this is basically people's way to avoid

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:27,100
programming for each individual platform

00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:29,170
like Android and iOS and so on you just

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,670
write a JavaScript web application

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,460
and you get that for

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:35,800
independence in some sense even Windows

00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:40,570
8 apps exist now which you can write

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:42,880
either in C++ or in JavaScript so it's

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:46,630
definitely leaking outside of the web as

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,880
well and it's doing this fast we even

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,100
get JavaScript as an entire operating

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,690
system imagine that sort of going from

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:58,260
this silly butterflies things back in

00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:03,390
95-98 to actually powering the entire

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:03,390
operating system that's kind of scary

00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,950
what's going on here is really an

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,780
instance of Edwards law which says that

00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,120
any application that can be written in

00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:16,930
JavaScript will eventually be written in

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,360
JavaScript I mean look at Google Docs

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:22,960
look at Google Maps this is just lifting

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:31,980
what used to be awesome desktop

00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:31,980
applications up to the web instead yes

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:41,230
there you go

00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:43,800
this explains a lot engi another case in

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,660
point git is also very popular now

00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,220
someone proposed a Kickstarter project

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,440
saying I want to build a JavaScript

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,780
engine that allows you to get in the

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,430
browser Wow get in the browser

00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:58,120
apparently more people in than I said

00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:01,690
Wow because it was funded in 28 hours it

00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,640
reached this goal and I swear if I had

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:07,060
seen it in time I would have founded it

00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,130
too so this is these are the forces in

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:12,100
play just putting dumping everything

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:14,680
that we know and care about on the

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:19,000
browser or on the web or using some kind

00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:21,430
of JavaScript technology to power it we

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,560
have no js' in case you weren't

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,750
satisfied to write just on the client

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,660
you can now write JavaScript both on the

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:31,660
client and on the server that's kind of

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,700
Awesome and there's a lot of async

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:38,800
goodness going on there and there are

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:41,200
entire web stacks now on top of node.js

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,990
for example meteor which has a really

00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,790
nice demo on their home

00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,399
if you haven't seen that I don't have

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,290
time to show it in the talk but it's

00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,690
it's awesome what you can suddenly do

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,550
you get this really really nice tie

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,500
between the client and the server

00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,230
mostly because now they're both running

00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,610
JavaScript you see here how we

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:03,300
step-by-step excepting JavaScript more

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:05,670
and more into our lives but isn't Perl 6

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,490
the future i mean i'm i generally up

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:11,580
here talking about politics and i I feel

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:14,310
kind of strange standing here saying

00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:18,089
well JavaScript has already won and I

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:21,980
would like to say yes Perl 6 of course

00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:25,440
will win as well Perl 6 is the future

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:28,320
but it will win by targeting JavaScript

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,300
as well there's currently a google

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,560
Summer of Code project which was

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,209
accepted only a week ago or so by power

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,860
maria's and he's building a recruiter

00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:41,520
back-end for JavaScript so we will have

00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,260
not just the JVM more and Parrott we

00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,010
will also have a JavaScript back-end

00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:49,230
which means that a project like try Ruby

00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:51,839
or try pogs like we had should be super

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:54,240
easy to get and you can suddenly run

00:15:51,839 --> 00:16:01,020
Java Perl 6 in the browser yes you have

00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:04,829
a question that it's a JavaScript back

00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:13,500
in for a CUDA so you write your Perl 6

00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:16,260
but it compiles into JavaScript yes

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,029
that's opposite I this must have been

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:21,660
one of the I'm really tired it's almost

00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:24,540
midnight lights thank you it will run on

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:30,329
JavaScript yes it will be post and run

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:34,200
on JavaScript absolutely we needed both

00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:35,910
ways to survive yeah yeah they're even

00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,860
fixing the language itself and without

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,250
breaking the web this is the awesome

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:43,709
thing I was amazed when I realized what

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,390
ACMA script 5 was when it came out by

00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:47,040
the way we always say ACMA script when

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,660
we're talking about the spec it's a

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,470
horrible name but that's what language

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:55,290
actually is called and they even they

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,790
even stole the use strict from from Perl

00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,319
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,850
but they have to put it in quotes in

00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:03,609
order to be backwards compatible but

00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:07,990
it's obviously a straight borrow from

00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:10,449
from the poll idea there and if you

00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:12,699
thought Atmos Group 5 was awesome like I

00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:15,159
did with the lots of fixes to the

00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:17,769
language and and lots of improvement to

00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:19,329
the object model and so on just look at

00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:22,750
what they're doing with the next version

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:26,889
with Eknath group 6 or es next or yes

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,779
harmony that's even awesomer and so they

00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:31,450
actually have a process where they're

00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:34,870
able to improve and evolve the language

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,700
and that's not a guarantee that's not

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,409
something you get for free they they've

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,360
worked really hard to do this they're

00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:42,760
doing most of the improvements and sort

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,649
of testing of ideas in a bootstrap

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:48,539
JavaScript engine so they're just

00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:51,429
evolving the language written in itself

00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:52,450
so javascript has all it takes to

00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:55,240
survive anything

00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,460
it's like cockroaches or it's like sand

00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,679
on the beach it gets in your sandals it

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,049
runs everywhere it's fast it's a de

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,210
facto standard and it's kind of bad

00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:07,659
originally but they're working on it and

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,669
improving it bit by bit so it's getting

00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:12,669
there as a pleasant language to work

00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:14,889
with directly and this is a slide board

00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:16,629
from Brendan I always bet on JavaScript

00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:18,460
they said it couldn't be fast they said

00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:21,039
it could be fixed they said couldn't do

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,379
multi-core GPUs they were wrong every

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,480
time my advice is always bet on

00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:27,909
JavaScript right I agree completely and

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,299
it's sort of up to us whether this is a

00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:33,789
utopic or dystopic view on the world you

00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:35,799
can't really stop javascript it's not

00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:38,169
about whether you like it or not it's

00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:41,830
about what will survive when everything

00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:45,190
changes around it and my bet people will

00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:49,110
keep looking at kittens javascript has

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,110
already won thank you

00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:03,890
maybe they're under lords there at the

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,930
foundation of everything yes I believe I

00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:09,190
have a minute of questions or so are

00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,190
there any questions from the audience

00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:18,910
yes I will repeat the question

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,870
nice okay so apparently there are even

00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,610
more environments that target JavaScript

00:19:49,870 --> 00:20:02,679
than I was aware and I would just like

00:19:51,610 --> 00:20:04,900
to show you let's see languages that

00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:07,059
compiled to JavaScript let's see if I

00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,830
have an internet connection yes list of

00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:13,570
languages that compile to Jas

00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:17,490
this is a bloody long list and we even

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:20,290
have Perla it's in there somewhere

00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:22,240
yes / Leto is mentioned as one of the

00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:24,220
projects here I bet there are more

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:37,929
languages like we could answer this list

00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:43,870
yes Stefan there's JavaScript in a

00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:46,120
telescope wonderful in space there you

00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,490
go javascript is already in space it has
