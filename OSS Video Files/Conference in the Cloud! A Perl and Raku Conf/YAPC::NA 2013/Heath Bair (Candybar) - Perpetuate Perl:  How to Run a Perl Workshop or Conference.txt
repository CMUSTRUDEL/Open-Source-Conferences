00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:30,599
a team you have an idea you have a

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:31,920
vision and you're just awesome right so

00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,690
you've got you've got a bunch of guys

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,489
you go out you drink coffee you drink

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,569
beer or whatever you're talking about

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,060
how great would be to run a workshop

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:40,739
right there's your team you say you know

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,840
what we love our dream no stuff we want

00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,549
to run a pearl Arduino workshop right

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,230
there's your vision alright and then you

00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:50,280
just go out you do everything you can to

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:52,829
be as awesome as you can right great

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,980
place to start is your PM group so

00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:58,709
hopefully y'all here are in a PM group

00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:03,209
hopefully if you're not find one alright

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:04,650
your start one okay so this is the big

00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:07,769
this is the big one that I always have

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,269
is that you came up with the idea where

00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,500
you took it to your friends you know

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,780
like yeah let's do this workshop well

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,879
guess what you're the boss it was your

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,500
idea so you just basically you have to

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,370
step up and fess up the fact that you're

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:25,350
now in charge so get over it right okay

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:30,930
envision your vision what do you want to

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:33,090
do okay fine so even how about idea of

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,549
what you want to do you want to do a

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,930
hardware workshop right so you you see

00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,000
if you get this picture in your mind you

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,410
know exactly what you want to do how big

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,470
do you want it you only want ten people

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,030
what happens at fifty people show up

00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,160
okay or you really want a hundred but

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,650
what happens if ten show up right so get

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,660
an idea of how many people you want how

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,579
much will it cost is gonna be free or

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,239
you gonna charge for it and what do you

00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:59,359
want people to learn okay then down here

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,769
do you really know what you're doing

00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:10,880
okay all right so yeah yeah exactly

00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:10,880
think about that a few times okay money

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,810
what else there is to say you know TPF

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,430
will help bootstrap you will help find

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,459
you if you need it if you don't

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:23,430
fantastic okay how are you going to

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,050
charge how are you going to collect are

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,710
you gonna use paypal are you get people

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,250
going to walk in

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,319
of cash and hand you cash right do you

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,060
need sponsorship do you need companies

00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,949
you could say you know what i'll give

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,160
you a thousand bucks to run this just

00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:39,139
make sure that my name is someplace and

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,949
then how do you going to pay your bills

00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:44,160
those are the things that you need to

00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:48,500
think about now this is the one thing

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,360
that dan always hype harps on if TPF

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,039
under rights you if we bootstrap you we

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,080
underwrite you we help collect the money

00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,860
for your workshop or your conference or

00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,470
whatever we hold the money you guys

00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,500
don't get the money alright so we hold

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,820
whatever money is made and that will we

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,530
could use that again if you want to run

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,599
another workshop you can use that money

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,060
as what bootstraps you again right so

00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:13,530
you can bootstrap you first you make a

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,810
bunch of money we keep it we give it

00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:26,120
back to you to do it again or it gets

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:26,120
used for other workers correct all right

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:33,150
so you have a great location actually

00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,370
let's say you have two great locations

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:39,810
right how do you know which one's better

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:48,240
all right so cost versus service maybe

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:49,680
one yeah absolutely and I tell you what

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,360
let me blow through some of my slides

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,720
we'll hit that but it's usually if you

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,639
can bundle like um get a hotel we

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,380
promise to bring you 50 rooms with those

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,410
50 rooms we promise to spend three

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,449
thousand dollars in food so 3050 rooms

00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,210
how about you compass a room so we can

00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:07,500
ever come right so you start to bundle

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:24,419
things together and you're fun did you

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:26,970
get better deals all right don't be

00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:28,410
afraid to ask for a discount dealer they

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,210
gave a new price that isn't the price

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,510
ask for twenty percent off at four

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,770
twenty-five percent look if you a just

00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,770
and also one more thing to realize is

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:40,200
that TPF is a nonprofit organization so

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,599
we can actually file so we don't pay the

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:47,039
tax okay so that will save you money as

00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:48,360
well oh yeah so we try to every state we

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,620
go to with the gaps if we make sure that

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,990
were registered thats it is a non-profit

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,430
okay snacks and foods right do you are

00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,570
you going to serve any food are you

00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,760
going to serve coffee and make your

00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,020
people happy now what are you gonna do

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,280
with all the leftover food you're gonna

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,180
have a lot of leftover food we're going

00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,020
to do it that you can take it home

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,510
you're going to give it to the homeless

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,310
what you're gonna do with it all right

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,199
you also need to know when you have to

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,330
turn in your final food count numbers

00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,770
right so you can say hey you know we're

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,560
going to do this next Wednesday in there

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:19,320
like now we needed to know a month ago

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,090
how many people we have to feed and can

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,740
you bring food into locations a lot of

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,900
locations will not let you bring in food

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,900
they want you to use their food services

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,039
okay so random thoughts you're playing a

00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:35,039
morning coffee break everybody loves

00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,870
coffee um pro people love coffee more

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,099
than breakfast so if you're gonna spend

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,360
money on something in the morning you

00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,130
spend it on coffee you don't spend it on

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,710
breakfast

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:46,260
all right plan for afternoon water and

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,940
soda breaks and people usually drink

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,400
about two drinks in the afternoon so

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:58,950
that kind of gives you some rough food

00:07:50,400 --> 00:08:01,500
ideas all right try to run your workshop

00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:03,930
or your conference to not make money try

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,220
to run a break even right we're not here

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,900
to be rich we're here to make pearl

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:14,670
awesome ok so you budget yourself to

00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:17,790
break even ok decide if you're going to

00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:19,020
have early bird or late fees or you're

00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,840
just going to go with the flat fee or is

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:25,920
going to be free but expect the

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:30,450
unexpected venues like this have hidden

00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,400
fees and you can go over it a million

00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,690
times you don't know about it but I tell

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,890
you about conference is over and all of

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:39,870
a sudden now you get a ten thousand

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:42,539
dollar bill you didn't know about so and

00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,830
frankly good flavor well sure if they

00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,990
give you a charge you don't know about

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:49,050
vitamin cuz half the time to at least

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,660
reduce it if not as long as you're

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:55,440
really good fight nobody fight bill just

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:57,420
you know they'll be happy yep ok so how

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,280
do you recruit speakers well what's your

00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,480
theme what's your idea you're going to

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,000
do our dueno stuff well then you

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,960

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:10,140

hundred-thousand-dollar conference

Yap see and with a hundred people here

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:05,100
you're not covering your costs right we

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,240
get to realize that most people will

00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:14,940
register almost at the end right yeah

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:18,290

registrations for great rainy bottling

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,890
dozens of tickets in one shot because

00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:28,649
some of those spikes look very unnatural

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:31,709
okay so I know what this spike here is

00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:33,360
alright that spike there is hey you know

00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,470
we've accepted all these talks let's

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,130
make sure the speakers have a free

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:40,320
ticket so that's what this one here is

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,750
but there's plenty of others in here

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,829
that are people like oh my god I got emd

00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,870
gaps you got to get there guy to get

00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:49,380
there right there's one more vertical

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:52,940
spike yeah i'll have to ask of us but

00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:59,250
this one here so jumped what about 100

00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:00,810
maybe yeah what's up yeah that might

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,149
have been it might have been the end of

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:06,329
early early or late fees maybe they'll

00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:09,360
relate fuse right center but this kind

00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:11,120
of gives you an idea along what you just

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,860
got to kind of roll with it sometimes

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:19,649
all right running a gap see is awesome

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,300
it will probably be the hardest thing

00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:23,459
did you ever do in your entire life all

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:29,550
right and it will almost kill you but it

00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:32,980
is awesome okay you need to plan for

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:36,020
four to five hundred people

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,120
and then my loss my Bold again all right

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,270
you will be spending a hundred thousand

00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,680
dollars so you need to plan for the 8020

00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,570
rule which is eighty thousand and

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,000
sponsorship and twenty thousand and

00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:50,690
registration this year I think we had

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,430
about thirty thousand of registration so

00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,220
i think i think the budget i think he

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,130
had about 110 112 thousand dollars is

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:07,370
what he brought in he's spending about

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:11,780
105,000 all right you can run exe but it

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:16,390
is hard okay but there are a lot of us

00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:18,500
JT myself dan if there's a look yes

00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,480
there are a lot of us who want to help

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,610
you a lot of us has been there we've run

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,900
conferences we've run workshops we know

00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:33,800
what we know what to do we know how to

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:36,230
help okay we need we need new people we

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,930
need fresh ideas we need new cities we

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:40,160
need new locations we need people

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,380
they're going to be willing to step up

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,750
and say you know what I want to do a gap

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,520
see this is awesome and I once in a

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,660
third be taught you know I want to be

00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,840
the one that saves on stage everybody

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:53,000
claps for me because pearl is awesome so

00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,680
we need you guys I know it's kind of

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,660
scary and I know it's kind of hard but

00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,970
if you plan five years out if you say

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,030
you know what 2020 I'm going to bring it

00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:05,300
to Cambridge or I'm going to bring it to

00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:08,000
your city right you can start doing that

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,760
you can start looking for open source

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,500
clubs or student organizations or

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,670
universities or you can start looking

00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:21,080
for places where you can run at UFC all

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:23,720
right so to conclude you can run a

00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,150
workshop a conference okay it's very

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,240
rewarding for you and the people that

00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:34,250
show up but just remember right okay oh

00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,270
god it is awesome alright so I know he

00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:39,370
had a question I think I kind of

00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:41,120
answered it looking for other questions

00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,680
yeah

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,260
define kind of the difference between

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,700
like a workshop or conference would be

00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,589
like some conferences I kind of

00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,470
understand that like a workshop is that

00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:56,420
more of like you go and hands on your

00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:58,190
programming no so what do you want to do

00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,870
do you want your conference being mini

00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,250
Yap see do you want to have a couple of

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,350
speakers come in and talk about a couple

00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,660
of cool things do you want to run a

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,010
hackathon all right so you want to sit

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,870
there you're coding all day and half on

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,360
some cool model Desmond touched in 10

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,400
years or do you want to run a small gap

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:19,370
see a small comment you got to decide

00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:23,720
what you want to do yeah in the same

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:25,790
cities retention hago twice on in

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:32,870
Pittsburgh Pittsburgh twice three times

00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:37,490
no x 3 x sorry just okay so yep c is to

00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:39,140
energize the area so you want to travel

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,730
around as much as you can because you

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,880
want to go to places that they haven't

00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,589
touched pearl and forever or what

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,959
immunity that we want to prove to the

00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:49,279
communities that pearl is awesome we're

00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,279
still hearing is still breaking is

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,370
really fun and it's dirt cheap right so

00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:57,650
we want to go to new places lexington

00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,300
kentucky cleveland ohio game you know ha

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,790
let's let's go someplace to be on a

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:06,410
buncha before that's the concept fine y

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:08,690
axis fine well we can go get off there I

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,980
don't mind it all going out west we've

00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,800
always tried to stay the side of the

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:16,160
Mississippi but I mean we tried to stay

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,589
away from austin airport so but good i

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,410
mean now why not why not not released

00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:26,019
it's not an issue in no it's not as calm

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:39,040
has really not be that pearl eccentric

00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:44,399
yeah how's the world the same yeah yes

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:47,379
let's thing didn't plug my power yeah I

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,660
imagine we have a framework for doing a

00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:53,079
one and a half day workshop but there's

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:55,119
not really like brand new people that I

00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:57,100
know we would love to afford to other

00:15:55,119 --> 00:16:00,339
languages available early to me in

00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,709
Python now okay and the impact that it

00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:06,100
had on the bottom python meetup was that

00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:08,259
we went from like 12 just hundred people

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,699
on our mailing list you about 3,200

00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:13,209
people on our mailing list for the

00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:14,739
Boston area also just kind of like

00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:17,019
running the workshops that people who

00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:19,809
came when some of them got moved into

00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:21,670
the regular easier but it was we're

00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:23,679
constantly saying we're open to new

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,319
people we like new people were feeling

00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,879
here we want people and still a lot of

00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,040
them had never gone through the workshop

00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:32,439
but really yeah I heard you guys were

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,179
cool we thought we would show up and so

00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:36,519
now we have this big group so we're

00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:38,920
trying to lick the Boston python meetup

00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:41,079
is looking at when can we host the big

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,050
pike on so i'll see if you feel like oh

00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:44,360
there's not

00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:46,250
you're from one recruit you could use

00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,670
smaller events to what absolute up your

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:51,589
group first and all that stuff is cc'd

00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:55,250
and I'd love to help anyone wanted to

00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:57,680
port it to prom cool anybody else have

00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:01,130
any questions run a workshop crazy

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,839
people to run Yap see anything reference

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:05,720
I making workshops have your bin and

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:14,480
where they're confused well yeah frozen

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:18,339
perl / l'oasis ppw you know you don't

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:29,360
Baltimore together the DC / workshop

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:32,300
yeah okay so I learned to always read

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,860
the writers okay so there are people in

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,110
our pearl community that still carry a

00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,610
writer you know what a writer is so if

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,290
you bring Britney Spears over to your

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,450
house for a cool party she's presenting

00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,130
a riot or he tell you that she wants

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,800
green Eminem's that she wants whatever

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,800
okay there are people in our community

00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,390
that's still carry writers all right and

00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,419
I kind of wish that they didn't because

00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:56,600
it seems a little look too much like yes

00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:58,669
a little diva-ish so yeah obviously

00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,990
doing the things always bit me is you

00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:02,809
have read your contracts you got to know

00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:05,690
what you're doing cold be willing to

00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:08,210
cold call people be willing to try to go

00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,410
out look for money right reach out to

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,600
everybody that you possibly can you

00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:14,270
realize you're gonna be shut down call

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,530
the eighty percent of the time right so

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:20,540
I think I read some my phone conferences

00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:23,520
as a clash of speakers that were there

00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:25,870
as you're really from

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,230
place because I don't like you tell her

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,230
yeah

00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,640
alright so what other crazy non-crazy

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,169
what other interesting what other

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,850
questions you got for me and you always

00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:04,820
find me later buy me a beer ask me

00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:08,780
wherever you want yes for location

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:11,270
selection I've noticed a lot of the pro

00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:14,750
conferences are in medium-sized City

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:17,480
never in psycho huge metropolis is there

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:20,270
a reason for that pillar is it possible

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,179
across rate here much cheaper quilt

00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:25,429
Chicago yeah doesn't doesn't make you my

00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:28,400
heart metropolis but something like Los

00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:30,590
Angeles or San Francisco know there's OS

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,990
Khan is held in I think Portland OR

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:35,809
somewhere else that's kind of a big

00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:38,780
metropolis but the absence themselves

00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:42,770
they're often held in these small states

00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:47,059
around the u.s. it's all about balls in

00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:48,590
lb / so it's true we are trying really

00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:52,130
hard to keep the appt see at one hundred

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:53,809
dollars okay and to do that we have the

00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,179
plaster the back of t-shirts with

00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:58,970
sponsors because we're trying to keep it

00:19:56,179 --> 00:20:00,860
at 100 bucks if we move into a big city

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,539
we have to raise you have to raise the

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,970
registration costs and you're going to

00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:06,980
lose people and or you're gonna have to

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,620
find massive amounts of sponsorship to

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:12,320
cover it so like I said it it serves

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:15,100
your location versus cost how you

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,100
determine your location

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,789
allow you to have the event but to be a

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:30,220
in-kind sponsor like where they charge

00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:32,679
you maybe just clean vacuum at the end

00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,150
but give you all the rooms for free but

00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,850
you might have to work with them and do

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:39,880
it during their spring break but it

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:43,210
requires an end you have to have and in

00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,730
like four columbus yap see we which the

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:48,549
open-source club and they submitted our

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,320
bid to the university right so because

00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:52,570
they did that we got the student rates

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,570
we got all of these student pluses

00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:58,120
because they submitted so you have to

00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:00,070
know that a non-profit or internal rate

00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:04,900
not that cost plus reviews for

00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:06,760
for-profit events credit yes a lot of

00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,289
our rooms were free because this the

00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,730
student organizations submitted it for

00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:16,650
safety how about purity not the austin

00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,650
was there a group that gave you

00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:25,299
ok so the original bit here was through

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,710
the Austin / longer group and that was I

00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:29,929
don't know truth y'all have talked to

00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:32,420
Todd or yelps talk to will he will on

00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:34,640
top of one's put together I bet you will

00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,760
use somebody or had it in here did you

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,070
give it to university don't say another

00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:42,170
if its image on topic you can ask

00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:44,780
someone in the cs department to speak at

00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:48,670
your event and then they might push up

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,670
yep so if you can find someone

00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:53,980
yeah and the one thing I just forgot

00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:55,450
about the one most important thing is

00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,129
it's always allow your students to come

00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,960
free if you have kids that are a

00:21:57,129 --> 00:22:01,419
university that are close you have young

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,509
kids movie in high school give them a

00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:06,870
free pass find a way to cover the cost

00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:09,509
but get them there right if there's a

00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:12,490
some universities like Madison have a

00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:14,769
what's called an extension center or an

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,710
outreach center it's designed to bring

00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:19,570
in businesses and nonprofits to to the

00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,519
University then you don't need the in

00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,009
you can actually go to that or knowledge

00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,169
and if it exists not all universities

00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,059
have that but if you look it'll either

00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:30,610
be called extension university extension

00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:32,590
