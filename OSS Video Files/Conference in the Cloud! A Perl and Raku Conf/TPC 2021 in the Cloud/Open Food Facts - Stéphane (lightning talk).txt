okay thank you hi everyone i'm stefan

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,120
i'm the founder of open footage

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,240
i'm going to just introduce the project

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,240
in a minute

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,799
and uh tell you about what we use uh

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,240
pearl for the challenges we face and uh

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,240
how the cold foundation and how it

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,530
actually are helping us to face some of

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,240
them

00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,720
[Music]

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,680
so this is what you see in a shop and if

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,800
i ask you to

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,680
pick the lcs food what you would have to

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,400
do is to turn

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,960
all those packages and read all the fine

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,040
prints and take notes and compare and

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,079
it's going to take a lot of time so

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,559
that's why we thought

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,680
let's take all these data and put this

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,320
into a kind of

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,840
wikipedia for food products so we made a

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,160
mobile app to scan

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,200
barcodes and people can take pictures of

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,480
products

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,800
and so fast forward eight years

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,000
nine years we have close to two million

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,680
food products in

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,680
you know a database of food products

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,840
and of course when you have products in

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,039
a food database then you can do a lot of

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,879
cool things with

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,040
cars and etc one thing we do as well

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,119
there is also a mobile application

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,640
where you can scan backwards and then

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,240
from from the ingredients from the

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,200
nutrition facts table

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,320
we compute a lot of indicators to see is

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,360
the product

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,680
of good nutritional quality how

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,040
processed is it what about the

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,680
environmental impact

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,520
is it vegetarian vegan etc so there are

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,560
lots of things lots of reasons to get

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,560
interested in the food

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,880
so we we really modeled our project

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,159
after wikipedia so we copied the whole

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,000
idea of wikipedia

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,600
approach code source project

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,680
collaborative project

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,720
we are a nonprofit independent from the

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,200
food industry

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,640
and everything we do is open source and

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,040
all the data that we collect

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,640
is uh is in open data so anyone can use

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,479
it for any purpose

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,880
and we are very happy that yeah we have

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,119
seen tons of reuses of the data you know

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,799
lots of different mobile applications

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,799
for tons of different people

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,320
and also something i'm very proud of

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,399
that the community is very proud of

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,800
that we have we have a lot of scientists

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,520
that are reuses that are reused

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,319
using the data for the service of papers

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,319
so what we use gold for well i love

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,560
pearls so i try to use

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,400
for everything in the project and we use

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,200
it for almost everything so

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,239
we have a web front end uh we have an

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,239
api server

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,879
and that doesn't that also search an

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,640
aggregation we do a lot of analysis of

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,160
the data so one thing for instance is

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,840
taking the list of ingredients

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,360
and trying to cut it into all the

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,879
individual intelligence but there are

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,720
many more things that we do with the

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,040
data and

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,800
for the back end we use a mogul db which

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,640
is an audio sql database

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,920
and i like it a lot because i can take

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,480
all my pearl

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,200
ashties or flashes or fares and just put

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,040
that into json into the mongodb database

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,400
and then retrieve back later

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,400
so that's uh that's really nice um

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,680
one word on just one example of what we

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,800
do with the data is this this

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,920
indentation

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,200
so we we have a list of ingredients in

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,760
any languages

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,040
and we want to really uh extract those

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
individual ingredients

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,480
so that we can compute if a product is

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,920
vegan for instance

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,560
so that we can detect all the food

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,360
additives all the allergens

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,840
and to do that we have a kind of big

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,239
tree

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,040
of thousands of ingredients that we

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,959
created

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,760
with synonyms and in

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,840
in translations in almost all languages

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,120
and then we try to pass all that and uh

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,799
it's um

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,400
it's quite a fun task don't think

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,959
especially to do that in all the

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,159
languages

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,560
so in terms of challenges i wish it was

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,280
as nice as this slide that i showed you

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,920
earlier but the reality is that uh

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,640
everything is kind of mixed together

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,200
it's

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,200
really fine food so i we have one code

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,680
base that does a lot of things

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,439
uh together and that's because it over

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,920
over time

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,319
so one one thing is that we still use

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,640
modburn for instance

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,360
and we have a very hard time to attract

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,680
new developers and newcomers

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,079
and that's where we were very happy when

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,799
uh michael two from the pearl foundation

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,479
um told us we could uh have an outreach

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,160
here in turn to help us

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,440
so we worked on improving how to set up

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,240
the

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,320
project as a big part of the work was to

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,600
use template toolkit to get rid of all

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,600
the html tags for

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,639
in the code and put it into templates

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,880
and now we're working on

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,759
refactoring to really separate all the

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,240
components

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,919
of the tool so we did a lot of progress

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
thanks to the interns but there's still

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,680
a lot to be done

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,440
um so i'm very much hoping that some of

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,240
you may be uh willing to

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,280
to help us so if you are please feel

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,400
free to join uh

00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:04,160
to talk to me in or to catch me

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:04,160
