so yeah my name is mark gardner uh i've

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,680
uh

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:11,120
been blogging about pearl uh

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,320
weekly since uh sometime in february

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,160
this year

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,560
uh it's kind of a thing that i uh

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,400
got started with a mentor of mine he

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,080
suggested i start this

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,359
and i wanted to talk about how

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,480
you too can do the same thing so

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,559
first step in this is to get a blog now

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,200
there are a couple ways to do this

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,920
um if you want to go with a fairly

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,040
standardized layout blogs.perl.org is a

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,399
nice place

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,760
uh and aggregates a lot of uh pro

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,600
blogs um there's also a small but

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,360
growing community of pearl bloggers

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,360
on the site dev.t.o

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,239
d-zone is another option for you as well

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,079
they have a moderation thing they act

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,640
more like a publication where

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,000
uh you have to submit your articles for

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,520
moderation before they're

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,760
published but uh they have uh

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,520
caught a couple of issues on mine so you

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,640
know there's value there

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,080
and there's medium which

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,280
is another blogging

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,200
writing site it has a really nice

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,439
interface for typing in your articles

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,040
if you want to do more customization you

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,200
can

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,720
if you want a blog to reflect your

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,680
uh your own tastes your own look

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,720
wordpress is a piece of software but

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,159
they also have

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,840
a site at wordpress.com where you can

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,920
host your own blog

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,560
um you can host a blog on github

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,960
if you're already if you've already got

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,720
a

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,280
programming project on github it's

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,399
fairly easy to get that set up

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,759
or your preferred hosting provider um

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,439
i use hostgator but uh anyone will do it

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,479
helps if they have some sort of ready to

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,599
go blogging application like wordpress

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,800
one thing i'll point out is that

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,959
no customization is okay because

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,319
uh you end up spending more time in

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,360
writing and less time

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:25,360
fiddling with templates and software um

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,720
which if you're into that i mean some

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,120
some people end up

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,360
uh that's that's their project

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,800
constantly working on their blogs

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,160
um and also i'll point out github pages

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,200
is uh for static non-database-backed

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,840
sites

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,319
and uh tends to require a bit more setup

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,560
including generator software so

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,480
again if you like fiddling with things

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,200
uh go with the stuff on the right-hand

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,920
column

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,360
if you just want to get writing go with

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,360
the stuff on the left hand column

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,599
second step write things

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,159
first thing to do is find a topic uh you

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,239
know

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,680
face with a blank page it can be

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,599
intimidating but

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,760
hey we're all here uh talking about

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,560
pearl so hey blog about pearl

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,720
uh there's the pearl weekly challenge

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,720
that

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,080
gets publicized every week in the pearl

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,440

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,799
or what you'd like to work on

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,560
if what you're working on isn't terribly

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,720
inspiring

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,840
blog about your favorite perl module or

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,680
feature

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,200
i've i've done that i've done surveys of

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,159
features that i liked and

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,080
across uh pearl versions as well and

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,760
most importantly it doesn't matter

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,439
if somebody else wrote about it you have

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,680
a unique perspective

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,239
uh you can even write about your

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,879
reaction to other people's posts

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,159
uh the other step about writing give it

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,080
a title and this is

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,560
uh uh brought up a little bit with uh

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,159
some

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,920
some issues with the pearl weekly

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,959
challenge uh sometimes

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,600
when we're publishing that in pro weekly

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,799
uh the titles are just solution to this

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,759
solution to that

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,040
um be a little inventive here you can be

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,240
a little click-baity but

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,960
honest um most importantly mention

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,520
pearl this this might be hard

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,120
but it does help it does help with

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,560
search engines it does help with

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,240
uh increasing pearls rank

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,520
uh in google uh and lastly write about

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,840
whatever you've got

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,080
uh length doesn't matter you don't have

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,680
to write long essays or whatever one or

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,479
two paragraphs is fine

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,479
anything longer than a tweet that's fine

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,560
step three promotion uh there are lots

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,000
of places to promote

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,160
your blog there's twitter um

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,639
there's facebook and facebook groups we

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,320
have a couple of facebook groups uh

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,680
devoted to pearl there's the pearl

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,240

facebook as well

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,520
linkedin is a good place for uh for

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,520
posting publicly

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,720
there are also linkedin groups uh

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,639

ide things like that uh and there are

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,759
also

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,280
uh i need to point out uh groups

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,039
that aren't related to pearl that you

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,759
should be promoting uh

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,680
such as uh free and open software groups

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,000
or generic programming groups

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,800
that leads me to reddit there is a lot

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,400
more

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,520

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,240
y combinator thing

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,680
uh lastly you can cross post on other

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,960
sites like the blogging sites i
