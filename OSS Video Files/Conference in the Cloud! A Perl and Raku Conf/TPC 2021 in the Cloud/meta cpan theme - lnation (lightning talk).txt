hi so today i'm going to talk about my

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,440
chrome and firefox extension messy pant

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,480
theme

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,160
so why did i do this uh well one day i

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,599
was bored and i decided let's do

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,920
something productive

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,560
and i found myself on messy pan webs

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,279
github page looking through the issues

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,119
and then i found this and i decided i

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,160
wanted this which was a

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,279
feature request for a dark mode theme

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,960
um and yeah so i decided to attempt it

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,399
and i built something not worked which

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,880
was important

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,320
uh so this is just some screenshots from

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,320
my first attempt

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,680
and this is a github merge request which

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,640
is still open but i'll get right into

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,239
that in a minute

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,480
so this started off quite simple we've

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,559
just css

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,760
for the dark mode theme and this is the

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,320
home screen

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,879
the recent screen uh a module view page

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
and the source code page when i got to

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,199
here i was like

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,039
well perhaps people are going to want

00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,600
custom syntax highlighting maybe they

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,280
want

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,199
a different color different shade of

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,199
black or different background color

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,280
so i decided to add options and then

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,320
options turn into more options

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,000
and yes this 100 works but

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,560
it wasn't going to get merged any time

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,799
soon and it still hasn't been merged

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,479
and it's been a couple of months so yeah

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,320
i so i had a new problem that i wanted

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,280
to solve i wanted this to work now and i

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,320
wanted it

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,840
yeah to work right now and that's where

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,360
i attempt to come in and that's the

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,680
browser extension

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,520
so what is a browser extension a browser

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,640
extension is something like a plugin for

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,240
your browser

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,920
that adds certain functions and pieces

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,840
to it for example extensions are used to

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,280
block ads on web pages translate text

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,439
from one language to another

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,680
or add pages to a third party bookmark

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,680
service or in our case it's simply to

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,159
change some css styles

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,880
uh so let's jump into a live demo so

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,119
before i

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,280
get interesting here this is on the

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,759
chrome web store and also on the firefox

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,159
app store and this has got mercy pad

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,000
open now so i'll just install this

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,680
and show you how quick and easy it is to

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,200
set up dark mode

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,200
uh so i'll pin

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,599
jump in i'll save our first theme as

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,599
light

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,480
for the default and then i'll save

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,319
another theme as dark

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,080
so we can switch between but what we can

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,560
do for dark is simply

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,239
change the bass scheme to dark mode and

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,640
that switches

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,239
the color scheme for pages uh we have

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,239
two other options here i'll quickly go

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,760
into we have solarize light

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,519
and we have solarized dark these are

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,760
just bass themes you can choose from but

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,000
for now we'll start from dark

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,920
and again if we go back here and we save

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,200
we can now easily switch between a light

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,120
and a dark mode

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,959
which i think is quite neat but maybe

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,040
you want to be a bit more adventurous so

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,760
maybe we want to change this to blue

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,160
and we can do that easily now and we can

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,080
just change a color here

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,840
like so and now we have a blue theme

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,720
and we hit save and that's the default

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,640
there but maybe

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,480
we'll go through some pages and we might

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,239
need to customize some other

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,080
features so like here the secondary

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,840
color i don't like too much so we can

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,640
change that to a

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,640
darker blue

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,440
like so and if i hit

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,879
save this is now persistent so if i when

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,159
i refresh

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,680
this will save each time um

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,959
there's lots of colors you can change

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,799
here i'm not going to go into all

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,480
because it takes quite some time

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,080
i'll just jump through them quickly like

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,159
you can change the navigation you can

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,239
change the side navigation colors

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,360
you can change the input you can change

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,319
buttons

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,120
links pagination uh syntax highlighting

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,000
i'll go into

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,159
because that's interesting i guess so

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,519
we'll just jump through into syntax

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,440
and maybe we want to change the white um

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,959
and we can do that easily just going

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,599
into syntax

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,599
plain color

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,080
maybe we change it to like a pink or

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,200
something i don't know

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
um but again this is persistent so i

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,680
save

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,400
and refresh and yeah it's it's there

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,280
the other feature of messi found theme

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,720
extension is

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,400
fonts so we can also change font styles

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,280
so we have two different font styles we

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,160
can change

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,199
the body font which is everything but

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,560
syntax

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,759
and then we have syntax font um

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,000
let's change that to something a bit

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,080
more funky we can also change font

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,919
size so we can make it much bigger

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,520
and again if i save this now this will

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,520
go throughout

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:49,280
final feature of this is you can export

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,040
and you can import so you can uh

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,400
transfer this across browsers so if

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,440
you've got if you've got chrome and

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,520
firefox

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,639
obviously you can't sync them but you

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,479
can

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,280
export import so like so so i can switch

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:08,880
between

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,880
