Description:
The Perl Foundation kicked off 2021 with a survey to find out how we - both the Perl Foundation and the broader Perl community - can make Perl more welcoming to beginners. In this talk we:
* Describe who responded to the survey.
* Summarise the types of support they need.
* Explain the work TPF is now undertaking to address these needs.
* Explain how you can help, and how the TPF can support you.

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,080
start

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:23,840
okay i'll wait people might still be

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,840
cooking dinner

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:57,280
okay i'll start hello everybody

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,760
uh welcome to my first summary for the

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,200
day of uh some work i've been doing with

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,040
the pearl foundation

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,360
and this one is what support do pearl

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,400
beginners need

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,599
okay so first let me tell you who i

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,680
am i'm andrew solomon

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,879
and my connection with pearl apart from

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,560
many years of writing pearl code is that

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,400
i provide pearl training

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,080
through geek uni it's my company where i

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,720
i um train people online

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:38,239
and mostly my my um

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,599
my students are in large companies yes

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,599
so that's

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,680
well why is it why is interesting for me

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,200
to learn what beginners need

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,239
so um a lot of the people that i teach

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,319
are in large companies i'm doing the

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,760
sort of ramp up into

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,360
what's poor compared to all the

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,840
languages they know before not

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,120
this not for people who are new to

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,959
programming

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,319
it's people who are familiar with

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,439
another language they want to learn

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,560
pearl

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,840
and um however there there is a

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,959
significant number not majority but

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,000
a number of trainees who are doing this

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,079
off their own but

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,359
on their own not in a large team

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,440
where they have uh people who are there

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,280
to give them instructions if

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,600
they're trying to do it all on a windows

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,160
box and they can't figure out why

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,520
the library path doesn't contain where

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,160
this code is

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,120
so um that's not the kind of thing that

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,400
i'm trying to teach

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,960
because i don't know the answers to that

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,600
myself and the question is

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,479
how can we as the pearl community

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,120
provide

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,840
support for people who are on their own

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,560
trying to

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,320
try to work this stuff out that's the

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,600
question i had

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,080
and so i um i went

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,240
to the pool foundation just because i

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,440
thought gee these guys must know how to

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,759
go about this

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,680
and i was proposing things like you know

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,800
should we put together a slight chat

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,400
and um provide support that way

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,919
and um stuart sort of is asking

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,759
questions and it

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,280
it turned out that i don't actually know

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,840
what the beginners

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,919
really want what they'd be comfortable

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,880
with in terms of the kind of support

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,240
so um so you figured out that the first

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,440
step would be to

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,400
to run a survey and we

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,960
in this case is a whole bunch of people

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,080
who

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,840
contributed lots of ideas and

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,120
directions on where to go with this

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,120
survey

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,680
so what did we do we put together this

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,120
survey

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,600
we sent around to all these interesting

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,440
places where we thought we might find

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,639
people new to pearl and

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,639
we asked them this question

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,840
and got 513 responses it's not a huge

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,479
number

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,000
but it's better than nothing and i know

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,400
for a fact that quite a lot of pole

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,639
people

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,919
i mean people need a pearl aren't

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,280
plugged into all these

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,639
community groups so um

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,280
so i feel lucky that we've got this many

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,280
responses

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,639
yeah there's some shocking news

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,120
um hands up if you are shocked

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,080
i can't i don't know i can count number

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,080
of people who do that but

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,319
okay

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,720
maybe i should yes thank you so

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,039
i suppose quite a lot of the people in

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,440
this meeting

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,080
have been in in the pearl world for over

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,800
10 years

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,920
because i think i'm realizing that that

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,160
is the majority of 12 developers

00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,520
[Music]

00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,240
this is the good news i think that

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,440
of the people who filled in the survey

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,440
more than the people

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,120
less than 10 years that the largest

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,280
group less than 10 years with the people

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,160
who've been doing it for

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,960
uh less than two years so my first

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,639
reading of this

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,960
is that uh we have more people coming

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,199
into the poll community

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,039
of course i know that some other people

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,280
going to look at this and think

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,720
well actually this is an indication that

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,039
they get a job

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,840
they're forced into doing perl and they

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,840
take off and find a python job somewhere

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,280
else or

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,520
java or windows knows what

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,199
maybe and we have to run this survey

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,639
again another few years

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,639
to see what the answer to this is

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:50,400
so then i

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,039
needed to nail down who

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,000
is fulfilling the survey because i don't

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,080
want to

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,280
pay much attention to the responses from

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,720
the people who say that they wouldn't

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,360
make any use

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,440
of support which you're offering them

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,560
okay

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,360
so the the bottom the bottom group i

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,199
basically pulled out all those results

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,120
before i tried to get some some

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,120
meaningful information from the survey

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,479
and unsurprisingly the people who've

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,599
been doing it for less than two years

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,800
desperately after some some help but

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,879
the people who've been doing it for more

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,399
than 10 years also need help and

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,159
to me this is i think that there'll be a

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,959
lot of people who are using pearl

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,240
in the same way that i use orc whenever

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,360
i go back to walk

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,560
i have to read a lot and um remind

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,600
myself of

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,680
uh the quirks and

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,120
also why i'm doing this instead of using

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,440
pearl so

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,800
um but i've been using it for a long

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,160
time and i think that there are still

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,800
quite a few people learning

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,800
using perl in that context

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,480
and this is how they label themselves

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,760
mostly developers it's a very general

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,440
term

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,240
but uh sort of

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,800
not exactly surprisingly a lot of the

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,480
the

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,680
thought of pearl as their hobby and

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,800
that's because i think it's a passion

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,720
and that's something we'll talk about

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,080
more in the next talk really but

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,120
um people use perl

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,720
logics they like it and that's

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,880
that's really positive response from the

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,839
survey then you've got sysadmins

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,680
devops and integration specialists

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,120
that's really interesting so

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,320
integration specialists are people who

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,320
do lots of um

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,959
lots of code to glue systems together

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,959
like you're you're providing

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,320
an advertising service for another

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,120
company

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,720
their ads have to feed into your into

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,080
your database somehow

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,040
and that's what integration specialists

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,720
do they do lots of um

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,440
not very interesting

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,360
code algorithmically but basically

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,120
gluing different systems together

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,160
and paul's fantastic for that because

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:22,079
the regular expressions and so on

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,079
so um

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,880
context if you look at this chart the

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,959
people at the bottom

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,240
the blue ones they're all these people

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,040
who are filling the survey because

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,880
they're doing perl on their own

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,880
and they feel the need for some help

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,519
now the question that i asked was what

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,959
kind of help do you want

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,800
and from this we can see

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,640
people don't want a face-to-face mostly

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,240
and i can't say that i'm a little bit

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,480
shy particularly when i'm in a

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,040
situation where i don't know stuff and i

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,880
don't even know how to ask the question

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,040
so mostly people want to be able to

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,200
google search

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,320
without even fully articulating what

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,240
their question is

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,880
and hope they find a solution is going

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,560
to get them unstuck

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,519
next thing is looking the discussion

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,800
forums maybe posting a question

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,320
i think that i should have separated

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,120
that into two separate questions

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,959
actually

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,600
reading discussion forums and posting

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,600
questions in them

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,399
i think even though video tutorials are

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,440
great if you really know

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,600
that they're going to answer the

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,959
question that you have

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,920
sometimes it's a big investment in time

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,959
and you find out at the end actually

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,000
they weren't covering what i thought

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,920
they would

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,920
so so again they don't rank too highly

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,519
real-time chat now this is the idea that

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,800
i had when i came into this and i

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,279
realized it was a bad idea

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:55,839
because uh it was uh

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,399
the second least favorite approach to to

00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,399
getting help

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,800
furthermore there's so many different

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,920
kinds of real-time chat

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,200
it would be difficult to have

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,240
any kind of impact because um whichever

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,480
one you choose

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,360
more people aren't using it there's no

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,639
majority

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,920
saying this is our favorite uh real time

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,839
chat

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,240
so i'm not going to spend a lot of time

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,200
on doing real-time chat if

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,560
if people want to do it that's great but

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,519
don't go out of your way thinking that

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:35,120
you can make a big

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,120
impact on nepal uh newbies new newcomers

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,240
now far more interesting than the

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,440
numbers are the kinds of things that

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,440
people are saying in the comments

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,399
if i google my question and the answer

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,839
isn't on stack overflow or pearl monks

00:12:52,399 --> 00:13:00,959
i'm in a pickle that's a very accurate

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,959
statement someone's making um

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,800
so yes you do your google search and

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,079
there are

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,279
not that many different places where you

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,040
can go

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,480
you know you know look in the first

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,279
three links

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,160
it's one of those or you're not going to

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,839
find the answer

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,839
basically so

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,279
we as a community if you want to be

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,000
helpful to

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,000
newcomers then we should try and

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,720
populate

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,680
check overflow poor monks further with

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,040
the kinds of things

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,519
kinds of questions which people are

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,519
asking us

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,600
interestingly i don't think i've got a

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,160
link here but in another document

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,519
which i'll point you to later in stack

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,639
overflow

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,880
if you if you can think of a question or

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,920
type of question which people are asking

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,160
over and over

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,760
in different forms you can actually post

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,199
the question and the answer in stack

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,800
overflow

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:06,320
and you know they do all the um

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,399
google um tuning i mean they

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,800
they basically have a lot of impact in

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,040
terms of google searches so

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,079
if you want to make a difference ask

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,839
yourself a question

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,839
in stack overflow

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,120
pearl ecosystem is big and confusing to

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,120
newcomers

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,959
that's a fact no one can deny it our

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,000
culture

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,800
which people love is tim toady

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,079
for anyone who's a beginner in this in

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,160
this chat

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,000
tim today stands for there is more than

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,440
one way to do it

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,639
that's sort of like a defining principle

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,639
of the pearl community

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,800
that said uh it makes it very difficult

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,480
to write an authoritative textbook or

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,720
lecture or

00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,839
or um course of any kind and so

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,519
when you ask for help and

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,440
ideas about how to how to pursue this

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,519
problem you'll get if you get answers

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:12,240
you'll get lots of different answers

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:14,160
which is a little bit confusing

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,760
the other the other thing is that cpan

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,000
is i think one of

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:23,120
our greatest assets

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,240
but it's difficult to understand

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,639
when you look at the modules in cpan

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,600
even if they look like they serve the

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,000
purpose that you're

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,440
you're in need of it's not clear which

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,759
ones you can trust

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,040
and which ones are suitable for

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,040
beginners and that kind of stuff

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:46,480
so it would be nice

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,920
to be offer one or several

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:53,199
um complete

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:57,600
um sets of

00:15:53,199 --> 00:16:01,040
steps that beginners can take to do oo

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,839
website database etc

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,079
without having to make choices as they

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,079
go

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,000
beginners don't want to make choices i

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,000
think that's fair to say

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,920
we need forums where you aren't made to

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,560
feel like an idiot for asking dumb

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,759
questions

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,360
or don't have to be a guru to be heard

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,720
now this is um a sensitive topic i know

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,959
but um i think

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,880
to be honest this is the kind of thing

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,839
that people find

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,839
um

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,360
he's not inviting about the pearl

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,440
community and

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,360
i don't think we need that look at us

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,160
we're getting old we don't we don't want

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,880
to

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,160
scare away the newcomers so we have to

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,240
think of different ways

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,240
of making it more welcoming

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,000
and another point is that

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,839
early career developers who are younger

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,160
than me

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,319
they want an ide i had to look up in the

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,720
dictionary what ide means

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,120
interactive development environment it

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,360
means not vin

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,360
not ed not even emacs

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:29,440
and they want tutorials so

00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:33,120
some progress has been made we have

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,160
managed to consolidate

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,720
uh three grant proposals

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,919
so if you or you know anybody who'd be

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,520
willing to

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,960
contribute to things like a guideline on

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,160
which idea to use

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:52,000
or improving the ideas that are there

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:55,840
or doing a perl course

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,120
an online perl course then here are

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,360
grant proposals and

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,600
it'd be great if somebody to pick up on

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,600
that

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,720
so that's it um if you would like to

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:15,840
put around get your hands on this stuff

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,440
get involved please send

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,000
whoever i can it to be helpful um

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,440
there's an article on the poll

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,400
foundation's blog

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,640
with a bit more detail and there's the

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,799
war data from the survey

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,039
for you to get a different

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:43,840
interpretation if you want

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:43,840
so that's it are there any questions

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,880
if you have a question just go ahead and

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,880
speak

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,039
carl sorry just with your hand

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,120

well we cannot hear you

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,120
sorry someone has a question i'm not

we can hear him even if he's unmuted

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,320
maybe you can type it

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,840
here's the chat

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,840
oh lots of questions should i be going

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,840
through this

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:55,039
can you hear me now i do thank you

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:58,080
okay yeah excuse me i had my

00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,559
camera unplugged because it had because

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,840
when i plugged it in i couldn't hear you

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:07,840
earlier it's okay you got nothing to

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
hide

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,600
so what did i want to say or ask

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,480
um so i've heard i don't follow it

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,960
myself the

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:23,440
irc pearl channel

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,360
was unwelcome i've heard that it is very

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,240
unwelcoming to newcomers and that

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,200
there's

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,640
disdain for stupid apparent stupid

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,400
questions

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,400
um i don't know if that's true

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:42,320
but yeah

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,320
but my experience

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,520
yeah i actually don't do much pearl

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,039
programming anymore

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,400
because i write in the for the pearl

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,320
core which is written in

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,600
c and so mostly i just write test files

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,120
which don't require too much pro

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,480
knowledge

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:05,520
uh and i know that stack overflow is

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,480
is good for my c questions

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,360
almost entire almost always and i don't

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,200
know how

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:16,640
uh incomplete the pearl answers are

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,200
um i do follow stack overflow pearl

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,120
questions and there are people like

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,039
um ikagami who seem to do a good job of

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,280
answering those

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:32,400
um so i don't know if that's a question

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,840
or is it is a

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,360
um is a comment which um

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,039
yeah i think i think these are the

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,880
things i've heard too

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,440
truth is yeah i do sometimes feel a bit

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:47,520
scared that i'm about to post a question

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,080
uh in irc um and i think i think we need

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,600
to work on this because

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,000
um yeah if people don't feel comfortable

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,640
asking questions then they'll be slower

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,280
at getting started and so we won't as a

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,280
community grow

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,919
i haven't yet got any um any ideas about

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,919
how to approach this

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:15,039
my experience on on p5p pound

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,400
p5p is people are extremely helpful to

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,480
me

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,480
um there are times when i ask a question

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,480
and nobody's around who

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:28,480
knows the answer and but when they are

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:32,880
uh i don't get um

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,880
disdainful responses oh good

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:44,080
andrew thank you yeah sorry

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,840
the one of the questions i had is what

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,200
what you look i guess what we're looking

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,120
for

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,120
is p5u

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,240
like the p5p is for the porters and the

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,919
hard code

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,919
you know what are we gonna do next and

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,720
maintain the language

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,000
we're really looking for is p5u and i

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,840
don't think it's a mailing list i think

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,840
it's a conglomeration of all this stuff

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,720
it's

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,520
it's when you can depend on that

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,720
terminology

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:16,400
p5 p and p u can you just start already

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,280
well by p5p i meant the mailing list

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,600
okay okay so you want the functional

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,640
equivalent of p5u

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,679
users so it goes back on top of that

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,720
empty pay cam

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,840
yeah somebody else talking

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:37,120
okay good you done

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,240
no i got so angry with jackie she was

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,559
arguing with me

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,559
did i i'm not muted

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,279
oh okay um yeah i guess the idea

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,520
is what we're looking for is the

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,960
functional functionality

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,200
but we're not on a mailing list you're

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,080
looking for p5u effectively

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,919
but i don't think it's going to be a

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,640
single entity i think you have to tie

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,880
together

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,120
irc and the facebook pages and

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:09,760
stackoverflow

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,919
and reddit i mean i'm not quite sure

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,559
there's any one place you could

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,559
establish

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,279
but i think we just need people from the

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,760
community

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,200
who are sort of already embedded in

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,279
those places

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,600
yeah it's it's almost like yeah it's

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,200
like a p5p is the twelve disciples the

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,200
rest of us are

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,440
go forth and prophetized

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,360
you know what i'm saying yeah that's a

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,279
rather bad analogy but

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,120
you know so when i'm scrolling at night

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,200
looking at my friends cat memes

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,240
i'll pop on to the facebook pages and

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,279
see if there's anything interesting

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,360
going on start

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:51,440
conversations today

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,799
is i think a hard place to share code

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,880
snippets but yeah

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,720
we start pointing people to jests i mean

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,720
simple questions are easy when it starts

00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,440
getting uh it starts getting complicated

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,320
it's like okay

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,080
fine here put the code in the gist that

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,840
we can talk

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,640
and and the facebooks are more of the

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,360
they're more they're more of the social

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,840
aspect

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,559
they're more of the general question

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,679
aspect it's not so much cody

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:22,159
i think reddit ends up being cody i get

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,799
obviously stack flow ends up being cody

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,000
in specific

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:30,320
but again you know if

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,600
someone's gonna come to pearl and say

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,360
what do i do they'll probably go to

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,799
pearl.com

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,520
or pearl.org and again if there was a

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,200
and there may be i have i did not check

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,200
before i went online before i

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,200
said this but you know resources

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,799
this is where this is this is where that

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,600
is this is where the other is i don't

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,919
know

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,000
how much of the social resources are

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,600
delineated

00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,159
you know there isn't a single

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,799
sort of index of where to go and i think

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,200
that would be

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,440
quite helpful i think it belongs on

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,960
pearl.com isn't that where people would

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,240
logically go

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,799
pearl.com like python.com or pearl.org

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,720
you know whatever cross link them i'm

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,600
putting this in my list of things to do

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,600
is just chase up one

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,480
yeah um do you need links for the

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,799
facebook pages i'll send them to you

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,840
yeah thanks i'll i'll put them uh i

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,279
guess i'll put them in

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,799
uh i'll put them in slack and uh

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:38,480
and ping you thank you you're welcome

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:41,360
let me do that now

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,679
any other ideas yeah sandra i think i

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,640
know

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,960
we've spoken about this uh in the past

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,720
but

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,200
uh i think one of the ways that a new

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,120
programmer comes to pearl potentially

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,559
is when they've got a computing problem

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,480
they're looking to solve

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:58,400
for example parsing a csv file and then

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,799
you're putting that search into google

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,080
and then ideally you want to have

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:06,720
some code to get that problem solved

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,840
and unfortunately i did a test in in an

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,880
earlier talk

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,640
uh at a previous conference and parsing

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,679
csv files for pearl is now

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,279
on page five six of google so we're

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,240
we're falling off the um

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,320
event horizon there and one of the

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,000
problems is is that cpan

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,320
is not presenting the information in a

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,200
in a consumable way for the uh for the

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,840
searcher

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,799
and google is detecting that so part of

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,279
google's

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,440
game is to you know find search

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,240
solutions to search problems

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,960
it's just an association engine uh in

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,880
that respect

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,279
so i think one of the things that we

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,000
could do immediately to try and help the

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,200
situation

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,399
is to make solutions more salient

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,440
in cpan and what i mean there is cut and

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,720
pastable

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,679
digestible chunks of code

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,520
that that basically solve the problem

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,240
that someone might be searching for

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,520
so for example parsing a csv file i'd

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,240
want to actually

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,640
cut and paste from a synopsis exactly

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,720
what

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,559
is required to do that and then

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,720
basically be able to execute that code

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,919
as quickly as possible

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,440
and then that bootstraps someone into uh

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,799
being a pearl programmer before they

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,880
know what they've got a working perl

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:26,399
program that's solving their problem

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:29,600
um don't we have that in most cpan

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,679
um documents like uh we we definitely

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,799
have synopsis this is amazing yeah

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,799
um but we need to have the

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,880
the search problem the actual keywords

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:42,640
that people use in the search

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,880
uh very close to the solution

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,840
and a lot of the modules we've got on

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,720
cpan

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,080
um you know they're multifaceted so date

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,679
time things like this

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,120
there's lots of stuff going on in that

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,440
module uh

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,240
but actually people are looking to solve

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,880
like

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,880
you know select small um

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,080
that's a very good idea um do you think

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,120
that you could

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,480
um publish a

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,120
small um

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,760
um explanation of that and have it

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,600
posted

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,799
on um merced

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,880
because i think they'd be welcoming of

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,840
that

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,080
just saying you know instructions on how

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,799
to

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,600
um how to describe the the functionality

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,080
of

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,080
your module

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:44,240
module does that make sense

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,399
yes it does yeah um

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,880
i'll just just i'll i'll shut up in a

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,600
sec but uh one final thing would be that

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
uh

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,799
actually you could have a new type of

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,360
synopsis for a module

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,039
uh described in cpan so that it's more

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,399
or less a set of

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:03,679
problem solution problem solution

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,760
ways of describing your module and this

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,600
takes the pressure off for the cpan

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,399
authors because often it's hard to

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,039
document

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,720
all the ways a module could be used and

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,840
showing examples is a good way around

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,480
that

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,600
definitely okay i'll shut up thank you
