Title: Our shared vision of Perl - Andrew Solomon
Publication date: 2021-06-10
Playlist: TPC 2021 in the Cloud
Description: 
	What are the challenges of the Perl ecosystem, and how can we make it flourish? Come along to see how the The Perl Foundation is addressing these questions, and what we know so far.

The Perl Foundation is running a survey to identify the shared values of the Perl community, and their vision of the Perl ecosystem in years to come.

The goal is to provide information on which The Perl Foundation, community groups, and individuals can make informed decisions and plans for the future.

In this talk we’ll explain why this research is needed, how we’re collecting the data, and what we have learned so far.

in an hour and that is um

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,920
a shared vision of pearl

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,280
so where do i start so this is a talk

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,599
about

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,959
pearl he started to talk about raku okay

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,080
and you're gonna see why

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,440
as you go through this but basically

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,840
in summary old language challenges

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,840
okay so

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,640
next slide so this is me andrew solomon

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,480
and in the context of this talk uh i am

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,760
the crc commissioned by the poll

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,560
foundation

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,360
in case you're wondering what that means

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,920
i am the community research consultant

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,280
which says uh uh i take full credit for

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,519
that term

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,440
as well i just had to make it up and i

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,319
was writing this talk

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,159
this this came about because i'm

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,239
regarded as the survey person

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,159
now that i've been doing the survey on

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,680
how you should help beginners

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:59,360
and so um so when stuart

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,799
said that we need to do some

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,840
serious research into a

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:10,640
vision of cold by the poor community uh

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:14,000
i was chosen but not just me okay

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,880
uh this group of people have been

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,120
working closely together giving me

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,880
direction on how to

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,320
run this survey and how to interpret the

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,360
results

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,560
and the other point is that this is work

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,080
in progress

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,479
i'm just telling you where things are at

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,759
after a couple of weeks

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,759
but we have a long way to go

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,800
so with that in context

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,600
the objective of this project

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,639
is to identify the shared values of the

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,960
pole community

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,199
and their vision of the pole ecosystem

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:57,680
in years to come

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:59,680
and from there

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,199
we get to the point where the pull

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,160
foundation

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,840
community groups and individuals can

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:12,720
make informed decisions and plans

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,720
so why do we have to do this

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,280
if you ask me what paul was for 20 years

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,280
ago

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,199
can anyone guess what i would have said

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,199
hands up

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,840
someone someone have a guess what i said

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,840
20 years ago

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,160
can anyone

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
volunteer an idea

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:52,479
web stuff yay thank you paul

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:57,520
and if i'd asked the same question

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,520
25 28 years ago any ideas

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,560
sorry database integration yeah that

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,440
kind of stuff

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,919
and and but i mean i would probably be

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,440
impressed that you knew about it then

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:18,560
so it came about for that kind of

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,759
data munching and then

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,479
the web and took off and that was

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,479
i mean we couldn't have got off the

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,880
ground without pearl

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,160
but now there's a whole lot else out

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,120
there for writing

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,400
web applications and he started all

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,080
clear

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,080
what pearl is for

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,319
so i'm going to tell you in this talk

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,919
um first of all i'm going to put it in

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,440
context because

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,599
in truth a year ago i didn't know what

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,840
tpf was i mean i heard a term but i

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,000
didn't actually know what they are

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,479
and now we're going to dig into why

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,960
we're doing this research

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,960
and tell you how you've gone about it

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,039
and then

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:08,080
where is it going so first thing

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,080
what is the tpf

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:18,240
so for the um for the many communities

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,400
that be paul oraku tpf is there to

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,759
manage the finances

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,000
they have a legal team they do community

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,800
affairs

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,039
conflict resolution that kind of thing

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,080
they have a marketing team

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,919
and they have one person nick evans who

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,919
actually does all the work

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,120
um and that's that's the only person

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,000
who's actually got a job with them so

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,160
it's it's

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,160
very much the community uh

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,759
investing their time in trying to get

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,000
paul moving in the right direction

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,240
that said you mustn't confuse it with

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,440
the poll steering council

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,280
and these are the people who uh steer

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,840
technical decisions about

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,879
polls features what goes in the next

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,879
release that kind of stuff

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,240
so with that terminology what do i mean

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,280
when i talk about the poll

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,879
ecosystem and poll communities not

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,280
poor community but poor communities so

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,039
on the one hand there's okay it's people

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,720
read and write poll

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,879
it's also the companies who are

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,080
dependent on pull

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:29,199
and the companies that teach poll

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,039
um and organizations of that type

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,760
and those who sponsor paul who aren't

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,440
necessarily the ones who are using it

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,080
um there are definitely uh companies who

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,440
see value in keeping the pearl ecosystem

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,959
going even though they're not directly

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,240
using it

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:49,519
um and then there's people

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,720
communities who who talk and write about

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,560
poll with that's

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,920
pole groups in various locations or

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,279
people online and then there are

00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,839
obviously the people who develop and

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,160
maintain

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,480
poll it's modules and it's instruction

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,040
websites and so on

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,560
i'm sure i haven't covered half of it

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,440
but i'm just telling you that to give

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,240
you a broad

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,000
sense of um who you're talking about

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,720
when i say

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,720
all communities

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,720
so why are they the tpf in this case

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,720
doing this research

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,160
it's there's a problem right as i said

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,320
there are different ways of making a

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,920
website nowadays so

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,279
uh we have a lot of things that have

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,959
been spawned from pearl

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,279
over the years it's very diverse

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,440
uh lots of different communities lots of

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,720
different applications

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,160
and which i think i can speak

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,880
for all of us we have very little

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,880
awareness of the whole whole ecosystem

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,640
and in particular the pole foundation

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,720
also doesn't have

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,320
huge awareness of all the different

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,440
places where pole

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,000
fits in so

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,760
with this lack of awareness how can the

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,279
pull foundation

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,320
make sensible decisions for marketing

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,079
budget allocation that kind of stuff

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,560
so this is why they need this research

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,560
to be done

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,640
next question how are they doing this

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,360
research

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,640
and this is the fun bit and it's been uh

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,760
it's been

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,600
active for the last couple of weeks and

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:41,440
inactive as of a few days ago

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,720
you're doing a survey and this is a hard

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,760
survey because

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,200
we don't know who the communities are we

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,320
don't know how they're using coal

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,760
we don't even know necessarily job

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,959
titles of the people you're talking to

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,279
so we had to

00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:01,360
ask some very open-ended

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,040
questions in the hope that they would

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,000
start telling us what questions we

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,120
should be asking

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,839
so this is the first step of the

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,680
research and um

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,640
we used gobby which is um

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,320
the brainchild of gary beckwith it's a

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,839
fantastic

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,959
way of putting across a survey where you

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,720
don't really know

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:28,640
what the options are and you ask them

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,440
to the the people fleeing the survey

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,200
to express their ideas around these

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,480
questions then other people can

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,320
vote for these ideas or build on them

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,519
and um it's it's a really great way of

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,800
getting the communities to come up with

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,519
um with concepts which which we didn't

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,760
have

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,760
at the outset so here are the very

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,880
abstract questions that you're asking

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,320
you're saying

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,720
what's your connection with pearl and

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,880
its ecosystem

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,480
what do you see is the pearl ecosystem's

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,480
core values and initiatives

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,079
what are your future aspirations for

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,519
poll

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,279
what do you perceive are the main

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,000
challenges of unifying the poor

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,079
community

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,399
culture and governance with a shared

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,399
vision

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,160
as an individual how might you support

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,880
pearl in the future

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,959
how could poll community groups

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,880
contribute to our long-term goals

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,639
and how can the pearl foundation help

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,920
the community achieve their long-term

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,600
goals

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,040
so these are all very open-ended

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,920
questions

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,560
and as i was telling you how the survey

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,040
works

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,560
um we don't pay too much attention to

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,519
the numbers of people voting for each

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,440
other's

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,560
questions because it could be that a

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,440
really profound

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,160
answer came up um just before we close

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,959
it down

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,279
and then we've got one vote so we aren't

00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:01,839
paying too much change the numbers

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:05,440
and we don't uh take any of the

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,800
answers that people present as being

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,000
precise for example someone said

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,600
and asked what's your connection with

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,240
the pool pull out this ecosystem they

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,639
said

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,920
uh approximately 20 years of usage and

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,880
some cpan modules

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,320
and then they put down their cpan uh

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,000
name

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,760
and 140 104 people voted for that

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,120
response

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,880
indicating that they all had the same

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,200
cpan name i'm not sure

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:37,440
so we aren't taking these um

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,440
these responses as being very accurate

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,279
so what have

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,560
we found out

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,079
so going from

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:57,199
the sort of top level and very

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,000
clear responses start the kind of

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,519
open-ended

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,800
ones one thing which seemed

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,519
to get a great deal of buy-in was that

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,480
we love regular expressions and tim

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,519
toady

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,360
tim turdy for those of you who aren't

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,360
uh very immersed in this particular

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,040
culture tim toady

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,720
stands for that there's more than one

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,800
way to do it okay

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,440
so the things which you find as

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,040
beginners are difficult for about cole

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,519
are things that people really love and

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,680
regular expressions again very complex

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:35,279
and i've noticed senior members

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,079
of the python community

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,199
um having a distaste for regular

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,920
expressions

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,720
but pole developers love regular

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,079
expressions

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,639
okay this is very technical stuff but

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,240
you you can't you can't um untangle the

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,240
technical from

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:58,160
the um the

00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:01,199
abstract um mission of

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,560
the pole communities so

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,040
that's something they love they they

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,360
want communication and collaboration

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,839
between communities

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,199
and they respect diversity and

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,320
inclusivity

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:20,639
inclusivity rather um

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,240
and these were very very much um

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,680
mentioned in different ways so that's

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,320
just my summary of

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,800
of what they were saying then their

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,880
aspirations

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,839
and this is where it gets fun for the

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,040
technical aspirations

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:40,959
the the following three

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,959
aspirations had almost the same

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,240
amount of support one is absolute backup

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,440
compatibility

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,440
another is moderate backward

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,839
compatibility and

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,839
third was scrap backward compatibility

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,120
and have new features

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,560
okay so this is something where as

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,399
as a whole community we're never going

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,120
to agree okay so

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,880
i feel really sorry for the people who

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,519
have to make these decisions

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,279
to sort of step really very carefully

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,880
through this um

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,880
but it's it's to be expected

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:20,399
um another thing is that

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,399
people aspired having more

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:27,279
more uh features and

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,839
modules and um

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,199
things which plug into other systems i

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,000
think that that's something that we're

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,279
falling behind

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,279
on that

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,720
large service providers with

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:45,440
a um and not a an api don't necessarily

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,639
help put together a poll sdk for that

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,839
whereas they do

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,839
for things like node.js and python

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,360
uh the other the other thing which

00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,320
people aspire to

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:03,680
is a change to management

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,120
they want um

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,839
us to improve our public image to have

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,480
clearer branding a more vibrant

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,240
community

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,679
and a focus on pearl's technical

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,720
strengths

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,439
and better behavior within our community

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,079
and

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,240
also just clear logos and images if you

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,280
don't have that

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,079
i think um if you ask

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,200
anyone any group of people what the poll

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,080
logo is you'll get different answers

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,200
so so these are the aspirations and um

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,160
some of them are easier

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,160
to fix than others

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,720
as for challenges people are feeling

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,559
isolated because the community is small

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,960
and appears to be shrinking

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,320
i don't know yet that that's true but

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,440
certainly

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,480
it's um it's not the hugest community in

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,720
in the tech sector there's a lot of

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,640
conflict and noise

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:06,320
and um i think that this is perhaps

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:09,760
out of proportion um

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:14,400
and there's no shared mission statement

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,880
for the poll community as a whole

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,320
there's no benevolent dictator and i

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,160
guess that's part of where the conflict

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,880
comes from that

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,880
that it's not clear who makes decisions

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:32,720
and some newcomers feel unwelcomed

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,880
also the tim toady there's more than one

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,919
way to do it uh is sometimes

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,559
verging on uh the sort of

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,320
aggression within the community and this

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,360
is the best way

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,720
your way doesn't make sense and so

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,640
there are these cultural problems that

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,640
we need to improve

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,080
again features versus back in

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,600
compatibility

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,440
with something else i guess which comes

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,280
up with um

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,640
in terms of uh how perl as a language

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,400
moves forward and

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,440
um all these things

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,280
lead to some challenge for the tpf and

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,640
the pell student council to have

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,640
authority and make decisions

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,799
so

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,600
ideas with all these challenges there is

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,320
still ideas being put forward

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,160
one is the the way that these issues are

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,520
being made that we should be governed

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,360
one of the ideas that should be governed

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,960
in a democratic

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,960
way or through paid membership

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,120
we need to raise our profile and

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:53,840
communicate

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:55,600
better the way decisions are being made

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,200
we need to do more marketing for the

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,480
wonderful things that we have

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,400
we've got lots of great modules like

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,840
dbc mojo dancer plaque etc but we're not

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,080
marketing them necessarily as well as we

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,080
could

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:16,720
um we could do with more training

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,720
scholarships learning materials

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,320
um building trust around community

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:26,000
ideals these are very abstract ideas but

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,559
um i think that again

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,039
that follows on from having shared

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,039
visions

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,159
also building our brands not just the

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,120
pearl brand but also the brands of these

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,760
sub-communities

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,080
whether it be modules or groups of

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,080
people

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,960
and um

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,280
now just things like increasing the

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,120
funding increasing the transparency of

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,480
the pearl foundation

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,600
um having more liaison between the pearl

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,080
foundation

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,720
community and industry i think that

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,360
that's

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,640
um that's actually very important and

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,400
that will

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,600
help get support for for example

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:13,520
sdks for various apis of

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,520
big services like amazon

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,200
um

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,280
and also the way that the the pearl

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,559
foundation funds things

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:29,120
i think with this communication these

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:32,559
these decisions will be made uh

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,559
in a more productive way

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,400
so with all this information it's far

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,520
from getting a shared vision but it

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,840
certainly brought up

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,000
i think really important questions to

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,280
address

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,240
so what are we going to do now i think

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,200
the next steps and it's not just me it's

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,640
a whole it needs

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,760
more people involved and if you have

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,440
thoughts on this i want you to be

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,559
involved as well so please get in touch

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,799
but

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,200
the next steps are to crystallize these

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,320
ideas

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:10,000
propose a shared vision

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,159
identify alternative paths to get there

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,799
and all this is going to involve more

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,039
surveys and the like

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,039
um

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,640
we will then have to

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,440
rethink tps activities and see how they

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,120
can be

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,120
more focused around these desired

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:33,679
outcomes

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:37,600
now that we know them and

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:41,120
obviously communicate this stuff so that

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,039
communities can then rethink

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,880
you know how they fit in what are their

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,679
goals

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,000
and um does it match what the the

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,760
broader community

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,600
need and um finally

00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:01,280
and more tangibly tpf can

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,640
then use this information to direct its

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,200
funding

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,480
to push things in in the right direction

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,440
now that they all know

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,840
what that is but as i said this this is

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,360
um

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:16,159
halfway through the research um you know

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,600
maybe only 10 of the way through but it

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,840
has to be done

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,840
so that's where we're at are there any

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
questions

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:41,679
i well it's not so much a

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,679
question as a remark um

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,559
it's it's not really anything new i mean

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,480
the the the things that are

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,760
pointing out people have been pointing

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,440
that out for for

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,880
10 15 maybe even even 20 years

00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,799
we haven't done well basically we

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,400
haven't made any progress in the last 20

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,679
years so

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,400
why would we you going to make any

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:11,120
progress in the next 10 years

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,120
well um i think that this is um

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,080
this seems to be the first time has been

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,799
addressed so directly correct me if i'm

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,240
wrong

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,640
but i think it's the first i think okay

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,640
correct we we've tried to address this

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,279
many times we have tried to address this

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,760
in

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,840
in in in both in in in all the

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,200
conferences

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:38,559
um we have talked about it

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,840
many many times but we are not changing

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,120
so

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:47,840
why would we expect to change now

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,840
should we just give up

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,960
maybe it's not that much of a problem

00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,000
are our other languages doing better in

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,320
this expense

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,559
well our direct competitor is doing

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,400
extremely well

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:10,880
um and i don't see

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,480
any technical reason why that should be

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,039
the case

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,799
so clearly there's something to do with

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,919
the way that we um are projecting

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,559
ourselves

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,960
to our souls even which is getting in

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,960
the way

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,000
our direct competitor doesn't use dollar

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,520
signs and lots of people are afraid

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,799
of dollar signs fair enough

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,679
that could be it could be the dollar

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,679
sign that you're tripping on

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,799
i know um i think i think

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,640
we could just say yeah we're always

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,320
going to be um

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:54,840
a small uh side

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:58,640
alley for software development but

00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,400
um i find that's kind of sad because i

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,360
really think that we can

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,320
write really nice code using paul in a

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,440
way that we can't

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,840
with most of the competitors so you know

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,880
i think

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,600
i think we're doing the broader

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,840
um developer community a disservice by

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,880
not selling to them and showing that

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,880
they can get a lot from it

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,520
i think people have been trying to do

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,360
that for

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:31,200
almost as long pearl has existed

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,279
um apparently the world is not buying

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,760
that

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,120
the world is one the world is not buying

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,080
that like you can write

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,080
good coding pro

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,520
regardless whether that's true or not

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,960
don't think of this thought i i i won't

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,960
say it's it's

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,640
uh it's not possible you could be your

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,840
right and

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,720
you won't get anywhere with this but

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,720
it's worth a try

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,880
any other thoughts or advice

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,880
help you can offer

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:20,880
well sure can i can i say something

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,600
please go ahead

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,039
yeah uh i have one advice because

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,320
everyone is trying to

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,679
find these problems and the solutions

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,720
and

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,760
uh yeah i don't know it's like

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,880
double negative spirit spiraling

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,559
kind of thing we're doing uh of course

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,399
it would be nice to see like

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,679
exact answers and graphs and

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,000
visualizations

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,760
because i think a lot of people are of

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,880
course curious and and

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:54,080
they want to see like their their

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,559
pet reason for why pearl is not

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,000
up there and find it in the

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,399
visualizations and say

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,440
see i was right all the time bigger logo

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,760
or

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,559
i mean there's so many things you can do

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,200
but i think

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,600
people should concentrate rather on

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,399
having fun with pearl

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,960
just do stuff that you like and have fun

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,600
if you

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,080
are positive and like things and spread

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,880
that

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,399
that's it's not harder than that instead

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,520
because now we're kind of

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,320
now we're kind of liking to be sad but

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,360
that's

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,039
there's no reason just be happy do cool

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,520
things and we've seen lots of people

00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,360
present things that you are possible

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,640
that were never possible before

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:40,080
and explore and yeah just have fun

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,960
that's my proposition

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,600
thank you and i think i think that

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,640
there's

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:50,080
huge value in us focusing on that

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,120
because the more we sort of think only

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:58,320
about the

00:28:51,120 --> 00:29:00,320
things that are going wrong

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,880
this is an announcement that lightning

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,240
talks will be starting in three minutes

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,760
thank you so we have uh

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,960
two minutes and 50 seconds

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,159
let me take 20 seconds to say i'm on the

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,919
positive side

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,279
of most of the discussions here and

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,760
i think that the work that you all have

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:25,360
done is

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,000
an important part of a possible solution

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,279
so i thank

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,960
you very much for it thank you so much

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,760
that's really helpful if you need that

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,760
kind of encouragement

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:43,679
i think i'll throw in 10 seconds

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,799
uh i think uh since we're part of an

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,559
open source community

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,799
but the fact that we actually attend

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:52,240
this conference for example

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,919
i think we should have a little bit of a

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,720
consideration of what that means being

00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:00,000
an open source developer a contributor

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,919
and one like feature that

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,440
i think we haven't talked much about

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,320
that we probably

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,039
should bring to the fourth front of my

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,840
mind

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,600
is that everybody that is part of an

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,880
open source community

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,919
in some ways has to show some leadership

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,520
in the fact that they do things they

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,320
influence the community

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,960
and the businesses that depend upon us

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,880
um

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,120
by the fact that they either do

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,480
something or choose not to do so so

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,279
so and something so so

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,320
maybe we need leadership in some ways

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,360
but

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,600
at the same time we do

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,720
have to also show leadership by by the

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,279
actions

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,919
we do and uh inaction is a form of

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,120
leadership

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,960
uh so keep that in mind that's what i

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,360
wanted to say

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,360
thank you

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,159
okay so we have to close this session

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,880
lightning talk

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,760
are about to start please join us in the

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,840
lightning talk

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,799
session and of course the discussion can

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:15,360
continue online thanks on the rule for

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,360
