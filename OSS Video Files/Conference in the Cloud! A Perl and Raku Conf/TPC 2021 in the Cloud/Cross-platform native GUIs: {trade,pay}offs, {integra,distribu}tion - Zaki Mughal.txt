Description: 
	Choosing to create a cross-platform GUI presents different challenges from other kinds of applications. I'll talk about why I chose that path, what I learned/built along the way, and the (Perl) tools I had to write to make it manageable.
I want you to write native GUI applications (in Perl) and I'll show you how you can

- Fight for the `$USER`.
- Act on `localhost`.
- Own your data.

With native applications you can use all the capabilities of your snazzy computer — this is computing without artificial limits.

- Learn why I think you should consider writing a native GUI app in 2021. No, I don't mean make a web application and wrap it in a standalone browser — though what you learn from my talk will make that easier too.
- Are we deploying once on homogeneous infrastructure? You wish. Learn from all the nerve-racking build failures I slogged through.
- We're going retro and bringing back the 90s. The good parts hopefully.
- A wild PDL appears! But how? You'll have to attend to find out.
