Title: A tour of Perl's new documentation style guide - Jason McIntosh
Publication date: 2021-06-09
Playlist: TPC 2021 in the Cloud
Description: 
	The next release of Perl will include a new style guide for its core documentation. In this talk, the guide's principal author discusses the motivations for this new "perldocstyle" man page, walks through its content, and outlines its role in Perl's future.

The next release of Perl will include a new man page named "perldocstyle": a style guide for the language's core documentation. Inspired by a call to action made by Sawyer X at 2019's TPC, the guide promotes documentation that centers approachability for new Perl programmers, while retaining the work's unique voice and its value as a history-steeped reference.

In this talk, the style guide's principal author, Jason McIntosh, discusses the history of the guide's creation, including the motivation that sparked it and the many contemporary projects and practices that helped inform it. Jason will walk the audience through the guide, exploring its content section-by-section: its fundamental concepts, its advice on formatting and structure, and its recommendations for tone, content, and overall organization.

Jason will also describe the guide's role as a founding document for Perl's new documentation team, and how it helps lay the groundwork for that team's initial projects and goals at the start of the Perl 7 era.

okay welcome everybody

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,200
i would like to tour you through pearl

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,080
doc style a new

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,240
documentation guide style guide that

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,000
started shipping with pearl this year

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,440
before that i'd like to talk a bit about

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,680
the origins of this project

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,000
and i'll start with a short personal

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,400
introduction

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,840
i'm jason mcintosh i started learning

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,560
pearl in the 1990s

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,000
and i'm still learning it i've worked as

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,280
a professional software engineer

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,360
this whole time but in 2019 a collision

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,200
of events encouraged me to refocus my

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,280
career on writing

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,760
one of these events has particular

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,520
relevance to this project

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,160
in his keynote address to that year's

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,000
pearl conference sawyer x gave an honest

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,640
look to the ways that pearl falls short

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,800
as an approachable language to newcomers

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
among other things he focused on its

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,000
documentation

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,920
noting its vast amount and how some of

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,199
it was either outdated or difficult to

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,640
comprehend

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,879
he suggested a future where the

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,600
documentation instead puts beginners

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,840
first

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,799
values consistency and readability

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,640
overall

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,720
and better lends itself for use as a

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,240
teaching tool

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,760
at the encouragement of my friend adam

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,360
herzog i took this

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,960
as a call to become a contributor to

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,960
pearl's documentation

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,880
months later under a grant from the pro

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,479
foundation and under the guidance of

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,799
sawyer and many others

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,680
i revised the novella length

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,560
documentation

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,880
of pearl's open built-in and completed

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,360
the

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,759
pearl open toot man page that tom

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,680
christensen had begun years ago

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,560
all this work shipped with pearl version

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,799
532 last year

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,439
the heralding of pearl 7 at last year's

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,119
tpc led to a follow-up project that had

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,920
emerged from my earlier conversations

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,920
with sawyer

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,040
it would be a research project that

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,360
would establish

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,680
new documentation standards for pearl

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,320
gathering up both community expertise

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,439
and best practices from pearl's fellow

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,079
open source

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,079
language projects after receiving

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,719
another generous grant from tpf

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,240
i started this work in the fall of 2020.

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,920
i didn't quite know where the work would

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,759
lead so i just called it the metadocs

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,680
project at first

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,599
i began by gathering up documentation

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,360
about documentation within pearl's core

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,120
collection that included pearl pod by

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
larry wall and sean emberk

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,239
a reference to the pod markup language

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,360
that pearl docs use

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,200
and pearl pod style by russ albury

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,000
providing documentation formatting

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,160
guidelines to authors of cfan modules

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,680
and that was about it but it gave me

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,239
clues to look elsewhere

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,640
pearl pod style refers to established

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,519
unix man page practices and researching

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,720
these

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,440
led me to the man pages man page

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,239
of the linux kernel project from there i

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,920
saw how kernel.org treats documentation

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,599
as its own discrete project

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,920
and how much care and attention they

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,000
give it i was really impressed

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,040
and i wanted to see more so i asked

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,280
colleagues

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,360
to name some open source languages with

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,879
good documentation

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,319
thus i ended up studying python rust

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,480
and yes raku and very quickly i saw that

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,959
all four of these projects linux kernel

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,800
included had two things in common

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,519
they treated their documentation as a

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,360
discrete sub project with its own team

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,680
and they all had a style guide of some

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,040
kind whether that's a formal man page or

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,640
just a few wiki pages

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,480
on github pearl had neither of these

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,280
the specific goals of the metadocs

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,879
project suddenly seemed quite clear

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,560
one more thing about my background i

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,879
have a degree in journalism

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,680
and this imbued me with talismanic

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,560
reverence for

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,239
the ap style book a set of guidelines

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,760
that helps all the contributors of a

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,360
given publication to write

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,360
more or less in the same voice or at

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,239
least harmoniously

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,280
i love pearl and i wanted very much to

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,879
gift pearl with something like this

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,599
so pearl dog style it ships with pearl

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,560
as of version 534 that is just last

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,360
month

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,280
here it is on pearldoc.pl some credits

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,920
first i was this document's primary

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
author

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,720
and i used some of the pearl

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,840
foundation's grant funds to hire

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,000
samantha hamilton

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,599
a freelance technical writer to act as

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,840
an impartial editor

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,519
via github pull request number 18275

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,040
the document's initial draft received

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,759
tech review by dan book

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,800
david cantrell nicholas clark felipe

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,440
gasper

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,199
graham knop ken williamson and sawyer x

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,479
and was release engineered by james

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,280
keenan

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,800
the content steals liberally from all

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,080
the open source projects i mentioned

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,040
earlier and it borrows

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,600
some key concepts from daniela preceta's

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,320
diataxis documentation framework as well

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,120
which i'll talk more about later the

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,880
guide takes

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,120
a descriptive approach not a

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,199
prescriptive one that is it documents

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,040
how the best pearl documentation

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,720
has been written rather than attempting

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,880
to dictate some other way of doing

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,400
things i did my best to make the guide

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,880
readable and interesting

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,400
really i want you all to read it it's

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,919
just the first draft of what i hope will

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,199
be a living document that has a lot of

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,800
growth and change ahead of it

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,560
and notably it's not super long in fact

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
let's start stepping through it the

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,400
guide itself keeps to

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,840
classic pearl pod style leading with

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,880
name and description sections

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,440
its very first paragraphs set at scope

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,479
pearl's core documentation which it

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,600
defines as

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,000
all the docs that ship with pearl that

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,320
means

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,199
all its hundred or so man pages as well

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,280
as

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,199
the documentation of all the modules

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,160
that pearl pulls down from cpan when you

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,600
install it as listed in pearl mod lib

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,280
and it gives a special shout out to

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,840
pearl funk a self-contained

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,080
reference work unto itself with hundreds

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,039
of individual sections

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,360
the guide states it's above all goal as

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,240
consistency with an eye to newcomers

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,479
there's that pearl 7 sneaking in again

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,720
encouraging consistency of pearls

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,240
docs will help its readers especially

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,560
those new to pearl to feel

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,919
more welcome and engaged with pearl's

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,520
documentation

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,960
and this in turn will help the pearl

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,680
project itself

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,600
grow stronger through having a larger

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,280
more diverse and more confident

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,800
population of knowledgeable

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,639
users onto fundamentals

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,240
definitions of what the docs are

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,680
actually made of

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,000
pod here's that descriptive tone

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,360
pearl documentation is written in pod if

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,400
i were green fielding this

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,240
it would be markdown but pearl uses pod

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,160
and if python docs can still use

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,080
restructured text in 2021

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,479
pearl can use pod um american english

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,680
sounds a bit nationalistic it's mostly

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,759
just about spelling

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,280
um in american english color has no u

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,720
math has no s

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,400
collective nouns like team take

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,160
non-plural verbs and so on

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,680
it's an arbitrary choice but the

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,360
majority of docs

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,440
already favor american english in the

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,000
sense and so we adopt that as

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,280
its official standard as the guide says

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,960
it's like agreeing on the number of

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,960
spaces in your code indentation

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,479
it doesn't affect the compiler but it

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,319
does prevent the human reader

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,919
from encountering jarring stylistic

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,960
shifts mid-document

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,479
it just makes for a smoother read um the

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,680
documentations and coding should be

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,759
utf-8 everywhere

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,319
and the underlying style guide which

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,319
this guy declared itself to inherit from

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:22,160
is the chicago manual of style aka cmos

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:25,520
i had seen i gotta move my

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,520
window thing here there we go

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,440
i had seen most every other technical

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,160
style guide i encountered

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,240
name themselves as extensions to cmos so

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,360
i took a page from them

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,599
more to the point i

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,560
more to the point i took about 1200

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,080
pages from them

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,280
um this is one of the first things i'd

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,560
like to change speaking of living

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,840
documents

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,000
i've learned more about how

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,479
organizations use cmos since last winter

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,319
and know

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,000
despite what pearl doc style says right

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,400
now nobody should literally

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,199
read through it cmos is a trusted

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,800
foundation

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,639
and good to have as an editorial

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,160
reference but project contributors

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,560
don't really need a working knowledge of

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,280
it i've learned that many documentation

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,039
teams

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,280
based their own work on the microsoft

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,599
style guide a chicago extension

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,039
that adds lots of guidelines specific to

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,800
writing about software

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,639
and others use the google style guide

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,919
which builds on microsoft's which builds

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,000
on chicago

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,160
i think perl doc style will want to take

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,080
these into consideration

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,000
the final paragraphs of the fundamental

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,520
section touch on contributing to pearl

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,199
stocks which for now is

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,800
just a pointer to the same pearl hack

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,919
man page that tells you how to

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,039
contribute to pearl's

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,039
code base in general the guide's next

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,360
major section deals with the formatting

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,360
and structure of pearl documentation

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,640
a lot of what's here explicitly builds

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,320
on pearl pod style

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,560
it's really well established stuff

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,320
regarding how to title documents

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,600
what sections readers expect to see and

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,000
so on again

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,680
layers of tradition apply descriptively

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,680
but pearl pod style is about

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,800
user contributed docs and this is about

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,640
core docs

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,320
most of which are distributed with pearl

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,360
itself so the concerns are subtly

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,880
different

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,600
for example the question of license and

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,360
copyright sections is an interesting one

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
there was and remains a lot of

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,480
inconsistency about how the docs treat

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,240
this information

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,760
what's in pearl doc style now is the

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,160
result of a lot of conversation i had

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,600
with p

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,760
high fee in 2020 and i expected to have

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,760
a lot more refinement ahead of it the

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,519
consensus i found was that

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,440
you don't need license and copyright at

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,560
least not for documentation that's

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,560
maintained as part of

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,640
perl source repository because anything

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,640
in there inherits from perl's own

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,040
license and copyright info

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,120
but the docs certainly can and should

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,920
have author and contributor sections

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,120
offering

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,880
appropriate attribution

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,880
after that comes a section on formatting

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,800
rules this again gets into some

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,320
arbitrary seeming stuff informed by my

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,640
own observations of

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,800
pearls source management tools what the

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,560
current docs do conversations with the

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,760
community and occasionally

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,839
looking at other languages best

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,720
practices just like the choice of

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,120
american english

00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,920
our aim here is consistency and it's not

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,079
necessarily

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,519
very engaging material on its own it's a

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,360
lot of sections about

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,880
the length of the lines and pod source

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,839
uh how deep to invent

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,519
excuse me indent example code blocks

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,519
it's four by the way because that's what

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,200
the pearl style man page says

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,040
uh when to include parentheses after

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
mentioning function names and how to

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,120
represent placeholder arguments and so

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,040
on honestly a lot of this just adapts

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,120
the notes i made as i revised the open

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,760
function document last spring

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,279
i don't consider it exhaustive but i do

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,279
feel it's a good start towards

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,480
documenting the best ways to format

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,760
pearl's own documentation i'd like to

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,839
highlight a couple of my favorite

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,600
guidelines because they represent wholly

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,160
new ideas to me

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,440
first did you know that pod supports

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,839
comments

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,519
you can create both one line comments

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,480
and whole comment blocks

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,320
using its for and begin end syntax

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,880
addressing them to a fictional formatter

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,240
named

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,040
comment any pod renderer will discard

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,279
this text

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,519
and it stays visible to people directly

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,519
reading the doc's source

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,880
this takes advantage of the docs as code

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,000
philosophy that pearl's

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,079
already pursued since time immemorial

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,240
the pod really is source code that

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,640
compiles into different published

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,079
human readable formats and i loved to

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,040
learn about a new way

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,040
to take advantage of this related to

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,360
that is tables and diagrams

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,040
perl documentation tends not to have

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,399
much of either because pod doesn't

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,720
really support them

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,600
but you can fake it with those begin end

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,320
blocks

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,560
that pod processors and html processors

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,640
in particular can choose to work with

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,560
the new style guide points this out i'm

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,800
not sure if this will go anywhere

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,600
but i did want to start to open the door

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,680
for

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,760
pearl documentation to have more

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,600
illustration and to do so in a careful

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,519
and accessible way finally the guide

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,880
covers the special formatting rules that

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,040
pearl funk uses which

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,079
are a universe unto themselves and which

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,680
we really

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,360
don't need to get into here but i

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,880
honestly had a great time puzzling them

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,760
out to the degree that i did and they

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,320
were a lot of fun to document

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,920
onto tone and style my guiding light

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
through this section was the diataxa

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,839
system

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,800
devised by daniela preceta which

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,240
identifies

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,639
four main kinds of technical

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,480
documentation what pearl doc style calls

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,040
documentation modes

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,959
in this section i map these onto how

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,040
pearl has historically divided up its

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,079
own docs and came up with tutorials

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,600
cookbooks reference and explainers

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,920
so the guide presents a little

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,639
subsection about each

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,440
tutorials have a focus on learning by

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,680
doing

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,839
of the four modes they need to show the

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,920
most difference to newcomers

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,680
some tutorials will likely be the first

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,600
documentation read by a new pro

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,680
programmer and maybe even a new

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,680
programmer entirely

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,360
after completing a tutorial the reader

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,120
should feel like they've been led from

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,959
zero knowledge of its topic to having an

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,760
invigorating spark of basic

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,320
understanding

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,279
excited to learn more and experiment

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,600
further

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,440
pearl intro is the most prominent

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,839
example the core docs have

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,040
plenty more specific tutorials such as

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,040
pearl excess toot

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:14,240
pearl pack 2 and pearl re2

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,560
cookbooks focus on results the reader

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,639
has specific problem solved or a task to

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,120
complete so let's get them sorted

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,880
a cookbook doesn't spend a lot of energy

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,279
explaining how any of this works

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,399
that's for other manual pages to cover

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,079
and this is where pods

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,720
excellent support for cross references

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,160
comes in handy use those l tags

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,320
in the larger world this is where

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,200
resources like stack overflow fall

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,959
in pearlsdocs we find cookbooks in

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,680
sections four and above of the pearl

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,680
fact

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,959
and in man pages like pearl unicook

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,480
reference sections are all about

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,560
description austere uniform and succinct

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,320
reference pages often arranged into a

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,519
whole section of mutually similar

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,160
subpages

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,000
lend themselves well to random access by

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,279
a reader who knows precisely what

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,360
knowledge they need

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,519
requiring only the minimum amount of

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,880
information before returning to the task

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,800
at hand

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,240
pearlfunk is the star of this show in

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,399
pearl's core docs of course

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,480
it also tends to be the default mode of

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,720
any cpan module's documentation

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,480
if you have only a little bit of space a

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,320
single pod section dangling off the end

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,040
of your dm library

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,360
it should probably be a reference and

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,240
the fourth and final mode is explainers

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,839
deep and expert dives into some topic

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,839
pearl funk to one side

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,519
most of pearl's built-in documentation

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,279
falls into this category

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,920
a great example is pearl sin s-y-n

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,880
which both defines and philosophically

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,920
defends

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,639
pearls famously idiosyncratic syntax and

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,160
uses

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,079
all the words it needs in the process

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,920
the rest of the perl doc style chapter

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,000
comprises several micro essays

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,360
each based on me spending a year

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,480
studying documentation

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,320
seeing how it compares to other

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,800
languages docs and learning about the

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,079
craft of technical writing in general

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,440
i'd really like you to read these and

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,880
let me know what you think in this

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,920
presentation i'll pull out just a couple

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,279
of points i've already heard the most

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,800
feedback about

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,560
assume readers intelligence but not

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,399
their knowledge by this i mean that

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,440
documentation should treat the reader

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,880
as smart curious and ready to learn

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,480
but they should not assume that the

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,399
reader has been a system administrator

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,639
since the usenet dates

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,320
avoid unexplained discussion of

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,000
technologies other than perl that

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,720
includes c in unix

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,120
and make sure to use jargon with care

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,800
using summaries or cross-references

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,959
as often as necessary so as not to

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,120
alienate new readers

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,639
also don't assume that your readers know

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,079
who darth vader is

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,240
while pearl's documentation

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,320
distinguishes itself with a distinct

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,680
style and voice it reaches the most

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,959
people when it aims for

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,399
cultural neutrality one other

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,800
lead with common cases and best

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,920
practices this is also inspired by the

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
reformatting of

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,560
the open built in under sawyer's guides

00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
yes there's more than one way to do it

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,519
but sometimes over the span of decades

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,839
some ways seem to start to seem a little

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,800
better than others let's describe those

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,800
ways first

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,000
and in the most detail if you're writing

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,199
an exhaustive reference

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,320
and there are alternate ways to

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,040
accomplish something the reader should

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,199
know about

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,120
perhaps they're working with legacy code

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,720
cover them afterwards and feel no qualms

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,199
about marking them as deprecated or at

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,920
least

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,759
unusual the open functions documentation

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,199
now spends almost all of its energy on

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,279
the three argument style

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,880
and relegates all of the classical forms

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,639
with bear words and such

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,639
to a trailing section called legacy

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,240
usage it's all still there

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,800
it's just not given equal measure

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,880
anymore quite deliberately

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,720
the document concludes with an index of

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,399
preferred terms honestly i find this the

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,399
most fun part of any style guide

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,920
and it's really just a miniature domain

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,600
specific glossary advising

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,079
consistent spelling and usage of terms

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,759
that might otherwise invite ambiguity

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,199
this index is very short it's really

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,079
just the terms i happen to know during

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,560
my research

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,639
it's likely to grow quite a bit uh a

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,560
couple of examples unix

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,959
pearl's core docs spell it in so many

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,959
creative ways but a slim majority

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,079
as well as the internet at large seems

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,079
to favor capital u

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,199
lowercase everything else and no

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,600
asterisks so

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,039
that's how pearlbox style has it closer

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,319
to home and arguably a little more

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,720
interesting the guide

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,439
details when to capitalize pearl and

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,880
when to follow it with a number

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,559
and that's the new style guide in a

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,079
nutshell what happens next with it well

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,199
again i'd love for you to read it and

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,600
tell me what you think

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,280
you can contact me by email or drop by

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,799
the docs channel of irc.parole.org

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,520
and you know as with the rest of pearl

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,520
full requests always welcome

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,640
uh the first docs team project based on

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,799
the style guide's vision

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,720
is a documentation audit and gap

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,200
analysis now underway by hawar

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,960
latif khan a communication specialist

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,280
that the pearl foundation has hired

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,120
through a grant from google's season of

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,039
docs program

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,480
and yes by the way there is a docs team

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,440
officially recognized by the pearl

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,440
steering council

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,720
though it's really just me right now and

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,400
so far its role

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,400
and initial activity has been the

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,840
auditing project

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,520
in his address to the write the docs

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,840
conference in april 2021 daniela prasita

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,919
shared an emblem that he found stamped

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,600
on his grandparents treasured bookcase

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,760
after he had inherited it

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,880
it says always complete but never

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,200
finished

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,039
this struck him as an apt epigram to the

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,480
art of technical writing

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,120
of course it strikes me as a

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,360
fundamentally pearlish expression too

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,720
pearl's documentation has always boasted

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,520
accuracy and completeness

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,000
and we will never call it finished let's

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,080
adopt

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,760
the same motto as we work to make

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,320
pearl's core docs

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,559
the best that they can be thank you very

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,559
much

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,559
we just have a few minutes for questions

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,160
if anybody has anything

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,320
i had a quick question todd this is

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,080
brett um

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,240
thank you for the presentation uh i'm

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,360
interested in documentation just in

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,880
general

00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,559
but um my question for you is in in your

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,720
research have you run into uh

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,559
i guess you're doing audits you're

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,799
probably looking at um

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,600
you know the topics and information

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,360
that's covered

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,120
have you run into any gaps or do you

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,480
anticipate looking for any gaps

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,679
regarding

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,200
either the capability of pod itself or

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,200
tools that are currently available

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,120
that's a really good question um that

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,480
what i'm focusing right now on right now

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,440
what we're focusing right now in the

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,039
auditing project

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,440
is content um what's the what people

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,760
looking

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,799
to learn how to use pearl c which is not

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,000
the pod

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,280
um your question is legitimate and

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,559
separate from that and i'm very

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,000
interested in that as well

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,000
uh because yeah pod does have

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,559
shortcomings a couple of which i touched

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,120
on it

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,000
it's very old it predates markdown and

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,360
other

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,240
um things in that uh philosophy by many

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,000
years so

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,919
it doesn't have uh inline image support

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,120
or a way to make tables and other things

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,960
that are actually quite useful when

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,080
writing technical documentation

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,360
um so yeah these are legit questions and

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,720
they're ones i look forward to digging

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,559
into and if you have any thoughts in the

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,600
meantime

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,640
i would love to hear them um please talk

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,640
i think that'd be great

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,640
okay thank you thank you

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,559
any other questions uh like i said feel

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,600
free to drop by

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,080
the um the docs channel on irc right now

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,919
um

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,360
i don't know if that'll be the uh the

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,240
permanent home of documentation

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,679
discussion

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,240
uh the other notable channel is um pound

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,559
doc's

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,159
hyphen audit on the tpf slack if you

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,520
haven't already be in the dpf flag and

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,520
that's where we're discussing

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,799
the docs audit uh ongoing right now and

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,760
if you're interested in helping out with

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,960
that

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,480
um effort drop me out um per

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,320
my my lightning talk with makoto

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,120
yesterday uh we could use another

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,120
volunteer or two

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,280
all right well i don't see any other or

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,919
hear any other questions so i'm going to

00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,840
bow out

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,200
um thank you all for coming enjoy the

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:07,200
rest of
