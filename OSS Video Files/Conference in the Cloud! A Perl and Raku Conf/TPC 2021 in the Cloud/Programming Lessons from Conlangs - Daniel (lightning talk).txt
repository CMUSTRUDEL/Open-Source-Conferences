all right so uh

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,000
whether you're talking about pearl or

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,280
raku we both share

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
many things but we share um a linguistic

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,719
heritage

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,519
um courtesy of larry wall and you know

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,039
writing

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,760
uh pearl and raku really feels

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,080
both like i am using a natural language

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,160
and

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,119
like i am uh constructing my own

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,400
language as

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,519
as i go um and i want that language to

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,000
have all sorts of wonderful

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,120
characteristics and of course i

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,079
read a lot about good practices

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,680
in writing programming languages but it

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,320
occurred to me the other day

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,079
that there are a group of people who

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,600
also think a lot about what it means

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,000
to write uh and construct a language

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,039
those are not just programmers but also

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,840
the conlangers

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,039
people who work on constructing their

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,520
their own languages

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,719
either uh for fun there are a tremendous

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,840
number of people who do that

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,680
as as a hobby um or to

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,280
change the world they're they're people

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,840
who are inventing languages to

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,600
facilitate international communication

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,000
or or professionally um you may not have

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,680
heard

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,040
of david peterson but um

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,479
if you have seen uh an episode of game

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,600
of thrones or

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,320
uh expanse or a number of other

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,600
uh science fiction and fantasy series

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,799
you have heard his work

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,280
he is a conlanger who um

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,079
has created two languages for game of

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,159
thrones

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,759
and um a number of other languages

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,799
outside of that and he has a uh

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,079
youtube channel where he talks about all

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,159
of the different sort of design

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,000
decisions that go into

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,360
creating um a new and interesting and

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,680
different

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,640
artificial language and i think a lot of

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
those

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,719
um apply to programming i'm not going to

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,360
go into too many details

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,200
there um although i'll have a couple

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,799
both because i don't yet understand it

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,560
well enough and because this is a

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,039
lightning talk um

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
but his channel is worth checking out

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,280
both because it is just really cool and

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,000
interesting

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,800
and because it could actually apply to

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,760
programming

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,160
um there's another uh youtuber called

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,000
who

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,640
uh is called the conlang critic um

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,280
and that's his channel there um he also

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,920
does a

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,440
sort of comparison and contrast style

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,440
review of all of these different

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:38,239
artificial natural languages um

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,239
and natural instance of non-programming

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,760
languages and it's it's interesting to

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,360
look at that from sort of a programming

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,640
lens and think

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,200
what of those concepts apply to us and

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,640
and what don't and sort of how we can

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,640
have that sort of interdisciplinary

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,840
learning um

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,159
like i said given the format of this

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
talk i don't have time to go into very

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,800
many details

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,720
but i do want to give you just a couple

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
of tastes of the sort of things that

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,280
seem to come up when people are thinking

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
about

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,840
um constructed languages

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,360
one is uh some

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,519
languages can have what's called an

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,680
enclitic question particle

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,720
um which is a bunch of fancy words but

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,280
it basically means a suffix

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,480
like in finnish you can add co to the

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,280
end of a word

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,640
and and that makes it a question so you

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,799
know instead of having to say

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,480
did you go to the store you could say

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,840
you went to the store co

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,799
and and that would turn that sentence

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,640
into

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,480
or i guess it would be you went code to

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,400
the store but that would turn that

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,599
sentence into a question

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,640
um just by by prepending

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,040
uh the right suffix

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,640
if any of you have seen e-lisp or a

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,799
number of other languages that really

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,120
like to use predicates in their

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,040
you know to name a function that returns

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,040
a boolean with a p

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,159
or some languages support a question

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,439
mark at the end

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,200
you know so there's this same idea of i

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,040
want to turn what what looks like it

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,000
would be a statement into a yes no

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,080
question

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,200
in in programming uh the use of

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,519
predicate seems to map

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,840
on very well another really fascinating

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,359
concept that some languages both natural

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,120
and artificial

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,440
constructed have is a grammatical way to

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,840
denote inalienable possession

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,120
so you know speaking in english we have

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,040
possessive

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,479
that grammatically indicates that you

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,840
own something but

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,680
some languages uh have the the idea of

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,840
inalienable possession you possess

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,360
something

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,919
and you definitely possess it

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,160
and that seems to map somewhat onto

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,520
immutability but i will stop there

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,840
and encourage you to go explore

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,840
