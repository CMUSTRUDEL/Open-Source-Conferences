Title: Local dev setup for a complex app using docker-compose - Thomas Klausner

Description: 
	How to run a non-trivial app (API backends, DB, Cache, mail,  JS, https) on your local dev machine using docker-compose.

A normal app usually consists of much more components (or services) than just your backend. You'll need a database, maybe a cache, you want to send some mail, serve some JavaScript and run all of that behind https (yes, even on localhost). Add some microservices to the mix, and you end up having to configure and start a lot of things.

An easy(-ish) way to do this is via docker-compose.

In this talk I will show my current docker-compose best practices that enable me to have all of the above, for several different projects, without having to remember complex command line options.

While the backends are written in Perl, this talk will feature mostly YAML .. sorry :-)
