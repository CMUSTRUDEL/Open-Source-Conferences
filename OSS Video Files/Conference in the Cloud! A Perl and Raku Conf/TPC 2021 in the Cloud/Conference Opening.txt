everybody together

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,720

doing for the past 12 months

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,600
so just like last year we are hoping

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,000
to make this a conference

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,879
about you guys that this has always been

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
a

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,039
community event and we

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
want if if you have something you want

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,320

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,280
as part of this event uh please speak up

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,079
and

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,039
we we have a lot of uh ways that we're

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,480
trying to make this

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,680
uh conference more interactive

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,559
the the first thing i will talk

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,400
to you guys about is birds of a feather

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,600
this is a concept that goes back

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,560
to the very very early days of yet

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,200
another pearl conference and the idea

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,439
was that we would have

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,560
people who wanted to talk about a topic

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,119
they would just say hey

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,840
i'm here i want to talk about whatever

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,680
and

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,040
anybody who wants to talk about that

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,320
come over here

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,439
and that's all it was we are taking that

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,640
into the the cloud space with

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,000
we will have zoom sessions uh scheduled

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,200
actually as part of the conference

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,200
if you are interested in a certain topic

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,840

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,040
doesn't

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,640
so uh looking forward to those

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,400
there are some here are some links

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,519
that will help you enjoy the conference

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,239
better

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,560
the first one is the conference website

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,000
the second is sched where we are keeping

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,360
all of our schedule

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,239
information about what's going on

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,080
we have provided a invite to everybody

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,560
that we could

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,519
to join the pearl foundation slack as a

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,680
single

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,200
channel guest which means you are just

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,200
in pound pearl

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,120
some of you did not get that invite and

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,080
one of the reasons may be that you were

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,400
already a member

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,920
of tpf slack from last year or

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,200
previously

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,000
so you you may just have to go ahead and

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,800
log in to slack from the previous year

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,120
there's no way

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,000
for us to give an invite out if you're

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,560
already a member unfortunately

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,319
if you have any questions if if

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,879
everything else fails we still have

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,840
email

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,840
go ahead and email us admin at

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,840
pearlconference.us

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,920
proconference.us wiki is actually just a

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,280
link to

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,200
the github wiki anybody is allowed to

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,400
scribble on that wiki that's a way for

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,480
you to

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,599
customize the event or provide

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,000
information

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,640
that you think others would like to find

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,040
out

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,920
we have links on there already set up

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,959
where people can share their slides

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,720
we have job postings

00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,879
and several other things there is also

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,720
this last link which will take you to a

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,879
page where we've kind of outlined

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,480
some of the basics that people in the

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,920
past have had trouble with

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,280
that will hopefully get you uh

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,680
more comfortable with the conference

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,360
more quickly

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,720
the the first thing i'm going to show

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,479
you in sched is

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,320
if you're not familiar with it the two

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,799
most important things you need to do in

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,520
sched

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,720
is set your time zone because time zones

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,720
are hard and confusing

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,040
and they break my brain too

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,000
make sure you check off your talks so

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,320
that we can see who attended what

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,919
and also so that you can see what's

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,400
coming up for you

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,199
we are also using this as a mechanism to

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,960
talk to

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,639
to communicate with people so for

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,720
instance we've already had

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,320
some talks that had to get cancelled or

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,199
moved and we've been able to communicate

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,040
with the people

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,400
who checked off those talks and let them

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:59,759
know about the changes in the schedule

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,639
these these sessions are open uh you are

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,400
you can raise your hand uh using the

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,520
standard zoom mechanisms

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,560
you can ask questions in chat uh or

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,639
um and we as always we ask you to give

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,680
the speaker feedback after the talk in

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,000
sched

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,800
so that they can improve for future

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,360
years and so

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,960
also so the conference organizers can

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,639
make better choices about

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,440
the uh what what talks we're going to

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,440
give in the future

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,240
one of the features of slack that we

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,840
encourage you to use because we're only

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,960
unfortunately a single channel

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,440
slack this event is to

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,199
make use of threads and that way you can

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,160
have long running conversations without

00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:49,280
interfering with the single uh channel

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,320
um we also uh

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,600
also on the the

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,160
wiki we are hosting a virtual job fair

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,919
if you are hiring if you're a company

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,680
and you're hiring we encourage you to go

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,520
on there and provide information about

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,639
your company

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:10,319
uh we also have a page if people are

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,800
looking to be hired so go ahead and put

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,960
your information there and that will

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,240
that is a mechanism that companies can

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,120
use to find out about

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,240
you as always email admin at pearl

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,919
conference if you need

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,520
anything or have any trouble with

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,120
anything

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,240
we are also asking that you do something

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,479
that may be uncomfortable for you

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,360
we asked during the conference that you

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,479
turn these

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,680
on instead so that we can

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,520
communicate with you and and get

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,120
information to you when you need we know

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,840
that many of you have turned this

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,360
off from previous years we ask that

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,360
during the conference you turn it back

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,240
on simply so that we can communicate

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,919
with you

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,400
because we will be using scad to

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,400
communicate with you if we need anything

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,400
over the next few days

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,160
