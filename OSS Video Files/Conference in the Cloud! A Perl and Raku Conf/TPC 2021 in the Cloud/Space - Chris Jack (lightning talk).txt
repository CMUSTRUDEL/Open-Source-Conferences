uh hi i'm chris um this is my brief

00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,879
history of

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,919
um white space uh and some related white

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,800
space issues

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,120
um i think when i originally envisaged

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,880
it

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,000
um it seemed a better idea than it did

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,839
when i tried to write it down it's

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,400
getting it down to under five minutes

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,840
and keeping it interesting coherent is a

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,640
challenge but we'll see how we did

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,240
um before computers my great uncle tubb

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,720
used to run a typography

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
business this is in the 60s and 70s he

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,840
mostly printed business cards and

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,679
advertising flyers

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,120
when i was about 13 he offered to make

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,000
me some business cards and show me how

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,360
he did it

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,079
um basically you take um a frame and you

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,960
stuff it full

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,079
of as many letters as you can because

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,440
you don't want the letters to move

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,239
around

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,600
it's very visceral so you uh and

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,399
selecting lettuce is quite time

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,640
consuming

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,760
but it did encourage exploring the best

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,800
placement it gave you a lot of

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,320
flexibility

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,160
um because you have different size

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,480
letters so you can do small type

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,840
uh superscripts and subscripts um he

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,960
used larger

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,000
uh non-printing blocks to um

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,360
allow uh centralization

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,240
of letters quickly so he didn't have to

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,960
do like 20 um regular spaces

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,640
um and he also had thin spaces so if you

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,159
were left and right justifying you could

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,240
distribute the spaces

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,400
evenly between the uh

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,159
line so it didn't look lopsided um at

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,240
the same time type pride isn't common in

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,159
both business and domestically

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,920
they had three main space controls they

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,040
again had regular spaces for word

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,840
separation

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,680
um they had it a lot of them had a tap

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,799
tap mechanism where you had movable

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,119
metal bars

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,000
um and you released the carriage um and

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,640
it would move

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,240
forward to where the uh metal bar was

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,159
and this allowed you to

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,840
line up permanent indentation things

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,880
like um quotations

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,960
uh it had a return lever

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,119
for the carriage return um and you get a

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,240
ping near the end of a line

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,680
uh uh correcting errors and doing

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,200
solvent superscripts was

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,840
was time consuming um home computers

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,440
appeared in the late 70s using ascii

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,480
um uh

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,959
white space uh here was

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,560
um one of six carat uh carriage returns

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,160
and line feeds were similar to what you

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
got on a typewriter and

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,520
sometimes got uh a bit confused

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,319
horizontal tabs are under software

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,319
control

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,160
vertical tabs is the one that usually

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,239
surprises people because it's very

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,840
rarely used in programming but it was

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,480
quite useful for printing because it

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,680
allowed

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,239
the print mechanism to move down a line

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,879
without

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,360
changing the x um coordinate which could

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,760
save

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,480
a lot of time form feeds were very

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,200
useful

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,319
on uh dot matrix printers if you wanted

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,800
to print multiple

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,519
files out you could put a form feed

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640
between them

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,720
and you again had regular spaces um

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,160
print languages like postscript allowed

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,560
specification of

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,120
x y coordinates so you could fine-tune

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,280
um space widths but

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,239
the home printers are usually used if

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,440
you needed to

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,159
distribute spaces it would do

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,599
to two full spaces rather than trying to

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,360
subdivide the space

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,280
um and donald knuth who

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
was writing books on algorithms and

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,280
didn't like what the

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,040
word process of the times would be uh so

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,319
for instance the line breaking algorithm

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,760
for a typical word process

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,720
and this is still true for things like

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,680
words and um uh open office is

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,280
um you would type along until you got to

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,799
a position where the next word would no

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,640
longer fit on the line

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,440
um and it would start a new line

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,440
automatically for you

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,599
donald didn't like this because it

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,799
potentially created increased raggedness

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:49,040
so the top example here

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:52,799
shows what word might do for a six space

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,360
column he instead preferred to

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,360
uh do spaces over the entire paragraph

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,040
um so he wanted to minimize the square

00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,760
of the space left over at the end of the

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,599
line

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,920
so you'll see here what's happened is

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,560
that instead of having a zero a four and

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,480
a one

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,080
um which has a large discrepancy in the

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,480
number of spaces of four

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,760
he's reduced the discrepancy to two uh

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,720
by moving the bb onto the next

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,880
um i came across it when i was working

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,479
on a system to layout

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,479
classified adverts in australian

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,199
listings paper called the trading post

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,560
which is

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,800
similar to london's loot and i'm sure

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,720
you have others internationally

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,479
we had to implement canoes algorithm

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,240
both horizontally and vertically

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,639
um you've seen the um horizontal example

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,960
but

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,479
one of the requirements was to keep each

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,000
advert in a single column so you didn't

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,479
have half the advert at the bottom one

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,120
column

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,520
and half at the top of the next um so

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,680
this

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,000
meant that you had to have um uh

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,720
spaces between lines which would vary um

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,840
so again

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,520
across the entire paper um we did canoes

00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,199
on a horizon as well vertical basis

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,400
uh canoes

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,320
word process tech went on to have other

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,280
latest spacing innovations like

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,880
minimizing ink bleed between thin paper

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,120
by offsetting the text on

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,440
two sides of thin paper and keeping

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,280
translations in sync on opposite pages

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,039
so for instance you wanted to have bible

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,320
verses in two languages

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:26,000
um and keep the verses aligned okay so

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,320
now we jump forward to uh unicode um

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,440
you have all the ascii white space um

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,039
but it's added some

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,479
additional useful things so if you

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,800
wanted to keep

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,600
your numbers in line between two lines

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,880
you've got a

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,560
space which exactly the size of a figure

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,240
you have non-breaking spaces so if you

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,520
have something like chris jack and you

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,720
don't want to split the chris and the

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,960
jack over two lines

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,400
um you can put a non-breaking space um

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,720
between the two of them

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,160
you have a wide variety of variable with

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,720
spaces um

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,600
uh zero which spaces are useful if you

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,000
want to indicate

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
um in a word that uh this is a good

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
place for a line break

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,560
but you don't want to see a space in

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,960
other

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,479
situations uh you have special language

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,840
spaces uh which are

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,360
going to um you have a next line

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,039
character which is different to

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,160
uh character and line feed and a

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,160
paragraph second project

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,280
