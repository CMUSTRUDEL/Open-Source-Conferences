Title: Rescue and renew: how to get legacy open source projects unstuck - Sumana Harihareswara
Publication date: 2021-06-10
Playlist: TPC 2021 in the Cloud
Description: 
	You depend on scores of open source applications, frameworks, and libraries. One hasn't released for years. Another is struggling with a big rewrite or a difficult maintainer.

How do you get a legacy OSS project unstuck? Especially if you don't already maintain it? I've done it and I'll share how.

I've helped get several legacy open source software projects unstuck -- expediting releases, unblocking volunteer contributors, gathering first-time funding, and more. I'll share success stories (one only took 15 hours of work), and I'll discuss the 5 major ways OSS projects get stuck (strategy, team, interfacing, workflow, and money) and how to address each. And yes, a contributor who's never worked on the project before can be the catalyst that revives it or gets a long-delayed release out the door.

You'll come away from this talk with steps you can take to rescue and renew OSS projects - regardless of language, framework, or platform.

hello everybody thank you very much for

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,920
joining me today

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,759
at the pearl and rocky conference this

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,120
is rescue and renew

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:14,240
how to get legacy open source projects

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,359
unstuck um and my name is

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,880
sumona harihareshwara and i am

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:24,560
a project manager in new york city

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,760
specifically i run change set consulting

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,960
where i focus on short term

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,880
targeted project management services for

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,640
uh free and open source software

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,480
projects and the organizations

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,000
that depend on them so um in my

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,760
talk today i'm going to be talking a

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,120
little bit about

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,200
the uh i mean

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,640
legacy software really that's that's

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,200
primarily what i'm going to be talking

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,640
about

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,079
um because uh most of my work has been

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,559
with legacy software

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,120
i worked at the wikimedia foundation

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,520
with python with auto conf

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,600
and so i think of legacy as strangers

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,159
depend on it enough that you have to be

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,720
careful

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,720
when changing it uh and so today i'll be

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,840
talking about how to get a legacy open

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,200
source software project

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,000
unstuck let me

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,439
share with you the overview that you'll

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,640
be seeing today and this

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,000
is you know who i'll start with who i am

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,080
and who you are

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,479
uh i'll move on to talking about some

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,119
stories of uh wisconsin

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,960
autocomp and pippen three case studies

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,479
i'll talk about how projects get

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,079
stuck and unstuck and i'll ask you to

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,840
join me

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,840
so let me just see if there's

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,920
no okay um i see that uh chrome has

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,439
changed how it displays pdf since the

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,680
last time that i tested

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,200
so i hope this is okay and please speak

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,840
up in the textual chat

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,439
if there's something wrong with the view

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,640
here and then the screen size and

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,360
stuff like that of uh of my slides

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,000
so first as i mentioned i'm a project

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,599
manager

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,319
i'm a teacher i'm a consultant um and

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,040
i also sort of feel like frodo a little

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,560
bit in

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,239
the lord of the rings this is not going

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,080
to be the kind of talk where you need to

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,680
have an in-depth knowledge of all of

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,800
tolkien in order to understand it

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,239
but um there's this bit early on

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,599
where a bunch of people are trying to

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,200
figure out how are we gonna get this

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,080
really important thing accomplished it's

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,800
very hard

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
and frodo steps up and says i will take

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,680
the ring

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,480
though i do not know the way and i

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
always assume

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,319
like this seems to me like something he

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,879
says maybe with a lot of frustration

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,840
in his like i will take the ring though

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,400
i do not know the way

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,440
this is something i will step up because

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,360
somebody needs to

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,519
i have seen the problem and nobody else

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,319
seems to be stepping up i call this

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,599
damn it driven leadership as in damn it

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,840
someone's got to do this

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,920
and this is me and this is you honestly

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,480
like this is a fair amount of the things

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,000
that i've done

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,920
in life that could be called leadership

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,120
or like this right and maybe you're in

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,159
the situation as well

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,920
where you uh depend on scores of

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,280
open source applications frameworks

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,519
libraries and maybe one

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,800
hasn't released for years there's stuff

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,159
in the trunk

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,519
right people are developing it but there

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,440
hasn't been a release or there's another

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,120
one that's struggling with a big rewrite

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,280
or a difficult maintainer

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,040
um and maybe you want to get one of

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,799
those projects unstuck

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,319
expedite a release or deal with a team

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,159
member that everybody else is having

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,080
trouble with something else right

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,720
there's a problem no one else is

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,239
stepping up you're not the expert you're

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,440
not already one of the maintainers of

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,959
that project

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,799
but someone needs to step up if this

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,760
film is going to be solved and in open

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,480
source when the right

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,239
experts have a chance to work with

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,360
legacy projects

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,840
we can refresh their digital social

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
uh if not if necessary financial and

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,159
legal

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
infrastructure so so that they can

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,599
thrive and through my consulting

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
business i've helped get

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,599
uh new auto conf the python package

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
index and various other open source

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,720
products

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,080
unstuck over the last few years and i'll

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,680
share some stories of those

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,280
successes and one of them only took

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,159
about 15 hours of work

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,000
so today i'll talk about the five major

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,640
places that open source projects get

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,080
stuck

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
and how to address each and my hope is

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,199
you'll come away from this talk

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,479
with some steps you can take to rescue

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,680
and renew open source projects

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,880
regardless of

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,919
language framework or platform um

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,960
if one of you could possibly uh

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,919
say a thing such as hello

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,960
in the zoom chat uh that would help me a

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,960
little bit with that

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,720
that feeling of well i'm giving a live

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,639
talk and there's humans here

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,320
but i don't get to hear or from any of

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,600
you ah thank you thank you for saying hi

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,639
i appreciate it

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,840
so uh and i'm sorry for my uh

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,600
desperate and constant need for

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,680
validation that's probably not going

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,960
away but i'll apologize anyway

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,560
um so first ah people are saying

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,040
thank you so much um so uh next up i'm

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,440
gonna tell

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,520
a few stories right again you do not

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,759
need to be some kind of tolkien person

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,639
in order to to appreciate this talk this

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,800
is not gonna be

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,919
like i'm not gonna give you like 10

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,240
paragraphs about

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,440
trees or something nothing against trees

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,720
nothing against trees

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,520
um first let's talk about wisconsin so

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,080
i uh this is a time when i really helped

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,080
by

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,120
gathering information and helping people

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,280
make decisions

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,800
honestly mostly by unifying the to-do

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,440
list

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,000
in 2011 i had already been a project

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,320
manager

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,039
in proprietary software and some in open

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,320
source

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,360
and i was also a participant in

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,080
a really lovely feminist sci-fi fantasy

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,960
conference

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,080
called wisconn that happens every may in

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,639
medicine wisconsin

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,639
and the volunteers who develop a web

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,880
application to manage wizcon

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
had just a jumble of bug reports and

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,600
feature requests in

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,800
base camp google code old emails and

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,160
text notes

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,520
uh and one year they said they had a

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,680
session at the convention that said

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,120
hey we need help we need some help with

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,319
project management and just

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,960
uh getting getting everything

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,319
consolidated so over the course of about

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,080
three or four months

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,600
in 2011 i consolidated and organized all

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,720
of those to-do's

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,960
into a prioritized queue i put

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,960
all the code related issues into google

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,360
code and i kept the team

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,880
on one page like on the same page via

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,720
base camp updates and a weekly

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,720
conference call so by the end of it

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,080
people were much more aligned about okay

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,199
here's what needs to happen

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,800
here's what's next um so let me share a

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,600
couple of lessons

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,720
that i learned from that experience one

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,080
is

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,319
you really when you're doing something

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,360
like this you can make a big big

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,960
difference just by

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,880
doing what i think it was like opening

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,360
up all the drawers and looking

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,000
under the couch you know look for where

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,080
people are

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,479
actually stashing notes things to do

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,919
branches and so on and so on and don't

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,000
get distracted by

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,080
should don't get distracted by the idea

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,639
that well everybody should be putting it

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,039
here

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,639
no people there were people who

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,720
literally had things saved

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,160
as you know emails that had been sent to

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,639
them at some point

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,080
that they knew ought to go into the main

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,960
developer documentation but they weren't

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,639
there yet right

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,199
so being willing to do the

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,639
um you know the kind of tedious work of

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,400
gathering all that information

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,080
consolidating and synthesizing and

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,280
putting in the right place to make a big

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,639
difference

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,160
my second lesson is look dude did i love

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,360
google code at the time

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,360
no but it was what the people who were

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,160
actually contributing

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,560
most were using slash wanted to use out

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,319
of all

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,440
these different platforms that people

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,479
had done a little bit here in a little

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,800
bit there so

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,720
in my opinion try to pick whatever the

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
most people who are actually doing work

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,879
right now

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,400
want to use and consolidate on that if

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,280
you have an issue where you need to kind

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,319
of unify

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,879
a bunch of stuff and last

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,759
you know you don't have to be a lead

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,759
developer

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,960
to pick up certain prioritize and triage

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,879
and file tasks

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,319
and in fact it can be better if you're

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,960
not because

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,919
uh if at least one of the maintainers of

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,360
a project

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,440
or one of the leaders or someone who's

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,080
helping out in a managerial coordinating

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,879
capacity

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,840
is not actually that enthusiastic about

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,280
programming

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,120
that can be incredibly helpful i mean

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,680
look i can program but programming is

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,680
not

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,680
the primary thing i feel enthusiastic

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,200
about in group software projects

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,080
so when i see a bug that needs fixing

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,919
i'm not really tempted into doing that

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,760
which would draw me away from the

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,760
project management work instead

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,279
when i see a thing that looks like you

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,800
know a really well-defined

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,959
bug that needs fixing or a feature that

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,640
he's implementing i delegate it

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,080
i think about how to prioritize it i

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,399
think about who could do that work and

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,720
what processes and relationships

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,880
are needed to support them and i think

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,080
people who mostly want to write software

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,480
can lose focus on

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,160
the big picture of project success which

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,720
is why it's helpful to

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,000
have people with complementary interests

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,200
running a project

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,480
together that's the wizcon

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,519
story next uh let's talk about

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,360
autocomp so just briefly this is a story

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,760
about gathering funding

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,680
in some way and so it's about like when

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,040
you're paying people for the first time

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,399
you know we've been talking about this

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,839
for quite some time

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,000
in open source software and there's a

00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:29,920
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,440
article by benjamin mako hill called

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,920
problems and strategies and

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,760
financing voluntary free software so you

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,600
know there's

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,279
i i will also be directing you to uh

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,320
some some other stuff that i wrote about

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,920
uh grants and how to get them

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,680
i've written a bunch about this that is

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,640
all on the the page of past

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,279
talks that i've given um but today i

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,760
want to talk

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,480
primarily about getting corporate

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,920
funding

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,640
and the thing that i'm going to talk

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,680
about is autocom i'm pasting a link

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,079
in the zoom chat

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,880
uh to the the sort of case study that i

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,839
wrote for the

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,440
lwn linux weekly news magazine about

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,440
what we did for autocomp but

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,800
um just to give you some background for

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,279
those of us who

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,720
perhaps don't do that much with c and c

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,760
plus and similar languages

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,320
on the command line gnu auto conf is a

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,920
tool for producing configure scripts for

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,800
building installing and packaging

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,480
software on posix systems such as linux

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,560
it's a core component of the new build

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,720
system also known as auto tools

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,399
when a user installs a software package

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,800
on the command line by compiling it from

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,560
source

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,240
they're often instructed to run dot

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,120
slash configure make

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,120
make install and auto conf is what

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,320
creates that configure script the thing

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,680
that's called configure the very

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,640
beginning of that

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,760
it was founded in 1991 and it had

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,839
releases going on

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,959
at a pretty steady clip up until 2012.

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,640
on april 24th 2012 there was a release

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,760
of autocomp 2.69

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,959
and then there weren't any releases for

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,279
years even though

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,120
contributors were still contributing

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,800
patches and maintainers were still

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,480
merging them

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,959
but just no one had time to put out a

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,079
new release and in january 2020

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,200
keith bostick sent this email to the

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,079
public auto

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
mailing list saying is there someone we

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,519
could pay

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,279
to do a new release of the autocomp

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,560
toolset

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,279
so uh i have a friend named zach who

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,519
contributes to autocon and he saw this

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,120
and contacted me and we decided

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,880
that he and i you know changed that

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,839
consulting being me and then him being a

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,320
subcontractor

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,600
would say hey keith maybe we were could

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,760
be that person right

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,440
so in february we sent him an email and

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,160
started talking about a first engagement

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,959
and discussed

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,639
a discovery phase like all right let's

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,079
figure out what all the things are that

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,560
need doing

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,959
and so we got some money from keith to

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,279
do that and so we wrote a giant to do

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,040
you see where the scroll bar is here and

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,279
how there's a lot more

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,120
uh underneath it so we wrote this all

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,519
right if we were going to really do

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,560
everything to make this a really robust

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,079
ongoing project

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,760
there are some things and so then we

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,200
talked with keith and

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,079
uh were able to get some money from him

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,720
and some from bloomberg and some from

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,839
the

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,800
new auto sorry the the

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,079
the new tools tool chain fund at the

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,160
free software foundation

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:33,279
um all together uh in order to

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,639
do a subset of this um and

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,160
it took a long time uh

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,639
it took longer than we thought we

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,040
thought it would this is a picture from

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,920
uh star trek the next generation episode

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,279
where

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,480
an engineer a scientist is saying well

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,360
that's true but i'm sure it's the last

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,480
real problem

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,120
and we ran into that a lot uh

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,079
so um let me talk a little bit about

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,480
what happened there

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,720
well i mean we did finally zach released

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,880
uh the autocomp 2.70

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,920
version as of december 2020 later than

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,240
we thought we would

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,680
um but it's out right uh but it took so

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,160
long it took longer than we thought it

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,680
would so let me talk about some lessons

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,959
about what worked and thoughts on how to

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,360
get more of this

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,480
look for people who are already offering

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,959
look for people who are

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,000
already credible contributors or who

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,200
maybe have already even

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,959
said hey is there someone i can pay to

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,639
do a thing that everyone wants done

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,959
right not just a custom feature for them

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,800
but

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,040
them but something like you know a

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,639
migration or a release that everybody

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,680
really wants to have happen there may be

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,880
people who have already sort of raised

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,480
their hands and said could i pay for

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,399
this

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,519
second really watch out for fixed price

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,279
engagements right

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,040
uh zach and i got a certain amount of

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,959
money from

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,040
this this set of donors and then

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,760
it was a big time suck preparation for

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,079
the auto conf 2.70 release zach has said

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,160
took almost twice as long as anticipated

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,279
he made five beta releases between july

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,920
and december 2020

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,600
and he merged 157 patches most of them

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,000
bug fixes

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,240
and part of this is if you don't already

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,240
have continuous integration in place

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,519
then finding and fixing regressions can

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,079
be not just a time

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,800
suck but this unknown time suck right if

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,839
you don't have

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,519
automated which uh autocomp did not have

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,600
right it had there are automated tests

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,800
but it was not set up so that

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,920
a patch automatically failed until it

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,240
and you know the

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,120
um the trunk with with that patch merge

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,040
would pass

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,040
those automated tests so it would have

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,639
been nice to have that ahead of time

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,079
um and if you don't have it you got to

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,079
be really careful about the estimates

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,680
that you make

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,560
um now i want to talk about pip end

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,880
which does not have as much in the way

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,920
of

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,680
interesting uh screenshots and so

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,800
instead i'm just using this screenshot

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,760
from

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,360
an old tv ad evidently in like the 1980s

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,199
you could just literally put up a screen

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,800
that exciting things are happening and

00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,600
people would not i guess laugh that out

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,800
of the room

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,320
um so uh i'm putting into the zoom chat

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,360
a link to a bit of a case study that i

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,720
wrote that i'm basically going to

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,959
narrate to you now

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,920
about how i was able to use nudging

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,959
prioritizing

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,399
and communicating to help uh the

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,399
maintainers of pippen

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,639
so as of november 2018

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,839
there was uh you know a pip end release

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,720
there had been several

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,639
up until that point this is a an open

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,399
source project that is used to manage

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,639
application dependencies for people who

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,920
are

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,959
using python and then there wasn't a

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,240
release for a while

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:38,320
and at around march 2020

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,079
somebody suggest a community member

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,560
suggested hey since pip

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,839
hasn't had a release in a little while

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,680
maybe we should take it off such and

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,000
such a list of recommended tools

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,040
because it might be sort of unmaintained

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,279
i saw this

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,880
and i knew the right internet relay chat

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,920
channel to go into

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,360
to say hey dan who was the most active

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,839
or one of the most active maintainers of

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,040
tibet

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,399
at that moment i said hey dan what's up

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,240
with this what do you need

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,639
right um is there something blocking you

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,079
for making that release he said honestly

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,600
he said he just needed someone to keep

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,360
him on track because he kept getting

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,480
distracted and doing things that weren't

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,639
going to

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,240
be effective in helping make the release

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,959
happen he said i just need someone to

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
come like

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,000
ask me what i'm doing and if it isn't

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,600
the right thing then yell at me and i

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,399
said would you listen to such a person

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,800
he said

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,160
at first i would fight back and then i

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,560
would realize they were right and i

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,720
would

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,800
uh and i would listen to them i said oh

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,240
okay so

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,920
i over the course of three months

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,959
i nudged him uh a little bit

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,360
every few days uh in irc

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,199
i helped him by writing like the rough

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,880
draft the first draft of

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,480
some of his larger communications like

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,320
to the public mailing list

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,600
i helped update some of the github

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,800
issues including

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,720
updating or closing the is pippen dead

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,079
like questions thing no it is not dead

00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,440
here is where we are trying virus

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,440
i helped him by you know writing the

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,759
first draft of checklists

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,919
and uh and things like that right now

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,400
this was the occasional

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,120
irc nudge plus a few video calls and

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,039
some email

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,959
like i said overall it was about 15

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,160
hours over three months and during which

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,319
time he had to fix

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,160
various continuous integration issues

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,160
with like azure

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,839
and um deal with you know bug after a

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,199
bug that cropped up in certain

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:29,039
upstreams and things like that and then

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,360
in may 2020 he put out the release

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,440
uh this is the impossible but true

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,039
scripture also from one of these 80s tv

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,120
commercials these are fantastic

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,880
um and now there was and then there was

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,320
a release in june 2020

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,320
and then in august 22 and then in

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,520
november i mean it's it's back on track

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,400
you know so let me share some lessons

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,160
from that

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,799
one is that you can really do a lot with

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,600
a little right it only took about 15

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,880
hours

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,280
for me to do this uh and that

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,480
is infinitesimal compared to the value

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,559
that's unlocked

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,320
to the industry to hobbyists to

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,679
academics nonprofits

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,960
uh governments and so all these

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,799
different kinds of organizations that

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,000
use a fairly popular

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,559
python application dependency utility

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,600
and second if you have a good

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,160
relationship

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,640
with people who are maintaining a bit of

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,240
software

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,919
you can be honest with each other right

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,120
dan could be honest with me he had run

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,960
into me before

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,520
we knew each other a little bit so he

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,240
could be vulnerable with me and say

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,760
this is what i need he could share his

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,160
needs and so if you can

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,919
get that kind of relationship just by

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,400
being a known

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,840
person who engages in good faith and is

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,400
reliable

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,760
then you can honestly ask and then you

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,799
can fulfill that need and you can

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,440
complement

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,679
what's missing and so many times the

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,919
people who are leading these projects

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,200
they need a little bit of coaching a

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,640
little bit of cheerleading

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,880
a little bit of help with project

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,720
management you know a sidekick

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,160
right and if you can be that psychic it

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,520
can actually be

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,799
amazingly uh effective with with not

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,160
that much

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:09,360
actual clock time spent on it

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,440
i never touched the pip code

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,960
aside from making a couple pull requests

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,880
about the documentation

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,960
right i have never been a pip band

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,520
developer and yet i expedited this

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,480
release

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,679
and you can do that too so now let's

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,600
talk a little bit about how

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:28,640
projects get stuck and unstuck

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,240
um first i'll share some principles that

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,400
i often use when i'm thinking about

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,840
open source the tech industries and this

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,039
this work of getting projects

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,440
unstuck one is that there is no one

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,640
tech industry and there is no one open

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,760
source community

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:49,120
like a fruit packing company with an i.t

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,520
department a united kingdom national

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,280
government agencies developer team

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,640
and a silicon valley machine learning

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,360
startup have different

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,039
attitudes towards open source investment

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,960
and a 30 year old

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,039
systems programming tool with millions

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,840
of users has different opportunities

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,480
constraints

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,200
needs compared to a six-year-old library

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,520
that's

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,360
gluing a content management system to a

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,360
social media platform just for example

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:20,400
um second is that

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,440
skills are fungible right that

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,039
um domain knowledge can be learned

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,320
oh sorry first i'll talk about the fact

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,799
that open source contributors as a

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,240
population disproportionately want

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,600
to write code uh we have an easy time

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,280
finding or being found by people who

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,120
want to write features and fix

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,799
bugs and integrating those people into

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,840
our projects we have a harder time

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,679
attracting

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,760
and integrating uh the work of and the

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,520
people managers marketers testers

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,080
systems administrators

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,320
uh writers user experience researchers

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,000
and designers customer service experts

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,720
event planners and grant proposal

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,919
writers

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,840
and then working well with those people

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,000
and retaining them as well

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,200
and most people who become open source

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,679
project maintainers

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,640
did not start out wanting to do

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,320
maintenance

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,400
work right they usually wanted to make a

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,039
cool thing or solve their own needs or

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,000
fill a gap that was bothering them or

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,919
their peers

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,240
and then they generally had no training

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,360
and often have no inclination

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,440
to regarding long-term product strategy

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,039
uh customer and upstream relationship

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,440
building budgeting

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,360
seeking funding user experience work

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,159
lots of other necessary disciplines

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,000
in software leadership that does not

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,640
have to be a problem as long as folks

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,159
with complementary skills or people who

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,440
are learning or willing to learn those

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,919
complementary skills

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,559
can join in and co-lead these projects

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,120
with

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,840
people who got into it for i want to

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,280
make this thing

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,880
reasons um again i want to talk about

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,880
uh skills being fungible and so on um

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,919
i think sometimes we run into an idea

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,400
that

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,080
well these are the two people who built

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,400
this piece of software

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,880
so any major decision that has to happen

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,360
they have to be the ones to initiate it

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,240
and if they don't have time if they're

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,400
out of time

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,760
well then that's it uh there's there's

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,640
nothing that can be done that's just an

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,400
immovable

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,799
locker but actually uh just as they

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,000
do we're not born knowing those skills

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,880
right other people could learn those

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,600
skills that

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,240
even the most complicated hairiest code

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,120
base

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,960
could be learned by someone else um

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,360
especially if there were money available

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,520
to

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,720
for that person to train up as an intern

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,919
or as an apprentice

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,440
or as a sort of lieutenant uh

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,760
and you support them while they're in

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,760
that learning curve um

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,640
and therefore domain knowledge can be

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,159
learned and credibility can be earned

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,640
uh i again right i didn't i wasn't born

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,840
knowing

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,520
anything about python packaging um and i

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,360
earned that credibility over time

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,360
including earning credibility from

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,919
things i've done in other environments

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,679
right i worked on mediawiki and i

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,200
learned a bunch of skills working

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,200
in that environment and then a lot of

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,520
those skills were actually fungible

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,320
to working on python working on auto

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,640
conf and

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,000
and so on and so on skills are fungible

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,280
domain knowledge can be learned

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,799
credibility can be earned and every

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,400
open source project has a life cycle

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,400
right sometimes the best choice for a

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,760
project is to end it and many open

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,840
source projects and

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,200
really through quiet attrition the

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,919
founders acknowledging

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,280
reality years after it ought to be

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,919
evident if they ever make a public

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,320
statement

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,640
um and far better for contributors and

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,520
users is a planned and announced end of

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,000
life

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,600
giving users a heads up is respectful

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,360
and it frees them to figure out a new

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,240
path including maybe a fork under new

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,400
management

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,760
and choosing to actively end a project

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,600
frees contributors

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,320
to move on to project that can engage

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,440
with their work and deliver it to users

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,919
knowing that knowing that ending is an

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,559
option can sort of free us to think

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,400
about all right

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,600
why should this project move and if it

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,440
should let's actually have some

00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,919
increased vitality knowing that it's not

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,039
just

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,320
inertia right uh it's not just the

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,919
lowest effort option

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,760
or ideally it's not right um and and

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,880
come towards it with some more purpose i

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
think it would be great if there were

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,480
more

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,000
sun setting consultants who you could

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,720
hire who would help you

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,240
you know wind down a project in a way

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,799
that was reasonable for you

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,279
and your your downstreams it's just an

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,240
idea in case someone wants to grab that

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,840
so that uh covers some of the premises

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,919
that i usually work with so now let's

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,760
talk about five major areas where legacy

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,320
projects get stuck

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,080
i i think of these as strategy team

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,000
interface workflow and money

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,360
so we'll talk a little bit about each of

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,120
those what sort of like

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,200
how it becomes stuck in some questions

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,720
and tasks so with strategy

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,960
the main question is why should this

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,120
project exist and based on that

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,000
what should we prioritize how it could

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,400
become stuck

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,080
like if a project started to solve one

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,520
person's problem and now

00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,200
other people with other motivations

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,200
co-lead it they might not

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,640
realize that they disagree about what's

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,559
important and what's urgent

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,320
so this can lead to frustration when

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,320
people have different standards for what

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,840
features to work on how fast to merge

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,400
contributions and what to deprecate and

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,279
when

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,080
so in the sort of strategy umbrella as i

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,840
think of it

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,679
you also run into questions like well

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,039
what work do we need to prioritize and

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,279
how urgent is it

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,880
what is our goal and should this project

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,720
exist should we decommission it

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,919
has the team actually agreed on these

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,120
things so

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,400
a fundamental task regarding strategy is

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,799
to assess the project's goals health

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,880
and environment and competition and

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,080
check whether the team is agreed about

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,880
what's important let me give you an

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,760
example

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,919
uh when i was working on the overhaul of

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,960
the python package index

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,640
uh we were really a huge is a huge huge

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,120
next generation rewrite

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,000
the old version of this web application

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,159
had open id login

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,360
in order for us to get closer and closer

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,880
to uh

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,480
putting up the new site as production

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,400
and decommissioned the old one we had to

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,039
make some hard choices about what is

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,720
complete

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,159
right are we going to be feature for

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,760
feature at parity with the old version

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,279
and one of the things that we cut was

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,720
open id login

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,720
right because we decided that's not

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,240
that's not core to our mission um

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,440
that was a difficult decision right

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,000
there were people who loved open id

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,840
login

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,360
but we had to make some in order to

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,799
actually deploy

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,559
on budget next let's talk about team

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,960
the main question here is who maintains

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,480
this project and what do they need

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,039
so how could this get stuck uh here's

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,000
one scenario let's say one team member

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,799
is so hard to negotiate with they block

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,120
other people

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,360
from coming on board or implementing

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,440
important improvements

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,679
please feel free to just sort of say nod

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,200
in the chat if you've maybe run into a

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,840
situation like that

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,200
uh or maybe conversations about big

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,919
architectural changes

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,120
drag on for a long time maybe even years

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,240
because people aren't sure what the

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,520
decision criteria

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,600
are or who will make that final decision

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,279
uh and some other questions might be do

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,480
we have enough maintainers to do the

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,760
essential work

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,520
and do we have up and coming

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,679
contributors who can replace us

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,039
as maintainers in the future does

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,720
everyone know

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,240
who has what powers uh or uh are

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,480
some people confused about who has the

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,039
power to do certain things

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,600
do we run into team workflow problems

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,360
when

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,640
different groups want to participate at

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,399
different speeds

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,919
is there maybe a difficult team member

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,000
who needs handling

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,360
and do we have the social processes that

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,159
we need to support the project and each

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,480
other like

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,320
meetings mentorship programs and

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,039
requests for comment

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,919
so the task here is to understand who

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,000
does what

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,760
resolve confusion and conflict and set

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,200
up ways to prevent future

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,520
confusion conflict let me give you an

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,720
example when i was at the wikimedia

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,840
foundation

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,320
uh we sometimes dealt with

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,480
questions about shall we make such such

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,440
a big change to the architecture

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,000
that we're bigger than could be

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,720
reasonably

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,080
handled in an individual patch review

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,240
process it was

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,200
but if we did it over email to make sure

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,720
lots of people

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,279
could take part and take a look at it

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,520
that didn't really have a built-in

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,559
drive to completion so we created a

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,960
process for

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,559
requests for comments which involved a

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,640
meeting every couple of weeks

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,840
with some key people so that we could

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,120
have a

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,640
um a way a process right a lightweight

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,480
process for people to shepherd these

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,320
proposals for major changes

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,159
in such a way that they wouldn't just

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,760
get left hanging and fall through the

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,240
cracks

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,960
what i call interface is the question

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,039
who are

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,520
our users and partners and potential

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:46,000
contributors and what do they need

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,080
so for instance this can become stuck if

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,559
the team doesn't consistently listen to

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,360
and communicate with groups that they're

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,600
working for

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,200
and with then they're likely to miss

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,679
important information and make the wrong

00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,320
decisions and lose usage and trust

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,399
so some questions here would include who

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,000
are our partners and upstreams

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,159
uh do new contributors fall through the

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,679
cracks are we listening to them are we

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,559
responding quickly enough to their

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,480
concerns

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,159
do they have a way of listening to us

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,919
like an announcement email list do we

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,399
talk to each other

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,399
so a task here would be to identify the

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,720
main stakeholders and actors

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,320
and make it easier for the team to

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,240
listen to and talk with them about their

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,120
goals expectations and needs

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,960
so for example uh when again when i was

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,600
at the wikimedia foundation

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,159
uh one thing that we had difficulty with

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,559
was

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,320
all right wikimedia maintained the main

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,399
media wiki installation right that

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,000
wikipedia ran on and yes we always got

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,760
those words mixed at once

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,760
um and but you know media wiki itself

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,279
is a bit of software that a tremendous

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,880
number of people use

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,480
standalone right they install their own

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,039
wikis and there were

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,919
consultants and vendors and so on who

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,080
provided

00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,840
media wiki support services but we

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,960
didn't have a good way of talking to

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,720
those people because they're you know

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,000
they're stakeholders in the media wiki

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,360
product itself and

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,880
uh so i actually worked with an intern

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,200
via the outreachy internship program who

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,640
basically her project was find the third

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,240
party users

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,520
talk with them and sort of like gather

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,720
them together so that we could talk to

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,720
them in one place and that

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,960
has started that started initiative that

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,679
is now continuing in a different form

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,039
uh where uh media wiki vendors and

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,919
consultants can sort of have their

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,520
voices heard in a group

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,039
next i want to talk about workflow which

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,399
is like digital workflow

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,240
are the tools set up to support our work

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,080
so for instance let's say contributors

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,679
started the project on an old platform

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,880
that doesn't really integrate

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,080
conversation patches and review together

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,919
and no one's put in the effort to

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,200
integrate them or migrate to

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,799
a platform where those things are

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,520
connected so things fall through the

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,760
cracks

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,600
or people have started multiple

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,640
discussion venues and it's really

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,480
tiresome to

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,559
duplicate and interlink engineering

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,080
discussions among them

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,720
so some questions related to this might

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,519
be do we run automated tests on every

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,600
patch

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,720
do new issues patches and discussions

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,559
get interlinked

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,480
so that developers and users can easily

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,360
follow up are there bottlenecks or

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,279
duplications

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,399
in the platforms that we use to respond

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,880
to issues

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,679
review code and discuss this project in

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,720
general

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,480
so a task here would be assess

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,760
developer contributor and maintainer

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,840
experience

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,799
and upgrade the tools and platforms to

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,240
reduce toil

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:35,360
for everyone you heard what i said about

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:39,679
autocomp earlier in uh today's talk

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:42,799
and after working on the 2.70 release

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,200
zach wrote up a an assessment of not

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:48,320
just auto cough but the entire

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,880
new auto tools build system and

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,480
was able to say look here is how the

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,440
fact that we don't have continuous

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,880
integration

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,159
is hurting us um yeah i say someone

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,000
mentioning toil is an

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,159
awesome work yeah i think uh we're

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,679
seeing more from the devops

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,679
movement right and uh software

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,399
reliability engineers sres

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,399
uh the idea that when you can reduce the

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,760
kind of labor that is tedious and that

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,360
computers are better doing

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,120
better at doing the humans right that's

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,640
such a win like expanding

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,440
human capability finally i want to talk

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,200
about money

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,200
uh because money can help

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,559
right you look at the what happened with

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,320
autocomp for instance

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,600
and um what's happening with a number of

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,399
other projects that i've worked on

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,399
sometimes as a volunteer sometimes paid

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,080
it's a good thing to ask do we have the

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,440
necessary plans and

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,000
income or plans to get income to make

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,799
project

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,159
progress so this can become stuck

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,039
because let's say a team

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,120
is used to working all volunteer and

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,279
hasn't imagined what chunks of work

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,880
could be done by hiring new contractors

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,159
or the existing team doesn't have

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,960
connections to

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,000
the open source program officers funding

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,240
agencies

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,840
uh or the open source program officers

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,640
at corporations and

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,480
and funding officers at uh grant giving

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,480
program and benefactors and so on

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,000
so questions here would include do we

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,320
have enough money

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,559
to do what we want to do have we

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,279
developed plans or proposals to turn

00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,000
money into progress can we persuade

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,640
funders

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,480
to give us money and so a task here

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,760
again this is something that you don't

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,120
have to be a lead developer to do

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,200
sometimes it's even better

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,279
if you come in with learners mind right

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,200
and you're not already sort of in a rut

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,600
of well this is the way we do things

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,679
um the task here can be assess the

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,760
current budget and roadmap

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,440
research possible funders and propose

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,960
and execute funded work

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,880
i'm going to share something from the

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,279
python world and i'd love

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,559
for people to tell me during q a whether

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,960
this is something that

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,159
uh could possibly is already doing

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,640
really well in pearl

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,480
or maybe it could be done better but uh

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,240
there is a working group

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,840
a volunteer working group under the

00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,519
python software foundation

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,880
called project funding working group

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,600
which just tries to collect

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,679
information about uh funding

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,159
opportunities that are available for

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,359
software uh software projects that need

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,440
some some extra funding

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,119
whether these are grants or sponsorships

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,320
or whatever

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,040
and when it comes to very large ideas of

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,000
things that

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,520
um could take you know could really

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,599
benefit like the heart of python

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,040
can work with uh the development the

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,280
the sort of fundraising person at the

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,879
foundation to write and submit

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,480
these proposals to the big grant

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,560
agencies if that's possible if that's

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,200
necessary so i've just shared a link in

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,760
zoom

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:42,320
for that so now uh i want to talk about

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,159
the sequence now i want to be brief

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,679
about this but i'm going to go into more

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,480
detail on this in a book that i'm

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,560
writing

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,679
um and so i'm happy to talk with people

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,760
outside of this to

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,960
share like some draft chapters and

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,879
things like that um

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,960
but i think the way you set yourself up

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:59,040
for success is to follow the sequence of

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,880
settling i'm assuming here that you're

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,760
not already a maintainer of this project

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,920
right this is all

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,119
you care about a project your frodo like

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,000
how do you get in there and how do you

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,680
make change

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,680
you settle in you take charge you make

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,640
change you pass the baton

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,880
so settling in is doing routine tasks

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,640
that do not require much trust

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,079
so that you can assess things and earn

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,000
credibility you're

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,920
taking initial project audit or

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,040
inventory and you're taking on routine

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,960
responsibilities

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,560
you're learning the people you're

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,599
informally conversing with the people

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,040
who brought you in

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,720
you're understanding conversation

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,760
platforms and expectations you're

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,880
building trust

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,839
you're mapping the projects position and

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,599
velocity you're

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,119
placing the project in context and

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,800
you're maybe conducting

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,160
uh some kind of analysis like a

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,800
strengths weaknesses opportunities

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,880
threats analysis

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,920
next you're taking charge which means

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,599
you're doing things that require trust

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,720
but that the group has already agreed

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,000
needs to happen there's already

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,079
consensus for this

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,040
this might be things like release

00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,599
communication and

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,520
issue management uh setting priorities

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,800
making releases replying to issues that

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,040
require some diplomacy

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,560
running meetings uh dealing with

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,200
existing budgets just getting your head

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,440
around what is

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,359
if we have an existing budget what is it

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,079
noticing and dealing with people issues

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,079
among your existing teams this would be

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,200
growing and promoting promising

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,079
contributors

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,839
uh working really well with people maybe

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,040
there are neuro atypical

00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,640
contributors who haven't been allowed to

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,920
blossom fully because they haven't had

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,520
accommodations

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,200
um helping maybe colleagues who are

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,000
less reliable understand how they can

00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,079
get more reliable coaching and excluding

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,599
malicious or negligent people

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,000
understanding and dealing with people

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,280
who

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,200
are actually in the midst of trying to

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,240
do a power grab um

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,480
and uh i would also say that managing

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,079
rhythm mismatches what i call cadence

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,760
sheer in participation

00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,040
also goes in this when when different

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,720
people different groups of people want

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,760
to participate at very very different

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,040
speeds

00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,960
and another thing that you can do at

00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,839
this stage is you can help guide new

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,160
contributors

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,640
who need guidance including teaching and

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,079
including unskilled volunteers

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,240
which is actually you know there are

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,599
ways too when people are not

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,200
particularly skilled in

00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,359
the domain of software engineering and

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,800
want to contribute there are ways to

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,079
work with them in a way that's

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,079
complementary for everyone

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,520
and then once you actually have uh

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,119
more you know now let's say that you are

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,280
one of the maintainership team or at

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,440
least something of a trusted advisor

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,359
um you can start to make change which

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,680
means modifying and adding

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,640
infrastructure that helps everybody do

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,599
their work better

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,119
and infrastructure to me isn't just you

00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:39,520
know servers and bridges and things like

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,560
that

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,960
it's uh the the undergirdings right

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,800
that allow us to do our work so social

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,560
infrastructure can help address team and

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,320
interface issues for instance

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,920
using and improving your use of

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,560
mentorship programs like

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,200
google summer of code and outreachy

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,280
finding ways to use in-person time well

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,040
uh maybe or you know watch the

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,200
synchronous time well

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,280
helping this team with responsibility

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,720
audits checking okay what are what is it

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,079
you have on your plate what and

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,160
is it too much and should we take

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,320
something else adding and improving

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,079
codes of conduct uh dealing with

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,000
governance and related changes

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,200
maybe developing a request for comment

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,480
process improving user and stakeholder

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,160
communication and

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,839
listening channels adding user

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,280
experience and product management

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,280
activities

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,760
um and along the way using those to feed

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,520
into changes that influence people

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,800
in order to get the strategy section

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,960
right unstuck the

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,280
this is the long-term way that you make

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,000
sure that on on a consistent basis

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,920
you actually have an ongoing and living

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
strategy

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,079
uh digital infrastructure is you know

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,520
increasing work capacity i'm not really

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,119
talking so much about

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,440
improving the core code base of the

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,240
project talking about all the stuff

00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,640
that makes the project possible all of

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,960
the platforms and processes you use

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,240
to work on the code and related

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,320
artifacts so this is

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,160
gathering and unifying platforms kind of

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,560
like what i did with wizcon

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,760
um improving bug tracking and other user

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,280
support interfaces

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,200
improving code review and related

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,040
processes automating

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,400
workflow testing documentation with

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,960
continuous integration

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,000
and bots kind of like what zac and i

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,560
will be working on

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,480
continuing to work on for autoconf

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,480
financial infrastructure so this is

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,760
how to start thinking about budgets and

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,760
money writing

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,599
grant and other funding proposals and

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,760
considering crowdfunding

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,960
tidelift drip funding and things like

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,119
that

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,480
and legal infrastructure might come up

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,000
right maybe getting a legal

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,760
organizational home

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,599
dealing with questions about licenses

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,640
and trademarks sometimes

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,560
is relevant and finally part of

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,599
sustainability means the ability to

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,720
leave

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,480
uh sustainability you know you're gonna

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,720
need to assess

00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,800
the sustainability of a project so that

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,520
you can try and make it more resilient

00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,200
and then

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,640
leaving includes you know finding your

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,520
successors saying

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,640
no responsibly stepping away including

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,040
realizing when

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,760
to do so this is all part of that life

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,160
cycle right

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,359
almost certainly you will have other

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,560
responsibilities that come up in your

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,880
life you want to be able to put stuff

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,200
down so you can take out new stuff

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,480
and in my opinion you sort of have to do

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,160
it this way

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,839
uh in terms of um

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,680
you know you have to get if you're not

00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,839
already a maintainer right

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,359
then you got to think well if you were

00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,760
the maintainer of a project and somebody

00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,200
came

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,640
maybe with a bunch of bright ideas and a

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,079
lot of enthusiasm you want to you know

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,920
you're careful right you think abandon

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,359
wanted handing the keys over to someone

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,440
else right

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,040
so and that's why when you're going

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,400
through this process

00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,319
it's really helpful if you can

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,480
demonstrate that

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,839
power for the sake of power is not your

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,880
goal right

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,720
that you want basically what everybody

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,680
wants what everybody on their best days

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,920
wants right they

00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:01,040
want uh to to serve the users

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,640
and to make a good robust thing right

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,480
so when people have conversations when

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,079
issues come up arguments come up about

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,680
engineering questions of architecture

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,240
code style which platform views

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,359
it can be really helpful if your main

00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,160
opinion

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,040
is well this is blocking us so i want to

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,280
facilitate

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,319
us getting this resolved and you're not

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,359
that attached

00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:24,880
to any one answer so much as well let's

00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,720
get this result so we can move forward

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,480
of course if questions come up that have

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,760
to do with your core values

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,680
then of course you need to stand up and

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,040
be authentic right um

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,839
but if your main concern

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,119
really isn't do we use this dependency

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,960
versus that dependency

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,640
it can be really helpful if you keep

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,599
your eye on the prize of what it is that

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,079
you really care about

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,200
and and focus on that in how you

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,079
interact with other people and the

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,440
communications that you make

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,960
that is in my opinion uh

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,560
you know some wisdom that i've learned

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,880
over the past several years about how to

00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,839
get

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,800
open source projects unstuck what how

00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,640
they get stuck

00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,560
what some of the court issues are how we

00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,839
get them unstuck and so i'd love for you

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,280
to join me

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,960
uh i am working as i say on a book um i

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,800
i think these tools and practices and i

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,319
hope this book will help so that not

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,040
just lead developers and founders but

00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:18,160
anyone

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,880
can can be frodo um and

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,480
the i have a i'm working on this book i

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,160
do not know when it will come out i'm

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,040
talking with publishers now

00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:31,359
and but you can get right now a free

00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,800
38-page sampler of some of the early

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,960
chapters in case you want to

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,839
grab that so i just put a link in the

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,160
chat here

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,440
um and you know i'd love to know what

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,040
you think of that what

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,560
you know if you'd like to know some of

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,920
the other stuff that i'm writing a lot

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,599
of the stuff that i've talked about in

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,440
today's talk i'm gonna try and write

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,880
more in detail with like okay here's how

00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,440
you do this step here's how you do this

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,079
step

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,800
in the book so please contact me with

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,839
ideas

00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,440
experiences and thoughts um i am at

00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:01,680
changeset.nyc so that is

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,200
it for my prepared material i think

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,920
since we started a few minutes late we

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,560
probably have

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,040
about five or six minutes for questions

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,040
is that right

00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,839
todd

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:25,680
that's correct fantastic all right um

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,400
i don't think i see

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,280
whether anyone has using the hand up

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,599
functionality

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:37,119
in zoom to ask um

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,119
to ask a question um

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,319
i don't i don't quite know how people

00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,839
have been doing that here with uh with

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:44,160
the pearl conference so

00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:45,520
um since uh i think no one has asked a

00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,119
question yet if you have a question i

00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,599
think you could go ahead and just uh

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:55,839
just

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:55,839
say it

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,440
i i have a question uh this is brett

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,720
estrad

00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,800
so uh you're you're here and uh you're

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,880
obviously familiar with open source and

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,000
and i presume to some degree the pearl

00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,880
community

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,359
have in your time i guess observing us

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,560
in the wild and here and whatnot

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,200
are there any areas in which um you know

00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,760
you think

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,200
you think that we need to improve things

00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,720
or processes

00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,640
uh because there's certainly you know a

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,880
number of things that you could say or

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,319
i would i would say are stuck uh and

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,000
probably most would agree

00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,760
but are there anything are there things

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,960
that you see as stuck within the pearl

00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,800
community and and

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,240
you know do you have suggestions or some

00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,599
paths forward to to

00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,480
help us out um i want to you know i want

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,640
to back off and

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,680
and say i am a little bit familiar with

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,839
the girl community

00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,880
i forgot to mention that the wisconsin

00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:53,440
application

00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,119
that i worked on um back in 2011 for

00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,800
instance is written in pearl

00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,400
um i use dream with which is a pearl

00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,480
project you know i use and

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,760
interact with some pearl projects but

00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,440
certainly the majority

00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,520
of my work for the past several years

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,200
has been in php

00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:12,240
python c and and so on um

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:15,200
but you know so i wanna i wanna say

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,000
i certainly don't have the familiarity

00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,680
with

00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,079
um the sort of broad scope of different

00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,760
uh pearl open source projects that like

00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,560
large and small and different domains

00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,800
and and uh

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,920
and topic areas that i'm sure a number

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,119
of you have

00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,160
uh that being said um

00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,160
i think that

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:41,440
if i i could be wrong but i think that

00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:44,000
a uh an area where

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,800
in general pearl open source projects

00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,119
and

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,560
uh the the pearl ecology as a whole

00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,839
could improve

00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,359
is with the team aspect of

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,200
the the five stucknesses that i

00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:59,599
mentioned and in particular

00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,640
um on having a really good engagement

00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,760
funnel

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:07,200
for attracting new contributors

00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,720
bring them in and retaining them for

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,720
for projects and i'd love to know if you

00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,240
think i'm wrong please let me know if

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,000
you think you know what actually pearls

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,280
pearl and pearl projects are really

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,079
strong at that please tell me

00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,720
but i think that's the sense that i get

00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,920
is

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,920
a general um

00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,079
there is a willingness among pearl open

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,839
source projects in general there is a

00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,839
willingness like hey yeah if someone

00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:32,960
came by and wanted to learn

00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:35,599
we would teach them but engagement

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,319
in a more systematic way is maybe a

00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,839
little

00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,760
and and making sure that there's like

00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,520
attention to retention

00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,200
i think might be a little bit more like

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,319
that's that's currently my thought

00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,319
okay thank you and and i don't i'm not

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:49,839
i don't agree or disagree with you i i

00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,319
was literally i think good

00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,440
i hear you hearing your your opinion

00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:56,640
with fresh eyes

00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,760
is valuable so um anyway thank you for

00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,839
the answer

00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,960
thank you thank you yeah as i want to

00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,280
say like other people

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,240
who have a much broader view if you if

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,000
you have a different view you're

00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:10,000
probably right

00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,160
jim keenan has a question

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,359
more of a comment than a question it's

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,960
confident

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,960
wait i'd like to get questions first

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,040
thanks okay very quick question from me

00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,839
then

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,720
uh you were talking about the python

00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,520
process

00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,280
we have a grants committee process where

00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,880
it's essentially passive

00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,240
you say send us your grant request and

00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,599
we'll evaluate it

00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,920
and vote on it

00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,520
the python process is that more active

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,920
where they go and beat the bushes

00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,040
trying to find places where money would

00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,800
be helpful

00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,800
so i wanna i wanna clarify i'm really

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,359
sorry that i was uh unclear about this

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,960
because i

00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,880
uh i totally get what you're saying so

00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,800
the pearl foundation and the python

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,000
software foundation as well as i think

00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,599
the the ruby

00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,040
a similar organization with ruby and a

00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,400
number of other organizations for other

00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,559
languages and frameworks

00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,920
directly give out grants that is

00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,359
something that pro foundation does and

00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,559
it's something psf does

00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:10,800
um and i think probably both perl and

00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,319
python software foundations uh you know

00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,160
do some amount of publicity

00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:17,280
right and outreach around that grants

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,280
process there's also in addition to that

00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,280
in the python world there is this

00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,720
additional thing called this project

00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,000
funding working group

00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:29,359
which is trying to collect information

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,440
about other funders that

00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,359
are interested in funding open source

00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,079
work and then doing some amount of

00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,640
outreach

00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,520
to try to connect that with projects

00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,079
that might not

00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,359
have the kind of need where the psf

00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,280
grant would be a good fit

00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,400
but maybe one of these other grants

00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,880
would be a good fit

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,400
uh so for instance the yeah the mozilla

00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,280
open source software

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,559
uh or open technology fund opportunities

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,559
would be examples of

00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,680
projects where um this this other

00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,040
working group would be sort of more

00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,760
involved in helping people think about

00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,720
that and

00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,720
um and stuff like that

00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,319
thank you great

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,520
i think i think it worked out that uh

00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,079
jim

00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,760
either had to say his comment or go but

00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,920
hopefully

00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,440
he'll be good about sending it to you uh

00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,359
as part of the feedback

00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,760
i i hope i didn't come off as too harsh

00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,200
i just wanted to make room for questions

00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,960
i think he wouldn't have taken it

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,400
harshly if you know

00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,240
it's something i haven't seen before and

00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,720
i as a speaker i

00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,359
i heard you do it and i said oh maybe

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,720
sometime i should do that

00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,640
well they make it easier when when

00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,599
people are saying this is more common

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,520
than a question they're sort of

00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,079
prefacing it it's like a good handshake

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,280
kind of

00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,640
they're declaring their metadata you

00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,839
know does anyone else have a question

00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,839
that they'd like to share

00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,040
all right we're at six minutes till and

00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,280
i think they'll need the channel so

00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,760
yeah yeah all right thank you everyone

00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,040
so much uh uh so i have a question when

00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,839
do you come to fosdem

00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,280
uh i'm not sure when i'll come again i

00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,680
have been in the past i'd like to come

00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,839
again

00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,839
uh when travel's easier and everything

00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,960
uh and i'm gonna get clock club flat

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:12,079
which is wonderful

00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:15,200
and uh someone asks about connecting

00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:18,720
pdl with num focus and

00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,400
trying to see if there's anything um

00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,760
num focus does have a public email

00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,760
address in case that's helpful

00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,559
all right uh i guess that's uh that's it

00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,160
for today um i really appreciate getting
