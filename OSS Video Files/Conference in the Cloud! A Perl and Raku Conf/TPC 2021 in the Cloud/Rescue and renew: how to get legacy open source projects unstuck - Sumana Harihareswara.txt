Description: 
	You depend on scores of open source applications, frameworks, and libraries. One hasn't released for years. Another is struggling with a big rewrite or a difficult maintainer.

How do you get a legacy OSS project unstuck? Especially if you don't already maintain it? I've done it and I'll share how.

I've helped get several legacy open source software projects unstuck -- expediting releases, unblocking volunteer contributors, gathering first-time funding, and more. I'll share success stories (one only took 15 hours of work), and I'll discuss the 5 major ways OSS projects get stuck (strategy, team, interfacing, workflow, and money) and how to address each. And yes, a contributor who's never worked on the project before can be the catalyst that revives it or gets a long-delayed release out the door.

You'll come away from this talk with steps you can take to rescue and renew OSS projects - regardless of language, framework, or platform.
