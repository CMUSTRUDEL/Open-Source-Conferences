Description: 
	The talk will show step by step how I was able to run a simple Plack application on a Virtual Private Server, including the firewall configuration, module installation and using Let'sEncrypt to enable HTTPS.

You don't want to have a server at home running all the time. Or your ISP doesn't guarantee a static IP address. Or you can't run a compiler in your hosted solution to install the needed XS module.

Rent a virtual server. Configure it yourself and install what you need. I'll show you how I was able to run a simple Plack application on a VPS for â‚¬53/year, including the firewall configuration, module installation and using Let'sEncrypt to enable HTTPS.
