Title: Life after Perl (and Raku) - Peter Sergeant
Publication date: 2021-06-09
Playlist: TPC 2021 in the Cloud
Description: 
	Worried about finding your next Perl job in a shrinking market? This talk explores what’s awesome (and what sucks) about popular other stacks and how to future-proof your career.

Perl isn’t dead, and Perl isn’t dying, but the number of pure Perl dev jobs is continuing to shrink.

This talk looks at the technical features of several popular technical stacks (spoiler: testing and documentation suck, and there’s no Moose, but async is pretty cool) as well as market outlook for each.

It also talks about future-proofing your career - strategies for helping you to leverage your outstanding Perl skills in the context of a shrinking number of pure Perl jobs.

	00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,000
all right

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:12,160
good uh good morning good afternoon

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,400
wherever you are so this is a talk

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,679
about future proofing your programming

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,800
career if you are

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:22,240
currently a full-time personal developer

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,000
doing it for money um

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,599
and personally i've done some form of

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,560
public programming

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,000
virtually every day since i was 14 which

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,960
isn't that far off 25

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,079
years um and i imagine that's not

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,760
particularly unusual

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,440
in this crowd and in that time i've been

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,920
pretty lucky to be getting paid for

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,600
writing pearl virtually every day since

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,200
i was 18. and while i've taken the

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,360
occasional year or two off

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,640
to pursue other interests it's not a

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,399
huge stretch to say

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,360
i've been full or part-time employed as

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,480
a pearl developer for the last 20 years

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,719
um so today

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,480
i'm still getting paid to write pearl um

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,719
but i also work with recruitment market

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,000
data and i also run the only world focus

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,000
recruitment agency

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,200
which i've been doing for the last seven

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,840
years

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,799
um now

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,280
oops i feel like i'm somebody who loves

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,200
pearl

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,799
and and i think that's probably true of

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
of everybody here

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,320
um and i've got access as well to a lot

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
of a lot of

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,000
uh recruitment data regarding the size

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,159
of the power recruitment market

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
and it pains me to say what i think we

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,640
already know

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,320
which is that the pearl programming

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,240
market is shrinking

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,920
fast and that you should probably have a

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,640
plan to deal with that if your primary

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,560
income source

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,399
is programming in perl so in this talk

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,600
i'm going to start up by backing up my

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,880
claims about the market with a little

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,560
bit of data

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,240
um i'm going to talk through what i

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,600
think your options are for responding to

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,680
this

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,439
and honestly i don't think we're going

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,560
to have any time to do the brief tour

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,280
through some of the other programming

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,479
stacks

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,960
um but maybe we will

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,880
i'd like to add as well please please

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,200
don't shoot the messenger

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,159
uh pearl is obviously not dead and and

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,160
seems to be no

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,360
no danger of dying but the number of

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,640
full-time pearl jobs

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,959
is is unambiguously in in decline at the

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,959
moment

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,120
so the first numbers here that we're

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,800
going to look at let me get rid of that

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,239
um is we're going to look at how the

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,879
market is in trouble and we're going to

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,560
start off

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,640
with some numbers from broadband

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,640
technology who are accompanied with an

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,319
extensive set of data on the wider job

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,840
market

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,920
so the following numbers take all of the

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,400
uk and u.s roles

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,680
that mention in the title any of pearl

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
python node.js

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,239
or golang and looks at how the number of

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,000
those roles for each of these compares

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,879
to the other um and sadly what you can

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,080
see here

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,879
is in 2015 10 of all

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,840
jobs mentioned pearl python node.js or

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,560
golang mentioned

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,000
pearl but by 2020 that that had fallen

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,400
to one percent

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,040
node.js grew from 20 to 25 cent at that

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,599
time

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,000
python stayed around 70 and golang

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,599
climbed from from one to five percent

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,120
in the same time period and these

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,879
numbers probably underestimate the

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,560
number of node.js jobs

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,280
as a search on that rather than

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,280
javascript

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,760
so that that's in relation to each other

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,680
but also absolute numbers

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,080
for every hundred pearl jobs that got

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,440
posted in 2015

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,720
there were 14 in 2020. now obviously

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,640
2020 was a pandemic yeah um i did a bit

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,959
of work to try and kind of

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,560
account for that but the most i could

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,560
you know realistically fudge those

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,280
numbers to account for it

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,120
we still end up with 18 jobs in 2020 for

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,040
every 100 that we had had

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,159
so either a seventh or a fifth at the

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,319
numbers that we've had in 2015.

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,560
um there's also publicly available job

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,040
numbers on

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,720
jobs.perl.org and they publish

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,239
the number of jobs that they've had

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,720
every month since since 2001. i don't

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,760
think

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,360
anybody's gonna be particularly

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,799
surprised to see that the number of jobs

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,080
posted there's been decreasing since

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,920
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,280
but really how small the numbers are now

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,000
getting

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,959
is worth sitting up and taking notice of

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,439
and

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,359
not only are the the number of jobs

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,919
shrinking but the relative rate at which

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:24,639
their shrinking is increasing to

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:27,040
a market that had 341 jobs in in 2015

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,680
can't afford to keep losing 60 jobs year

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,960
on year

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,759
and that's exactly where we find

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,960
ourselves in 2020.

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,520
um oops

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,479
while 2020 again was a pandemic here the

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,160
numbers there are just

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,840
continuation of previous trends 20 2021

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,199
is looking to be an ever so slightly

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,600
better year than 2020

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,400
which is some comfort but again we'll be

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,080
lucky

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:56,080
in 2021 to see even 30 of 2015's numbers

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,680
um and honestly the the final kind of

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,880
data point here is some

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,199
is some anecdotes from from me um

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,400
i i personally work day in and day out

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,759
with companies that hire pearl

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,680
developers

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,440
a decreasing number of our customers are

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,960
pure pearl places anymore

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,039
most are writing at least some of their

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,080
new services in node.js

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,320
python or golang the technical managers

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,080
and ctos there get heavy pressure often

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,160
from the commercial side of the business

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,919
to upgrade their stack and many of the

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,800
companies that do still have pure pearl

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,400
roles

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,479
are maintaining adding incremental

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,400
features only to old code bases

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,520
rather than starting exciting new and

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,720
greenfield

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,800
projects so given all of this

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,000
i i think it's fair to say you need to

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,080
start thinking about

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,080
about what a plan would look like

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,320
so three kind of general shapes of a

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,440
plan here the way i see it

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,960
if you want to keep working as a

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,680
programmer and you're currently all in

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,680
on perl

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,960
you've got these three options you can

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,120
stick with pearl

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,199
and hope the best you can retrain

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,039
yourself and try and get a job

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,240
using a new stack or you can find a

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,000
company that will pay you to retrain

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,400
i'm going to talk briefly about all of

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,520
these i'm going to

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,520
highlight the downsides of of

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,600
concentrating and trying to find jobs

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,280
that continue to be pure pearl

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
um i'm also going to give you some

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,080
specific strategies

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,440
on executing a move um convincing a

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,720
company to hire you as a senior

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,400
developer in a stack that you don't have

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,840
commercial experience with

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,440
and finally i'm going to try and

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,240
convince you that actually your best

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,000
option

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,280
is to get somebody to pay you to cross

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,120
train from perl

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,240
while still programming in perl

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,520
all right so let's start with the first

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,280
of these possible plans which is

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,560
sticking with pearl forever and i think

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,560
you know we all know

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,759
the world has a lot of pearl power and

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,919
valuable

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,600
money generating code bases and and

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,800
simply replacing working

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,240
battle tested code is doing a good job

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,080
it's really a pressing commercial

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,759
priority and you know it's rarely

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,560
prioritized as well against delivering

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,479
new features that pay customers want

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,240
some pure pearl jobs are basically going

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,000
to stick around forever and there will

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,400
be people who finish their careers

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,880
in 20 to 30 years time having continued

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,560
to primarily only program in pearl

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,319
continuing to nurse and just gradually

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,960
improve programs and start their life in

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,560
pearl

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
and nobody can justify the cost of

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,160
rewriting you know there

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,840
are after all still a small number of

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,800
cobol programming jobs

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,120
still out there however these may not be

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,479
the jobs you want

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,560
i've worked on a number of commercial

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,479
projects where the goal has been to

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,319
kind of keep a pearl code base alive and

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,720
take you along all the fun

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,240
and exciting uh green field work is

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,440
being done elsewhere and it can be

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,599
really disheartening

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,880
to be on a legacy life support team well

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,840
while there are people around you doing

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,000
exciting new things elsewhere in

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,599
business

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,080
and while your team and company might

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,680
currently be all in on pearl

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,599
even the most committed pearl teams can

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,199
get sideswiped by by changing

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,400
circumstances so maybe the company gets

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,840
a new cto

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,599
or maybe it gets acquired by a

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,199
competitor and the pearl

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,120
team and the code base are kind of seen

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,360
as legacy and holdouts

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,440
kept on life support and if you're very

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,240
lucky at this point they pay to retrain

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,840
you

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,319
into whatever the company's decided is

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,639
the new hotness even if that's java or c

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,319
sharp but honestly just as likely

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,039
um they end up making some of the team

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,599
redundant but listen this is still a

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,680
viable

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,120
option you know i have clients today in

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,360
the us the uk

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,039
and who hire remotely and are very

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
interested in pearl are very committed

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,919
to staying with pearl

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,680
um and don't believe they're going to

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,039
switch to anything else soon

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,800
tech and commercial leadership of these

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,479
companies are sold on pearl

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,000
and they'll most likely continue to use

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,200
pearl for their systems

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,719
indefinitely um again i

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,479
i think this is an inherently risky

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,959
choice though to to

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,560
continue down that pure pearl path um

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,640
especially as the people at the top of

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,240
companies do change through retirements

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,680
through buyouts through natural just

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,160
kind of attrition

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,760
um and you might find somebody much less

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,680
much less propel

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,000
in their place another possible

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,959
opportunity here is is retraining your

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,560
free time

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,080
i can remember is when i was a kid

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,680
learning pearl i read somebody else's

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,360
account of having sat down

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,680
and they reckoned they had read

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,760
programming pearl from front to back

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,839
and then just started churning out a

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,279
bunch of software and pearl

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,279
and if you are able to do that that's

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,399
amazing what value that i

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,839
i can't um and if you have all of the

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,760
time and the motivation to spend the

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,200
next x months using your weekends and

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,160
evenings to learn a new programming

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,120
language from scratch

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,640
again more power to you these days i

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,560
find it increasingly difficult to find

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,920
large blocks and uninterrupted time

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,680
which i can dedicate the time and

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,399
attention this would need when i don't

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,440
even have kids

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,200
or a commute however if this is you and

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,480
you can sit down and retrain yourself to

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
use a new programming language in your

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,040
free time

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,800
now would be a great time to investigate

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,839
one with more of a kind of a

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,080
buoyant job market than perl but one of

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,360
the

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,760
one of the challenges you're going to

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,760
face here is finding companies that will

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,160
hire you your current seniority without

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,560
commercial experience in their stack

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,160
um but there definitely are companies

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,120
out there who will think of a senior

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,200
developer

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,600
in almost any language as being a senior

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,760
developer regardless

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
so if you do choose a strategy what can

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,680
you do to maximize your chances of

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,959
convincing somebody to hire you

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,200
using a stack that you have no

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:24,160
commercial experience of

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,519
um so i spend a lot of time helping

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,560
people sell the skills they have

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,160
effectively

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,240
and we get a lot of great developers

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,120
come to us and send us absolutely

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,480
absolutely terrible cds um and i also

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,240
spent a lot of time helping people with

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,120
a strong back end experience in a

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,360
different stack

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,839
plus a little bit of note.js sell

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,000
themselves as node.js developers

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,519
so and so based on all of this here are

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,279
my tips

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,800
i think the key to trying to find work

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,040
in in

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
a language that you don't have

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,040
commercial experience of

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,480
um is to try and differentiate yourself

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,760
from somebody who isn't particularly

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,360
interested in the language

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,040
but just touched it once it's kind of

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,480
chancing their luck

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,000
you want to show that you are you're

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,120
invested in and committed to the new

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
language that you're trying to seek

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,399
employment in

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,720
i think one way to do this is to lean

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,240
heavily into a language's usp or all the

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,600
difficult concepts there

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,040
and prove that you've already climbed

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
that particular language's learning

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,360
curve

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,760
i think you've got a genuine interest in

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,040
the language so for example

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,200
if if somebody uh if somebody wanted to

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,160
move into pearl having strong back end

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,640
somewhere else

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,279
and you do you do still find people like

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
that

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,240
um you know we advise them that they

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,600
need to kind of lean into modern pearl

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,560
they need to get their heads

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,320
very firmly around moose and moon um

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,760
they pick up on a big web frameworks

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,040
understand plaque

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,160
um what they're trying to show here

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,680
is that they're going to be wanting to

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,480
show potential employers that they're

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,959
more than just

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,560
java developer who wrote a few fire

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,680
forget perl script ones

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,040
and this is going to be the same with

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,320
you moving into a role with new

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,519
programming languages

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,680
that you don't have commercial

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,720
experience in let's say you wanted to

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,440
move into a javascript role with node.js

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,040
your proof of interest and commitment is

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,240
going to look something like

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,519
um be you know having fully conquered

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,560
promises async await uh gaining a deep

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,399
understanding of the

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,760
like the weirdness of how function and

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,839
this works

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,839
um but again the key point here and

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,519
what's really going to help you out

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,800
is to try and show an interesting

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,079
commitment in the language sure that

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,360
you've mastered the unique selling

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,800
points and wars of that language

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,519
another great indicator that somebody

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,360
has invested and is committed that that

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,360
employers will use here is their

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,760
exposure to a stacks of auxiliary

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,040
uh tooling and so for perl this is

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,079
someone who's figured out how to get

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,240
their cpan

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,360
packages packaged up the way they want

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,399
he's played around with a few different

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,880
testing modules and can name and explain

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,399
pearl brew and local lib do if you want

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,680
to sell yourself as being invested and

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,880
committed to a language

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,800
you're going to find this much easier if

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,800
you can tell war stories about playing

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,160
around with this kind of tooling and and

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,120
one way that you're going to get that is

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,200
through your open source contributions

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,440
so many of you here will already have a

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,279
directory full of cpan modules and

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,480
the great thing about these modules is

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,240
that they represent

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,079
problems that you already know how to

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,760
solve which means they're an absolutely

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,920
great starting point for explorations

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,200
into new programming stacks

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,279
nobody's going to care if there's a

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,279
better library already on npm or

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,279
golang packages that your ported library

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,959
is just another implementation of

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,320
however the process of porting that

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,959
library packaging it

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,160
testing it documenting it and and so on

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,000
is going to expose you to many of the

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,480
pieces of auxiliary tooling

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,480
and most importantly if a potential

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,920
employer looks at your github profile

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,519
it's going to look a million times more

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,440
impressive than having forks and learn

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,360
python wrapper

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,880
so finally i'm pretty much last of all

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,959
um picking up a decent

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,800
effective x or just x design patterns

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,920
but let's see if there's anything there

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,600
you missed out

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,120
as an experienced developer in one stack

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,800
already and with a good basic

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,320
understanding of the new stack

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,000
these are going to be absolute gold

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,120
mines for you in understanding the whys

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,959
of a language

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,320
and picking up the arcana and the

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,000
shiverless needed

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,440
to confidently talk about solving

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,120
problems in that language when you're in

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,959
an interview

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,120
but i think there's a i think there is a

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,920
better strategy still here

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,639
um and this is my recommended strategy

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,040
which is getting

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,000
somebody to pay for you to crosstrain

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,279
right i'm just going to take a quick

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,320
look at the chat messages because there

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,760
are

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,760
a lot of them

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,800
fine okay um get somebody else to pay

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,680
for you to cross-train while you still

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,440
do some pearl

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,720
a good number of the pearl companies i

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,880
work with are at least

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,920
experimenting with building services in

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,839
new languages

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,199
while still having a lot of existing

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,959
perl that needs wrangling

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,360
and for many of them a move away from

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,880
pearl is a long-term strategic goal

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,480
that they don't feel any particular need

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,079
to rush towards

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,440
because they've got a functioning team

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,360
of strong pearl developers who they're

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,440
happy with

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,600
now i've seen a couple of companies go

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,079
through a process of starting off

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,839
as a pearl shop and slowly moving stuff

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,120
until they become something else and the

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,519
process generally looks

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,760
a bit like this there's some key points

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,760
here

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,880
so the team starts off experimenting

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,600
with a new language or maybe with a

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,440
couple

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,680
we can use python as an example because

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,839
i enjoy saying it

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,680
developers are you know initially in

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,600
stage one developers are given more time

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,440
to complete tickets in the new language

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,440
and the keyness of these developers are

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,079
sort of blazing away at the company

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,519
become a company python expert now note

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,240
the company is still hiring perl

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,680
developers

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,440
and perl is the main language you need

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,320
to know but the job i'll start

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,279
mentioning

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,480
an interest in python being a bonus and

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,839
after a while you kind of move on to

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,360
stage two

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,959
and you get you know maybe one or two

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,240
teams in the company writing their code

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,839
exclusively in python

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,600
maybe the company pays for training at

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,199
this point maybe they hire one or two

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,839
experts in the language

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,120
job ads make python more prominent now

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,639
this is key again

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,120
note that at this point the company is

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,199
still 100 hiring perl developers and

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,800
willing to pay pearl developers

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,399
for their experience with the view that

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,320
these pearl developers

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,079
will make the transition to python in

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,240
time

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,920
but once the die is cast once you start

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,240
to move on from there the company shifts

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,600
on to all new code being a python

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,519
most of the developers at this point

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,440
have learned some python from colleagues

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,040
or from training or just being given

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,680
extra time to complete tickets

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,160
an unfamiliar sac at some point new

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,360
hires

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,360
they won't go from being pearl

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,199
developers to to them just wanting back

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,519
end developers but whom python

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,279
starts being crucial pearls are nice to

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,199
have

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,560
and then that final stage is is the the

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,320
complete metamorphosis

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,320
and the companies then become a python

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,079
shop new hires are python

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,600
and perl skills are not especially well

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,079
regarded anymore if you don't already

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,759
know python you're out of luck

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,199
i have seen this process happen at a

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,839
number of our clients while we've worked

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,279
with them

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,120
and if i'm lucky they've moved to

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,279
node.js where i can still provide them

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,800
candidates but if i'm not

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,240
they went in a different direction and

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,000
they just no longer want pearl

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,240
candidates

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,680
the best time to join is while they're

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,680
still hiring fellow developers

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,919
the reason for this if you join a

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,199
company hiring pearl developers and you

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,319
are a pearl developer obviously you're

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,679
going to get hired at a fitting

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,679
seniority and salary

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,959
as befits your perl experience which is

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,919
probably what you want

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,919
um almost every year where you did do

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,480
mostly pearl and some python as a pearl

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,559
shop

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,160
that was becoming a python shop is a

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,520
year of commercial python experience for

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,280
your resume

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,799
a company moving from pearl to python

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,240
gradually will be looking to pay their

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,240
employees to cross-train

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,440
and maybe that's real training or maybe

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,120
that's just giving them extra time to

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,880
complete stuff

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,280
all of this time you will still be able

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,880
to write some pearl

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,480
the best time to make sure you have a

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,600
job where you can cross train on

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,600
somebody else's

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,280
dime from pearl was two to three years

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,559
ago but the second best time

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,559
is now we don't always get these nice

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,799
transitions this is an example

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,919
this here is an example of how it goes

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,080
right

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,039
however we've also got examples where it

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,120
goes wrong

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,280
and again these are things you know i

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,120
see talking to tech management

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,919
company gets acquired or there's a new

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,280
cto who is very pearl hostile and wants

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,960
something else instead

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,799
the pearl team gets made redundant um

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,960
you are obviously much better off in a

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,640
situation in a company that is slowly

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,799
transitioning from one to the other

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,840
and giving you the opportunity to cross

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,840
train at the same time

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,360
if you like where you are and you don't

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,320
want to move and they're not introducing

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,039
new languages

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,720
um it's it's worth noting in my

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,559
experience the biggest thing stopping

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,679
tech management from even suggesting

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,000
adding new languages

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,520
um can be this idea that that pearl team

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,440
will riot

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,480
um if they do i've been you know i've

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,840
talked to a couple of people at

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,080
companies like this

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,919
um this view seems to be quite widely

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,720
shared if you show some willingness to

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,240
experiment

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,559
uh you're gonna get potentially rewarded

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,039
with paid training paid days off messing

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,480
around with cool new tech

00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,720
and some significant corporate goodwill

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,480
so we've got a part three rambling about

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,360
other languages but but honestly

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,840
we move there from things i am qualified

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,640
to have an opinion oops

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,080
screen sharing has stopped we moved from

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,880
things i'm qualified to have opinion

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,080
about to just

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,280
just some thoughts so in my last minute

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,120
i'm going to have a look and see if

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,720
there's anything important there on

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,840
on chat and if you have a burning

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,120
question

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,720
throw throw something in there

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,400
and everybody should be able to unmute

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:38,000
so if they want to just ask that might

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:40,799
be the easiest

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
about five minutes before i need to end

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:46,080
um

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:50,720
peter uh i'll unmute um

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:53,760
the situation i'm in is uh we've kind of

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,559
our company architecturally is uh

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,679
kind of developed in anything but pearl

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,600
stance

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,679
uh but they haven't uh

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,840
they've still just got this grab bag of

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,080
things

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,520
um they've just pointed us at a training

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,480
site that has all these different

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,520
uh languages and things and said go and

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,520
i don't mean the language

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:22,880
so given

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,679
that you know since every

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,120
every language every architecture is its

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,640
own rabbit hole

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:34,240
um how do you choose

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,360
i think so i think for me personally

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,280
i would be looking at something that

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,200
represents more of a platform than a

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,799
given specific language and i think

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,480
really your options there are either

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,440
something based on the jvm which

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,000
certainly i know i've got

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,039
limited interest in um but then also

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,799
something based on

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,320
on on node and on browsers i think

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,919
i think you know moving into something

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,760
like python

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,159
i think python is going to have the same

00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,640
problems that pearl has in in 10 to 15

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,760
years

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,240
whereas something um

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,640
whereas i think node.js is currently

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,159
adding features and this platform part

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,039
of it and the fact as well that you've

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,320
got

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,760
a um you've got such an entrenched

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,159
market in the browsers

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,240
i think is something really powerful i'd

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,039
also point out that if you can stomach

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,640
it

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:26,080
golang is is a really useful accessory

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,520
skill there i i hate golang but um

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,760
that doesn't mean it's a bad from a

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,520
career perspective one thing you'll note

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,600
about a lot of golang jobs

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,799
is that golang is an ad in language

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,200
there and that they're looking for

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,840
developers in another back end

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,880
and yet they will write some uh they'll

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,480
write some stuff

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:47,280
in golang there um and i think

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,159
with a you know with a a set of jobs

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,840
like that

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,840
you having strong golang skills is going

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,120
to allow you to jump between them

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,880
um personally i spent the last six weeks

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,280
teaching myself node.js and i've been

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,240
having the most incredible amount of fun

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,400
um with async await with promises with

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,039
generators with streams

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,840
i can also tell you that the market rate

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,799
for

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,640
node.js developers in london is 20 30

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,760
000 pounds higher than it is for senior

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,840
pearl developers

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,159
at the moment um i don't know about

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,960
numbers outside of london but i suspect

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,080
that's pretty

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,080
pretty addictive there

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,520
what's your opinion on rust i love the

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,440
idea of it

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,120
i'm not sure in terms of what i would

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,799
use it for i don't know

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,080
something about rust seems very pearlish

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,039
to me i don't know if anybody else kind

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,480
of feels

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,919
feels that way about it it's a big

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,679
language that does a lot of exciting

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,320
stuff and it seems to have these kind of

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,720
these functional feelings um however i

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,240
can't

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
yeah that's just personal preference i

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,760
can't give you any market market

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,000
feelings on rust

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,960
i i'll i'll i've been writing rest for

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,400
fun uh

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,559
i've looked at the breast job market

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,320
it's pretty small and

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,080
a disturbingly large amount of it is

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,360
cryptocurrency companies

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,720
um i think it will grow over the next

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,679
five or ten years but right now it's

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,960
quite a bit smaller

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,039
i would agree with what you were saying

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,520
peter no go

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:14,640
those are like bigger and growing

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,640
than rust at the moment

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,520
yeah i mean i i've honestly enjoyed node

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,200
much

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,880
much more than i thought i would having

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,400
having the ability to drop into

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,400
typescript when you have a bit of code

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,760
that you want um the safety of typings

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,240
with has been great

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,840
again the async stuff has been has been

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,039
great fun now i've done quite a bit

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,320
of async stuff in perl before

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:42,240
uh with mojo but uh also there's there's

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,240
a mojo there's a mojo port

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,679
to to node upcoming so i'm pretty

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,880
bullish on i think i think that's

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,480
probably coming through

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,320
yeah dave you had a

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,520
yeah you're your former role you all

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,720
started introducing

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,200
uh stuff written and go right yeah yeah

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,480
then my last employer we started off on

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,520
pearl and then we started

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,520
go my current employer

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,159
i've i've written pearl just for like

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,720
one-off scripts all our services

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,559
are in go um basically we're using go

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,320
python and then elm on the front end

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,919
which is a

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,840
it's like haskell for the web that

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,840
compiles to javascript

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,559
all right any more for any more

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,600
any good recommendations that you toss

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,640
in for anyone looking into

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,640
node.js for example

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,960
um i honestly i think i think going to

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,960
your own cpan directory if you have one

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,440
and just trying to port stuff over is

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,559
is a great idea i've been enjoying

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,159
reading through node.js design patterns

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,240
but honestly this is this is something

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,120
i've something that i do and i don't

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,720
know if other people

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,720
how much other people would enjoy doing

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,480
it it's just trying to figure out how

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,360
stuff works especially if you've done

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:04,240
some javascript before

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,240
looking at the new es6 features there

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,320
i had this base assumption that almost

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,720
all developers know some

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,640
javascript and i think yeah i found the

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,279
node.js design patterns book

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,520
to starts off talking about what what

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,279
node is in terms of it being a wrapper

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,799
around um

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:26,000
an event library um and

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,480
multiplexing uh events and so on um so

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,840
yeah

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,840
heavy recommendation for that book

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,440
okay well thank you for speaking peter

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,679
as to as to brett here uh russ and go

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,760
support real concurrency

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,840
i believe node.js is just single

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,520
threaded um

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,200
i believe it's single threaded but you

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,919
can use a technology called

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,720
workers um to kind of to spread stuff

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,000
out there

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,159
that's not something i know that much

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,559
about cool yeah thank you i

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,200
was obviously something i'm interested

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,520
in but

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,880
i haven't really played with node.js

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,480
much but

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,720
i have i've looked into go more than

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,279
rust but i do know that

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,279
they're pretty powerful for

00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:11,279
