Description: 
	Standard ANSI Escape codes have been around a long time for representing colors (as well as several other lesser attributes). Their definition has remained obtuse (obscene even?) for far too long. Let's change that. Learn d8-bow (ROYGCBMP) with blacK && White ends. Zero to reset && 21 is good-to-go!

Pip's Octology (on GitHub) shows how to export Bash and Zsh environment variables, which mainly emphasize 21 escape values which gr8ly simplify command-line coloriz8ion. The a8.pm Perl-Module does something very similar for any Perl code which uses it. The result is a minimalist approach to mnemonic and growing comprehension of how to colorize almost any text (almost anywhere in a terminal) quickly, easily, uniformly, and memorably. Please learn these 21 and go cast your Perls-B4-Hogs-Wild coloring whatever you find. Learn from `S` and `c` which gener8 much more than just 20 basic Fore-ground color codes. `tsgr` will add Select-Graphic-Rendition capabilities to your Perl tool-chest (well endowed?  ;P  ). Follow Pip and Octology if you want to bask in gr8r living color ahead, please.
