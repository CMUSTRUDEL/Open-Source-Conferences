at the end

00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,840
[Music]

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,160
so a little bit about the pearl

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,800
foundation for those who don't know

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,440
the official name is yet another society

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,920
we're

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,719
registered in north america operated

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,520
globally

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,120
by uh volunteers i'm in the uk uh

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,719
majority of the

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,719
board are from uh north america

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,199
and pearl foundation the pole down

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,559
foundation is our doing business as

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,600
name and we also are now also doing

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,799
business as

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,840
the raiku foundation the purpose of the

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,119
pearl foundation

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,280
is purely to serve the pearl and raku

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,520
communities there's no other purpose the

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,759
pearl foundation wouldn't have

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,880
um without pearl without raku there'd be

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,920
no purpose for the

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,560
pearl foundation so that's our number

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,560
one purpose

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,400
traditionally we've been the bank

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,320
manager uh managing the grants and uh

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,439
sponsorships and supporting

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,439
uh conferences and so on around

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,479
also uh governance some of the legal

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,840
aspects uh

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,079
intellectual property we'll talk about

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,560
that shortly and

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,320
organisational support effectively doing

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,560
the things that are not interesting

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,600
to the technical people uh who are

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,600
involved in parliament

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,439
what we're trying to do most importantly

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,600
improve

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,560
perception of pearl that is uh top of

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,799
the list

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,079
um i think pearl's had a an unfair

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,759
time over a year the last uh many years

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,080
for all sorts of reasons

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,920
um so we need to work hard to improve

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,599
the perception of perl

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,879
and help people look past some of the

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,800
surface challenges and actually get

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,800
involved with the technology

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,239
so branded advocacy is part of that

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,840
marketing is another word for it

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,319
sponsors are critical to funding

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,200
key activities that the grants are of

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,920
course funded by

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,599
sponsors so we're looking to retain and

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,599
develop new sponsors

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,040
we support the community affairs team

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,920
and the the

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,000
mission there is to improve the um some

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,640
of the quality we've we've got a

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,040
tough uh balance of strike there which i

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,120
think

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,400
we know about and again we can judge on

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,840
that later

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,599
we heard earlier talk about uh jobs

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,879
there's clearly a job shortage i know

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,800
where my organization has

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,640
sought developers who struggle to find

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,400
them um but there's both

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,800
pearls skills and a jobs shortage

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,000
we need to work out we can better engage

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,760
with the uk

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,200
and europe so that there's been

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,599
conversations around

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,959
uh developing european conferences so

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,879
pearl foundation need to

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,800
work out how we can best support those

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,519
there's complexities around legalities

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,080
bank accounts that kind of thing

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,599
developing tools and infrastructure uh

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
making sure that uh the

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,200
various groups and communities have the

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,200
things they need to get on with what

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,560
they want to get on with without getting

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,799
tripping over challenges with

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,680
infrastructure we need to be showcasing

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,640
pearl and

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,000
raku applications that's important

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,040
because

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,400
to most people pearl and raku themselves

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,560
don't matter that the

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,440
the people are engaging higher up the

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,640
stack

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,959
so we need to work out how we can

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,280
showcase the things that pearl and raku

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,400
enable as well as to the developer

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,519
community

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,560
what you can enable using perl and riku

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,280
community connections is important when

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,480
i first

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,840
became involved it was i i

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,599
it was very difficult for me to find

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,599
anyone who could tell me where

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,720
i would find all of the various

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,840
communities i

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,720
i think it's it's largely unmapped um

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,280
and as time goes on one finds more sets

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,560
of people

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,160
doing uh something in in isolation and

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,680
it's it's important to have some level

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,320
of connection

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,360
um as well between the communities your

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,560
ideas are welcome

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,479
pearl foundation is is keen to hear what

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,120
what people want what people think and

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,120
what we can do

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,639
so uh the boards um i mentioned the the

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,840
team that we have uh they're on camera

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,639
but i think maybe when we get to the

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,160
panel

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,639
the guys can introduce themselves it's

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,040
probably easier to do to that point

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,759
uh there's nine board members currently

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,800
and

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,000
the the list is on the website and when

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,160
the slides are shared you'll be able to

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,720
click on the links to get there as well

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,199
board members have a two term and the

00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,680
board

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,280
the other members will ask whoever's at

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,840
their term what they want to do

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,520
for the coming period uh to make sure

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,840
we're focused and we have a purpose to

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,479
our

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,240
roles here we've been meeting every at

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,840
least every month for the last

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,880
18 months or so and when there's events

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,120
and other things going on

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,720
we're meeting more often we have

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,440
administration support by

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,280
nick evans um so you may see blogs

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,160
posted by nick evans on behalf of the

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,840
board

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,680
it's worth saying that she is the only

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,800
non-volunteer so she's paid for her role

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,880
as an administrator

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,720
and she also has marketing experience so

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,840
she's taking care of some of the

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,320
activities why that works well is

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,479
because

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,840
as a non-volunteer we can hold her

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,080
accountable we can

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,960
ask her to to deliver things on certain

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,880
days

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,120
um and that happens she's very good at

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,120
that

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,080
i'd like to just put security on the

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,280
agenda almost every talk i do

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,720
i'll find some angle on security

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,639
supply chain attacks specifically um

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,560
for us is something we need to be aware

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,319
of we've had the pill.com

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,199
issue not too long ago there's been

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,880
other issues as well

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,960
around cpan and in the background but

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,880
actually some of the recent

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,680
items i've listed here from some of the

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,960
other main languages php ruby pi

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,160
mpn have all suffered from recent

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,520
attacks on either through the uh

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,319
the libraries or in into the cause so we

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,240
we all need to be aware of that it would

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,759
that the risks are out there we need to

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,520
not underestimate them

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,880
and we just need to be prepared we need

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,319
it in our minds when we're doing things

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,319
how we mitigate those risks

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,520
board appointments so the historically

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,479
board members have been selected by the

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,160
current board

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,759
and the president is normally selected

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,960
from that group of people there's been a

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,639
few exceptions

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,080
as to that i'm one of those i wasn't on

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,599
the board prior to

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,720
having the role um we will be inviting

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,440
new board members there's been debate

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,199
around

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,440
membership and democracy and how that

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,080
might work yet another society

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,919
is not a membership organization we can

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,440
debate the technicalities of that but

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,400
the mechanics aren't there for a simple

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,160
vote of members

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,560
because we don't have a list of members

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,120
who can vote

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,560
i i'm not suggesting that there's never

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,360
a conversation in future to have that

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,240
i'm saying as

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,840
it sits today that's not how the design

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,680
that's not the design of the current

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,800
organization

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,199
and formal elections have a level of

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,400
rigor that are needed so if there are

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,240
going to be some kind of elections we

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,199
need to be thinking that through

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,000
thoroughly uh there is there has been a

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,400
proposal

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,199
for community nominations which then the

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,280
board can

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,319
will consider and that's something that

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,440
we're discussing

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,840
as a board currently um so there's a

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,919
proposal written previously on the

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,520
pearl foundation blog and again you when

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,720
the slides are you can either search for

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,400
that or when the slides come out you can

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,240
click on the link there

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,840
and you'll be able to go to that and

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,440
that may well be a way that we can

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,520
enable uh community to to propose people

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,280
and what what pearl foundation board

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,360
will do is put an outline brief and

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,479
criteria

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,319
because taking the role of a

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,240
board member has a certain amount of

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,319
liability attached to it

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,440
and also we need to consider what kind

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,280
of skills

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,639
do we think will be most valuable to the

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,639
pearl foundation going forward

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,080
values transparency transparency isn't

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,279
important to us

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,039
we've had uh criticism about being a

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,880
lack of transparency but but i think

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,279
that a lot of the

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,399
the questions around transparency are

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,919
when there's

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,839
nothing there when there's a void when

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,040
there's a a hole in the

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,320
dialogue it's not because someone's

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,519
doing something behind the scenes they

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,600
don't want people to see it

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,519
to see it's because maybe that's not

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,440
something we've been talking about

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,360
we've been sharing the meeting notes

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,279
since april 2020

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,680
we have our monthly community meetings

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,560
and those are very open

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,720
um we talk about whatever people need to

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,320
talk about

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,440
the board is active deliberate and

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,480
considered because of this

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,880
responsibility

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,480
so just like if somebody's in the

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,200
technical community you have

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,720
a responsibility for all sorts of

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,040
aspects of the technology

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,120
the pearl foundation have legal and

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,920
financial responsibility

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,560
as well and listening and supporting the

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,000
communities

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,680
is also really important to us well it's

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,920
critical that's like i say where we

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,200
exist

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,399
pearl foundation are operating

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,720
various projects or supporting projects

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,760
uh directly so we've heard about some of

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,040
the uh

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,640
great work that people are doing around

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,160
summer of code season of dogs and so the

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,480
pearl foundation are trying to support

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,640
people to to make these things happen

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,399
uh there's various conversations about

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,399
chat systems which again

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,560
something that pearl foundation through

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,839
the community meetings as well are

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,800
discussing

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,160
uh recognized resources is a project to

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,760
highlight and showcase

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,399
various aspects of the communities the

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,640
people the resources which are

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,920
uh are of a level of quality and

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,519
professionalism

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,519
um to try and allow people who are

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,120
coming into our network to to go and

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,920
look and identify where these

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,920
where these are we have a uh we've

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,079
received a proposal for a contributor

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,560
research project from anvikan which we

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,760
should be undertaking in the coming year

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,519
um and that will will be uh

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,000
that will be a set of interviews where

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,440
anne would like to with her researchers

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,360
uh interview various members of the

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,959
community and get an understanding of

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,519
how

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:44,079
contributors work compliance

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,279
is another project we have not getting

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,600
the level of

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,200
progress that i'd like but whether it is

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,360
there in the background

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,640
um there's things like open innovation

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,600
network open source initiative

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,839
engagements

and we're also i mentioned earlier about

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,240
the board we're also consistently

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,120
looking at

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,839
what we can do as a board to change and

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,839
improve as well

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,519
uh community representatives meeting so

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,880

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,079
is where where people will come along

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,320
with an idea

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,240
uh with some of the conversations around

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,240
the recent surveys have come from the

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,600
uh community meetings where the the

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,680
initiative is to say well how can we

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,800
um new people and and there's a there's

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,000
a group of

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,000
maybe 10 15 20 people depending on

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,360
which meeting where where we get to

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,440

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,560
people think it's a

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,560
good idea and of course getting to know

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,160
each other it's it's another community

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,600
of people and it helps the more people

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,480
know each other the faster people can

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,720
move

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,880
um and if anyone is interested in

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,240
representing a community and you're not

um the various channels or emails and i

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,079
think the email addresses are

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,480
most likely on the website you can

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:20,959
always email hello at

that we've got everything covered there

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,320
may well be communities

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,279
uh who are out there who are not covered

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,440

we have

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,240
regular engagement with uh so we have

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,800
legal and commercial for example

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,839
um where we've uh looked at contracts

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,360

came through um discussions around

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,480
grants

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,839
and we talked about infrastructures

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,279
there's all sorts of conversations

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,279
around that and it helps everyone know

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:09,440
what everyone else is doing as well

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,920
help needed a volunteer coordinator will

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,600
be useful someone who's interested in

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,120
helping making sure that the people who

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,279

volunteers that we neglect uh marketing

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,519
is

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,440
is uh is an interesting one so uh mark

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,720
mark keating who has been responsible

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,320
for marketing for a while

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,880
uh has had various challenges in the

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,839
last year um so he's now

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,839
um we now have uh the lead role in the

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,480
marketing delegated temporarily

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,680
to dean though there is lots of things

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
we could be doing in marketing and

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,519
promoting

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,399
um we definitely need to be all working

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,880
together to promote

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,240
pearl and raccoon so if you've got ideas

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,839
you've got thoughts around that then

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,839
then please get involved and

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:59,199

conference supports tprc 2022 so

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,800
next year all being well depending on

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,399
how conditions go but it's

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,000
likely it's very likely in it and the

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,160
intent is to have a

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,440
a physical meeting in houston that's the

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,920
plan

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,800
so unless anything goes badly wrong with

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,240
the

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,320
general global condition at the minute

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,320

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,120
everything

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,320
put in place as soon as possible so

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,519
please support todd

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,839
with that um sponsor nominations if you

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,680
know an organisation

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,560
who who benefits from pearl and they're

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,240
not sponsoring

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,560
then maybe you can suggest that to our

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,639
sponsorship team or bring it to the

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,639
community meeting as well

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,639
so the questions that we have what what

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,399
do you as the communities want from the

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,920
pearl foundation um why pearl what made

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,440
you start with pearl that the

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,880
reason that's an important question and

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,000
i've asked people i've met i've asked

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,920
this question

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,279
because whatever made you start with

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,519
pearl

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,120
that message someone else might resonate

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,720
and it might make them realize why they

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,320
need to start with pearl as well so we

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,440
do need to be sharing the message

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,839
what made you start with pearl

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,440
if you have thoughts on what the most

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,279
important one thing is that

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,199
pearl and raccoon need then share those

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,279
thoughts

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,320
i've asked for one thing because we can

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,360
all think of

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,800
50 things but if we can pick one thing

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,480
if you can suggest one item that you

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,320
think is most important

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,920
then that's a lot more actionable we can

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,279
we can see what we can do with that

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,040
uh interested to hear what people's

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,880
visions are for pearl and raccoon

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,560
and that might be technology it might be

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,279
framework it might be future you might

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,680
be thinking

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,600
in 100 years time what's going to be

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,360
what's raccoon powering

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,880
what is pearl is pearl still the the

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,839
glue of the internet or whatever that

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,120
might be

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,519
next um and what are your questions so

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,880
uh there may there's some i look at the

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,320
chat in a sec

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,560
but what i'll do now is i'll stop the

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,399
screen share and

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,839
if you you can ping questions you can

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:36,399
raise your hands

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:40,320
and let's hear from from you

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:43,680
right so let's see let's start off with

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,480
uh will you have your hand up yes thank

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,600
you you said

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,000
one thing that's going to be tough but

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,759
i guess since it's not my one thing i'll

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,680
just mention that the cat team

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,600
still seems to be making things worse

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,360
instead of better pearl seven still

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,240
seems to be somewhat of a mysterious

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,880
mess

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,720
and uh i think we really need raku to

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,799
have its own foundation

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,079
and programs that are not taking our

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,839
time and money but those aren't the

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,039
things that i think the number one most

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,480
important thing which you actually did

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,799
touch on

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,839
is the essentially complete lack of

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,240
democracy

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,000
um for for the pro foundation really for

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,400
the pro core team as well both you and

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,799
ricardo in today in your slides

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,799
actually said explicitly that your

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,959
groups elect themselves

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,360
your governing group the board elects

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,000
itself of tpf and his core group elects

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,720
itself

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,559
for the technical stuff and last i

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,880
checked self-elected governing bodies

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,600
are

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,320
not exactly what we want in a democratic

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,799
society

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,400
so i i understand that there is no

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,160
official membership for people in the

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,280
pro foundation that is clearly going to

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,640
have to change

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,320
you're going to have to make some way

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,240
for people to buy an annual membership

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,360
and get a dues card and get a vote

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,160
and you're going to have to stop

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,400
electing yourselves it's it's not good

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,280
and

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,280
and i have visited a lot with you about

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,000
things and a lot with your predecessors

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,000
about things

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,760
and i got to tell you that the pro

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,160
foundation could be doing a lot better

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,160
job

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,080
i'm not going to say i hate you guys but

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,679
i'm not really very impressed

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,679
either but i'm going to be here year

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,039
after year to try and give some

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,280
constructive feedback

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,559
there's got to be a way not just to

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,520
nominate people

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,320
but to actually have the whole board

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,600
voted on

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,960
by the pearl community not by yourselves

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,280
thank you i appreciate your your energy

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,120
and

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,440
we're all aligned that we we need to be

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,960
positive and we need to improve

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,120
um no question that's really important

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,640
as far as how we do it it's not going to

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,000
be as easy as flicking a switch

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,360
to change into the democracy

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,200
that is thought there but we do need to

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,120
work out how we go on that journey

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,280
so let's do that together let's work out

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,400
whether what the destination needs to be

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,000
and how we're going to get there

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,440
now we're not going to solve that today

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,640
but again you know we can we need to

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,640
continue those conversations

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:11,840
uh other questions any other questions

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,360
keen to hear people's thoughts visions

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,840
what what capel foundation can do for

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,280
you

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,640
um thoughts of your visions for the

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,080
future

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,240
so uh can i i'd like to

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,000
chip in a thought uh for your

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,520
consideration

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
um i've as i've been

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,880
involved in some internet related

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,080
organizations

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,679
a few years now um one called the

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,039
internet society

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:52,160
and others and in those communities

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:55,280
there they have their way

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,440
of engaging with their

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,400
communities their sub-communities that

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,520
are in

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:06,960
practice global and very heterogeneous

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,039
they take a look at

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,400
solving their interaction and their

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,840
democratic

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,640
deficit so to speak by

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,840
talking about and using this concept of

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,120
stakeholder

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,159
communities

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,600
is that concept the stakeholder

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,559
community is something

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,200
you guys in the bird foundation have

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,280
talked about

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,400
and considered as something that could

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,840
perhaps work

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,960
in our situation

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,600
i will ask my colleagues there

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,880
who have been with the pearl foundation

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,320
longer than i

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,320
for their thoughts on that

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:54,000
i've never heard that term could you

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,520
give a definition well

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,840
when it comes to say for example for

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,960
icann i don't know if you know that

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,080
organization

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,280
sure yeah um

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,960
it's a series of communities

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,000
uh of people who have um the cons

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,720
consisting of people who have common

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,880
interests

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:19,360
or or in the greater picture of

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,120
the greater community so for example in

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,360
icann's

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,360
case which is like all about the domain

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,559
names the domain system systems and

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,880
uh and how to organize that it's we we

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,960
have

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,320
governments we have the technical

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,480
community we have

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:39,600
uh the private sector the

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,400
civil society and a bunch of others now

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,679
this doesn't freely transfer over to the

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,880
prayer community

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,960
but we as far as i

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,880
see it we do have stakeholder

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,240
communities if we think about it for

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,640
example

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,400
the academic community they have a

00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,000
certain type of problems

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,120
that are coming across their

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,120
that constituency

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,600
and their voice would be interesting to

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,520
hear when it comes to those topics and

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,240
and they have priorities that are worth

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,200
listening to

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,880
and the same would go for businesses and

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,520
the same would go for

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,760
uh community organizers and the same

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,039
would go for

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,840
the pearl five porters like steering

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,360
committee or

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:30,159
the great the core team or whatever or

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,919
or the sysadmin community like the you

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,000
could pick and choose

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:38,640
anybody who claims to be a stakeholder

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,760
if they could gather enough people with

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,960
the same

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,640
ideas and opinions they might be worth

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,919
listening to and

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,520
having them a way to organize

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:55,120
those voices i think would be very good

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:58,480
to get coherent and and

00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,440
like a wide set of opinions from

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,760
everybody who cares about this community

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,840
and

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:08,480
both at large but also in specific ways

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,039
yeah that makes sense um actually i will

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,960
say we're

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,720
sort of doing some of that so when

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,120
stewart was talking about the community

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,760
meetings we've been having we have had

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,520
it's kind of a mix of two things we have

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,200
kind of representatives from communities

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,640
for example from the racco core team

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,240
pearl core team

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,080
uh and talk about the things they're

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,960
doing and then the other part of it is

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,280
like

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,640
volunteer committees and tpf so like the

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,559
grants committee

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,480
uh infrastructure working group

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:38,000
community affairs team and so on

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,679
um so i think you know i and i looked

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,600
and i googled and i found something i

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,120
think that might be relevant for icann

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,640
it looks like for them it's more it's

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,960
also part of their bylaws so it's like a

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,320
more

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,120
formal thing um it is

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,400
but yeah i think what you're saying

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,760
makes a lot of sense and if there are

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,200
other kind of communities we can

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,520
identify that there's yeah

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,880
there's a group of people who feel that

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,000
they have a common interest related to

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,360
pearl and raku

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,880
and want to participate in these

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,320
discussions i think that would be

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,360
fantastic

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,240
yeah and the i can community even makes

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,120
sure to help

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,760
organize each of those stakeholder

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,320
communities in such a way that

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,159
they if i understand it correctly they

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,799
elect representatives

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,919
to uh like a steering wheel something

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,679
like that

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:27,919
as an advisory committee for the board

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,799
in such a way that there's a like a

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,760
consistent

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,880
voice from each of those communities

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,360
available for

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,520
for the board and the other people make

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,520
stuff happen

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,600
yeah i think that's that's a model that

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,799
i've seen in other places where you have

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:48,000
an operational board and you have a

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:50,000
and a separate organization for

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,520
overall governance and normally the

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,760
separate organization

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,960
may be community voted in and they hold

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,440
the board to account who

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,760
operate the the day-to-day so there are

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,080
various models we can look at

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,120
and again thinking long term right now

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,559
we need to think about what are the

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,960
things we need to do

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,559
in the short medium term but actually

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,000
medium and long term

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,840
we do need to look at those models and

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,600
work out what is best for for the

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,960
community

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,960
if the if there is uh interest

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,640
in helping develop some ideas around

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,080
this then

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,679
that's the kind of activity you could

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,200
bring to the community leaders

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:30,159
uh community uh representatives meeting

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,840
um and we can start discussing it and

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,440
see where we can take it

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,440
that's the forum to to bring that

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,000
up yeah brilliant well um get involved

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
there's a slack channel if you've uh

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,120
slack is a bit of a pain as far as if

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,400
you're a single channel

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,080
guest it's harder to get you on there

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
but if you're not then we can get you in

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,640
uh

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,279
invited to that channel if you ping me

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,720
we'll get that sorted out yeah

00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,320
all right excellent um okay so there's a

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,760
message in the chat

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,960
for uh from tuck's uh end

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:10,400
user graphical applications so

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,320
i'm interested to uh to hear a bit more

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,320
about that

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:20,640
um john monster is a well-known

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:24,000
person that said it needed it and i

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,600
agree applications

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,840
and diffuse written in python are

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,480
uh common used and well appreciated and

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,760
we have

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,279
no applications in perl whatsoever that

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,679
give that same user experience and

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,600
when we discuss something like that it's

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,640
always yes i use tk

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,039
or wx or prima or whatever to

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,279
create something but everything that is

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,720
created is created for the person

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:58,000
themselves i'm

00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,720
i'm to blame uh my two i

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,120
all only write applications for myself

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,080
but

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,000
what the community is missing is real

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,600
applications that are

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,600
in use and useful

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,440
so there's uh of recent times there's

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,320
been a

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,039
significant migration to web as a

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,880
desktop

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,279
and more and more applications find

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,200
themselves in a web browser

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,679
um so there's there's a there's a lot of

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,360
um movement that way i'm

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,600
myself personally i'm not a fan of that

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,039
i much prefer proper integrated

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,760
applications um so i guess one

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,480
one could consider whether the right

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,679
approach is

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,679
is a web based framework to create web

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,880
applications or whether actually you're

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,760
considering more of an integrated

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,880
desktop

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,559
gtk type i prefer the letter

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,440
yeah okay a real

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,880
gui designer that works as well on

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,000
windows as mac os

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,760
as linux and is not depending on tk

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,919
which is is it's it's fine but it's

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:09,440
looking ancient uh and well supported

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:12,799
by wx has died in my

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,799
uh opinion

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,600
and there's a point there electron yes

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:21,279
well that's a great example of

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,799
wrapping web apps into a desktop app um

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:28,080
electron is slow and it's been

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,799
it's a devil to your system resources

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,799
yeah i think as far as this sort of

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:36,240
technical stuff goes

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:39,200
this isn't really tpf's

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,640
role i mean our role there mostly is to

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,080
fund the grants committee

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,320
um we're not

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,480
i think i think technical initiatives

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,159
need to start outside tbf

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,200
um tpf is here to do the grunt work that

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,960
no

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,159
uh person in the right way wants to do

00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,480
like incorporate as a 501c3 so we can

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,600
get insurance for a conference and

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,279
things like that

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,039
um now that i'm saying this is a bad

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,799
idea it's just i feel like you're maybe

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,559
not bringing into the exact right place

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,679
to get an action on

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,399
so yeah and i think my

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,720
point there is yes agree with everything

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,440
uh

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,159
dave said my point there is that what if

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,240
if that

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,360
is something that is needed and has

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,640
traction what

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,039
what needs to happen to make it uh

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,640
make it real and we i mentioned in the

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,960
presentation earlier about applications

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,919
things that people get to use

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,600
uh through perl rather than perl itself

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,000
maybe a grant application is the way to

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,480
go

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,080
if if you or somebody has an idea as to

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,000
how that might be

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:48,960
um then that might be a good place to go

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,960
for that other questions

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,600
so there was a some comments in the

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,480
chats

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,440
around um pearl and the the debate about

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,480
how

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,840
um popular pearl is or

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,919
there are teams that are looking to

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,039
remove pearl and of course the talk from

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,200
peter earlier

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,240
was uh focusing on some of those

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,559
challenges

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,000
um from my experience from the from the

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,200
people i've talked to

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,360
the their pearl has received a bad

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,760
reputation for all sorts of reasons but

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,760
often it's because maybe a manager

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,840
thinks the technology doesn't work

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,240
and it's pearl's fault i think in almost

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,399
every case that i've been involved with

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,000
it's always been a business problem not

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,960
a pearl problem and you can make

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,520
something not work in any language

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,159
so i i would suggest that when people

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,840
find those

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,600
type of challenges that that one

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,039
considers is actually

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,559
is it a problem with pearl is it a

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,679
shortcoming of the pearl technology or

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,679
is it actually a

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,200
a problem that someone started writing

00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,320
this code 20 years ago without a

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,080
business plan

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,000
the business is now successful the

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,279
code's a mess

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,799
and maybe it's not pearl's fault and

00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,559
actually maybe a migration needs to be

00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,360
modernizing of the pearl rather than

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,679
moving to a

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,960
different language so i think that's one

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,080
of the challenges

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,679
pearl has has had over the years

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,760
and i think there's lots of benefits

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:14,720
from putting together a business case

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,080
for how one could re-implement using a

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,279
new way of doing perl

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,519
which will always be better than

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,960
re-implementing in most cases depending

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,279
on if there's technical features that

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,880
are

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,799
not provided which is a different

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,559
situation but if it's simply that the

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,200
code is is a mess no one wants to touch

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,519
it it might

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,799
be that using the same people to

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,080
re-implement in a different way could

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,240
well be uh

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,080
an answer so i'm interested in other

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,640
people's opinions on that other thoughts

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,200
is that

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,399
does that do other people share those

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,600
thoughts

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,600
do they have different experiences

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,000
or maybe no one's had any experience of

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,399
pearl projects being uh

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,399
canned

00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:02,240
i think um one of the main reasons is

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:05,679
expensive to use is that

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,880
sdks aren't being delivered

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,880
by service providers

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,799
okay so sdks what kind of sdks

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:27,279
uh well think of um amazon aws

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:30,320
uh they didn't provide a pull sdk

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:33,440
um there's an open source one

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,720
which has been put together but it's not

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:40,320
actively maintained by amazon and so

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,360
it's expensive for people to use it

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,840
okay so that's maybe an example of

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,919
of a grant if something if there were

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,039
someone who would be willing to

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,360
develop such a uh an sdk then maybe a

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,039
grant would be appropriate to fund that

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,320
uh if that then helps people integrate

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,720
with it but you're absolutely right if

00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,760
if

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,799
a new user wants to a new developer

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,039
wants to access the

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,480
amazon features then they will go

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,159
somewhere where there's already an sdk

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,360
they certainly won't

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,320
build it from scratch i think that i

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,200
think what needs to happen in those

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,080
situations is

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,360
is somebody would propose that they

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,440
think that's a good idea

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,440
and and a grant might help them make it

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,720
real

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,640
um i also work with the company that

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,320
just do a lot of uh

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:39,840
things in the in pro uh but but

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,840
pro is being pushed out by here by java

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,799
as i can see there are there are two

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,720
major problems first of all

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,120
there just aren't enough people willing

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,080
to program and grow

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,519
um if you have two a half thousand

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,840
developers

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,080
there are not enough people in the world

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,440
anymore that want to

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,360
um both move to amsterdam and work in

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,640
pro

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,679
and secondly

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:13,599
perl just doesn't work very well

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:17,520
on on big surface um

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,839
we now have have served lots of lots of

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,159
of course

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:24,720
um and and cpus

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,280
if people write something in java they

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,359
can use the full potential of a server

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,040
if you write the same thing in pro you

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,079
get one cpu

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,839
i think perl has missed the boat

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,839
a few years ago um

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:44,480
yeah there's there's no way back

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,720
uh as as i can see it the three main

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,119
platforms nowadays are mobile

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,639
pro doesn't turn there the browser drill

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,760
doesn't run there

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,879
and large surface and pro just performs

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,880
poorly there and i think those are

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,320
are are the main issues i think those

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,000
are the main reasons why

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:08,160
world is losing ground and i don't see

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,160
any way to turn that tight

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,359
okay and yeah it may well be that it's

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,599
not appropriate for those

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,400
key areas i understand there was a web

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,960
assembly

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,400
or there is a web assembly uh project

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,000
i'm not very familiar with that

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,320
in in perl um i understand raku is

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,599
designed to take advantage of the

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:30,720
multiple processors

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,720
of course pearl isn't

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,040
why if you want to move away from

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,440
folklore why move to raku

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,960
where there are hardly any more

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,440
programmers than their pool

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,000
instead of java where you can choose up

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,200
to a million

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,800
programs yeah

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,240
indeed and i guess that every

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,640
environment is different if what you

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,560
have

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,760
is perl programmers and you have a

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,599
business that those programmers

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,480
understand

00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,200
then in that situation there may be

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,240
benefits

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,680
it depends on the business and the

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,119
project objectives but there may be

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,480
benefits of doing it

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,560
there will be different situations and

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,000
we can generalize um

00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,079
but i think what we need to be focusing

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,240
on is where are those

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,079
opportunities for pearl where where

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,040
where is it going to work best

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,040
what does it need to do

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,520
may i yes that's one thing

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,359
until now if i you all talked about you

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,839
know

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,960
business opportunities or business areas

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,280
et cetera

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,760
um i think we pretty much established

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,000
that there as ambiance said there are

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,440
many areas where valley is deficient i

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
might say or perhaps

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,040
it hasn't been able to to make strides

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,079
into

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,280
um i do also believe there is a problem

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,440
with the opposite side

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,760
i mean on you might see on the

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,000
grassroots level

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,440
by which i mean that there is quite a

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,839
difficulty to generate

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,599
enthusiasm about the language about this

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:03,440
feature et cetera in

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:07,280
you know because of how they put it

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,000
you know sort of amatorial developers

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,800
and you know

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,160
enthusiasts in general there are quite a

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,320
lot that

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,200
you know have been into for many many

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,000
years

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,839
sometimes decades and there it just

00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,599
doesn't seem at least to me

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:26,720
to be matching on the technical level

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,440
in the language that makes it look as

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,880
something

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,920
desirable or you know innovative for

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,320
for you for new programmers etc a few of

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,560
them

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,680
many of them actually don't don't even

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,760
know about uh

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,320
which is something i feel strange about

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,240
but perhaps to them is something

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,440
on the likes of cobalt or something like

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,240
that it's just

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,640
just more common on a machine but they

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,680
just

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,640
don't get any anywhere close to it so if

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,520
we talk about

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,720
investments and which is something i

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,760
believe the

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,240
um the tpf is more involved in

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,880
so rather than the the technical side of

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,160
it

00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,240
i guess that is sort of a

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,160
i don't know how to quote it it's there

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,119
are there is a technical component that

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,599
needs to

00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,880
in a way comes first now perhaps there

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,000
is a way to

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,400
to erode the

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,560
financial investment into making sure

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,880
that a few of those features released

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,040
the

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,720
the knowledge about these sort of

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,040
features can reach the people who can

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,760
actually then

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,640
sort of contribute more to the ecosystem

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,079
etc

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,359
i wouldn't know how to to jumpstart that

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,480
process to be honest

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:43,040
but i believe that just focusing on

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,839
on large employers or large companies et

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,920
cetera

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,119
although of course important since this

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,640
provides the

00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,119
money and the uh deployment for people

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,200
in the

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,599
in the areas cannot you know

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,240
make do without actually taking into

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,040
account

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,520
all of the of the community of people

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,079
who actually are interested in

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,359
because of its you know values or picks

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,920
or or whatever

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,320
so something is interesting rather than

00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,599
convenient or economically

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,800
um you know advantages etc

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,680
so i'm not sure that just focusing on

00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,640
companies that

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,520
are influenced by you know a lot of

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,880
factors that

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,160
are perhaps not under under the control

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,599
of the community

00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,200
and can be steered in a in a very

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,760
different difficult way

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,079
would actually help perhaps it should be

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,520
a two-pronged approach or something that

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,720
actually

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,440
does sort of increase the the interest

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,200
you know going along with that with

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,800
actual technical components that can

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:54,160
actually foster that interest of people

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,359
yeah i think the um the

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,760
components the perl needs to be

00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,560
uh standing on the ability to deliver

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,839
value

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,640
rather than any other um any other

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,720
message

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,920
we can't just say come use perl because

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,359
it's good and

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,880
the whole marketing thing and trying to

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,520
sell it because there's a there's

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,000
various

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,119
uh languages which have got far bigger

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,599
marketing

00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,319
budgets who would who would beat

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,079
anything

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:22,720
based on messaging but actually what

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,480
would work is delivery of value

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,720
if you look at some of the early

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,280
successes of perl and i i

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,920
use the word successes loosely of course

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,040
cgi

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,800
was very easy to get going some time ago

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,720
lots of people managed to get websites

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,920
with cgi working very quickly and of

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,720
course there were challenges with that

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,200
with the

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,720
original script archive but it solved a

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,400
problem it allowed people to get a thing

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,560
going really rapidly

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,599
um there's a point in the messaging

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,800
they're talking about

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,640
mvps minimum viable

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,560
products can you get something

00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,000
bootstrapped and up and running

00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,599
rapidly um and and does pearl deliver

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,040
some benefit there but it really is

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,680
about saying where does it work best

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,480
it's

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,680
it's the swiss army chainsaw came up in

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,040
a talk yesterday

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,040
so there's so many things it could do

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,440
but where's it best rather than

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,640
what are all the things that it could do

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,040
and i think that's what we need to focus

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,079
on

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,000
where can people really see that pearl

00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,880
delivers value we are talking much more

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,040
about pearl here than raku but i think

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,920
that's warranted because they are in

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,040
different

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,319
places in their life cycles uh the rahu

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,440
conversation will be very diff

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,560
different to this one but i think so i

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,000
think it's really about working out

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,480
where it does offer the most value

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,880
and focusing in on that and that's where

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,880
the people who are there every day

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,680
creating in perl developing um

00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,160
that's where that information is so jj

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:51,839
you have your hands up

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:56,319
yeah when you're talking about

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:59,760
where pearl and rocco offer value

00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:01,440
i think one one aspect in which they do

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,560
offer value is

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,880
in in how well they match

00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,839
how well they they uh they fit

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,480
the the the mental model of a developer

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,040
a lot of the

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,359
work for example that we're doing for

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:22,240
new microservices at work

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:24,000
is with go which is a fantastic language

00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,680
uh it's very fast it's very neat

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,200
documentation is great

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,359
i hate it like i i just don't like i

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,040
just don't enjoy it

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,040
um i

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,480
like i i can be writing something in

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,440
world that is

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,200
um that is going to be slower uh that is

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,400
going to be in some cases more effort

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,400
but i have more fun

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:53,280
i will prototype it faster

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:56,160
i i find it easy to navigate i find it

00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,160
easy to understand

00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,839
and ultimately i enjoy it more um i

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,240
enjoy

00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:03,200
more both when i'm writing pearl and

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,400
when i'm writing

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:10,560
raku and i think one way in which one

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:14,319
one aspect in which we can offer value

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,079
is in saying to for example

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,599
all those data scientists i i have

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,560
friends who are data scientists

00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,400
who feel like they have to use python

00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,440
and they hate it

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,119
because python brings to you know brings

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,480
a mental model that

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:34,000
may or may not fit those people

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:38,079
um if we are able to to show

00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,200
uh that there are that there are

00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:45,200
different languages that can fit

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:48,640
different developers uh better or worse

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,359
and present that as a possibility um

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,000
you know for example if there are like

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,440
for example

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,440
the recent developments that have been

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,760
going on with the trying to bring pdl

00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,880
back

00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,280
up to scratch um if we can if we can say

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,200
you know

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,280
you of course you can write like data

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,680
science in in python but you can also do

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,720
it in perl and if you find that pearl

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,640
fits your mental model better than

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,400
i know why not enjoy why not write it in

00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,160
a language that you can use

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,160
but that you can also enjoy um

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,480
i guess that's my two cents yes thank

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,280
you and and that's a comment that a few

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,520
people have

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,400
uh said i remember it was something that

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,599
uh that

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,319
that tux said when we met some time back

00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,319
um was that you think it and you can

00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,960
then articulate it very easily uh and

00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,880
and i think

00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,240
something else i heard was the pythons

00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,280
written for computers and pearls written

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,480
for people but

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,480
you know there's different views and i

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,240
think that those may well be

00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,160
um if we can draw that out and help

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,920
share that message with people it may

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,359
well be that there are people who can

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,960
um attach those messages recognize that

00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:57,760
um as well brett you have your hand up

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,280
uh yes thank you um this is related to

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,359
previous comments regarding

00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:06,319
um i i quantify it or describe it as

00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,880
application areas in which pearl you

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,359
know

00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,040
most of us would just go to pearl and

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,400
use pearl because that's that's what we

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,200
use

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,280
but by and large there are domain areas

00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,400
and application areas served

00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:23,520
by other languages the machine learning

00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:27,760
and and data sciences is a good example

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:31,280
uh with python and it's related to

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,520
things like computer vision so

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,440
i was wondering another good example for

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,720
example is um

00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,480
like gui gui uh

00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,800
application building so if i wanted to

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,800
create a an application

00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,480
that i wanted to i didn't want to be a

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,480
cloud application though maybe it could

00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,359
interact with cloud services for data

00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,560
and whatnot

00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:53,200
but i wanted a native gui say a wx

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,240
widget or

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,760
or gtk something that i could then

00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,599
distribute

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,960
you know i i would want to distribute it

00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,560
of course on linux or

00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:07,040
or for mac but most of my

00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,680
most of my users might might be on

00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,520
windows

00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,520
and i know that strawberry perl is a

00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,119
great infrastructure a great ecosystem

00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,640
for pearl and windows

00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,480
but another example that i was thinking

00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:20,079
of is you know are there

00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,800
are there um uh you know

00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,839
is pearl something that somebody would

00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,640
go to

00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:28,960
to create a gui application where maybe

00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,040
most of their users were

00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,319
on windows and it's kind of this it's

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,440
kind of the same thing it's

00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,640
it's application focused so given all of

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,640
that given that we know that

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,960
perl can do it can serve

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,839
a lot of different applications and be

00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,400
used

00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:48,079
where people specifically on windows may

00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,440
not even realize they're using a pro

00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,520
program

00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,520
it is there has there ever been any

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:57,440
conversation

00:46:53,520 --> 00:47:00,960
within the tpf or or elsewhere

00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:04,000
in terms of identifying say specific

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,760
application areas that you know

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,720
people would be interested in seeing

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,119
pearl i guess become

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,520
you know deliver the value in so for

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:16,960
example in computer vision

00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:19,920
open opencv is a really cool library

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,119
it's got a really great python uh

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,839
wrapper around it

00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,119
there's nothing like that within pearl

00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,400
if i was going to be doing computer

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,319
vision work and that that

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,160
goes a lot that is a big part of the

00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,160
machine learning stuff

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,240
you know i again going back to the

00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,160
previous uh speaker's point i

00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,559
i would have to use python or i would

00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,599
have to write my own

00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,400
pearl bindings for opencv so i guess

00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,440
when i'm

00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,520
my main question slash point is are

00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,119
have there ever been any thoughts or are

00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,160
there thoughts about

00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,280
targeting you know specific application

00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,680
areas

00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,440
and working either with with um

00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,160
community members who are interested in

00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,440
that

00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,480
or uh companies like wx widgets they

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,040
they maintain the uh a pearl their pearl

00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,240
uh

00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,440
bindings image magic maintains pearl

00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,359
magic

00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,400
has there any ever been any interface or

00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:17,760
discussions to specifically target

00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,000
areas in which pearl can has proven or

00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,240
has a strong potential to deliver

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,839
value and then putting some resources

00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,160
behind that

00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,280
so your point is very good as far as you

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,400
talk about opencv

00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,400
where there was a space and python uh

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,000
found a solution to it and were there

00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,599
and have developed well

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,800
what are the other spaces um i i

00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,119
currently

00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,880
we're not having specifically that

00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,880
conversation but i think

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,640
to identify a space that currently is

00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,319
not served

00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:52,640
um that would lend itself well

00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:54,319
to pearl and equally to raku there would

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,640
be no doubt different

00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,559
challenges but but one could consider a

00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,640
problem that would lend itself to pearl

00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,720
and one that would lend itself to raku

00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,559
then i i would have i would imagine that

00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,040
the the board would be very interested

00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,960
in

00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,160
and exploring how that could be

00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:12,079
supported and

00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,960
encouraged um what we would need is the

00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,640
the subject matter i'm working on a a

00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,680
project a healthcare project

00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,440
which i mentioned in a thread earlier on

00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,400
the chat

00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,200
where there is currently no there's no

00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,240
coverage

00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,000
um in really any language

00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,520
there's no implementation that that does

00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,040
the thing that's needed

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,200
and this effectively allows healthcare

00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,920
echoes to be joined up on a standards

00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,680
globally so um we're investing in

00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,079
building a a

00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,319
layer that translates that healthcare

00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,720
data into an open api

00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,839
um so so there's one that we've picked

00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,119
up internally and at some point when

00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,640
it's ready it'll be useful to start

00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,079
sharing that with others and

00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,440
and building it but that's that's

00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,240
because we have that problem to solve

00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,960
rather than

00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,599
and we're doing it in perl but not not

00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,119
because we

00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,200
we were looking for a thing to lend

00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,520
pearl to i i

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,359
i will come to michael just a sec but

00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,559
does anyone have any thoughts

00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:10,559
on on a niche that would lend

00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,240
itself well to pearl it would match well

00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,280
with pearl and michael of course jump in

00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,760
if that is what you were going to

00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,760
respond to

00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:25,119
on that stuart um i think

00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,240
an area that seems especially suitable

00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,480
for both languages

00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,280
is a focus on concision there has been a

00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,000
lot of research

00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,680
indicating that you know no matter the

00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,400
programming language bugs per line of

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,800
code

00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,319
is relatively constant and that one of

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,079
the best ways to have fewer bugs is to

00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:42,720
have fewer lines of code

00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,760
and i think both languages are uh

00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,200
excellent at

00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,040
generating achieving the same

00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,119
functionality in fewer lines of code and

00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,960
in many cases that makes the code

00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,319
easier to understand easier to reason

00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,760
about and

00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:58,000
um just easier to do everything with and

00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,200
i i think that especially if we're

00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,160
talking about a move

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,680
away from perl to java you know that is

00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,640
a real strength

00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,000
and one that is uh understandable to

00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,640
software developers and

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,520
to to managers um once you bring in the

00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,359
reliability aspect that comes from

00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,079
all the benefits of just having fewer

00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:20,559
fewer lines of code

00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:23,280
yeah so so a good point it's although

00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:26,160
not necessarily an application space

00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,960
that's a a good feature which uh should

00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,400
we need to

00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,599
to capture that and communicate that to

00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,720
our marketing team because those are the

00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,240
kind of features

00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,000
especially if we can put some science

00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,559
behind it um

00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,280
that adds another reason if somebody's

00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,359
considering

00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,800
what they need to choose that's why

00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,480
parliament would be useful

00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,160
this is brett again this is and this is

00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,680
just i appreciate the conversation this

00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,319
is just my final comment

00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:50,000
but one other benefit to to identifying

00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:53,040
these application areas or

00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,920
niches is it it would necessarily push

00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,200
the language

00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:00,240
both languages in uncomfortable

00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:03,119
uh you know directions and and maybe

00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,559
com bring to life some some interesting

00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,400
or needed features

00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,000
so i think there's so there's many

00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,640
advantages not only getting

00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,680
you know so market share and more

00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,559
developers

00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,160
but also finding out what what are the

00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,599
real features that these things are

00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,400
needing because right now

00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,520
what i've observed is that we spend a

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,680
lot of time

00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,599
talking about okay what features do we

00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,520
need and we're getting

00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,559
you know it's like an echo chamber we're

00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,599
talking about things that are

00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,280
interesting to us

00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,880
and things that we've maybe always

00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,319
wanted to see or things in other

00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,200
languages that

00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,079
we find interesting but but it's the

00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,240
application

00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,000
of the language that i think drives

00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,839
really useful features and there's got

00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,599
to be other features out there

00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,960
we just need to figure out how to find

00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,880
them well i think

00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,800
focusing on application area would start

00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,119
focusing on what the important features

00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,200
are

00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,680
for that uh we're short on time i would

00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,839
like to go to michael as you've been

00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,200
waiting and then if we have time nigel

00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:02,640
so michael please

00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:04,319
okay um well in these parts uh the uk at

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,680
least they're giving school children

00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:08,640
raspberry pi computers

00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,760
and teaching them python yeah and

00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,599
they're teaching them in a really

00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,119
terrible and horrible boring way

00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:16,480
because of course it's the school

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,960
teacher who's done a conversion course

00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,640
perhaps bring the uh fun of uh pearls of

00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,119
children

00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,240
yeah definitely i think the biggest

00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,359
missed opportunity for

00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,880
pearl was raspberry pi that's one

00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,079
one of them but yes i think that's a

00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,559
really good point bringing getting

00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,280
people

00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,400
young enjoying it may be good these are

00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,200
the kind of things to bring to the

00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,200
community

00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,440
uh representatives meeting for both of

00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,000
these one considering what application

00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,480
spaces

00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,359
may well lend themselves well to pearl

00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,960
and raku

00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:46,400
and two if you're interested there

00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,720
michael come along to the

00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,720
meeting and if you'd like to explore how

00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,480
we might do something with that

00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,480
then then let's go and do it

00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,839
so i welcome you to join us as an

00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,640
invitation if you if you

00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:01,119
would like to come and share your

00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,119
thoughts there

00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:08,960
um nigel yeah i just wanted to quickly

00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,680
share the idea that uh

00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,240
i think actually pearl's good for

00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,559
solopreneurs

00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,800
or small startup teams i've worked in a

00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,880
number of startups and pearl's been

00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,640
absolutely essential to the success of

00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,920
the project so

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:27,119
um you know i think um

00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,319
maybe we could think about sort of

00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:31,040
earning money

00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:32,000
individually as coders or small teams of

00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,880
coders

00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,240
uh working on smaller problems uh you

00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,520
know there are lots of different niches

00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,400
out there so

00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,280
um having a kind of a solopreneur

00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,640
approach

00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,960
because there is a certain point where

00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:47,119
pearl code bases in pearl like a hundred

00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,440
thousand lines of pearl

00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:50,559
it automatically starts to steam up at

00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,960
that point

00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,839
and it's just one of those things so

00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,760
it's

00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:58,160
it kind of does lend itself to small

00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,079
teams um

00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:02,960
yeah so that's just my point so that

00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:05,680
maybe that could be its niche

00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,000
yes absolutely i that and we need to

00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,920
explore

00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,200
that we need to possibly look at that

00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,599
two or three others

00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,799

there in the chat as well

00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:21,920

00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,640
point there is is become involved this

00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,200
is what

00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,960
tpf can do is it can help bring people

00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,520
together and turn these ideas

00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,559
these initiatives into something

00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,799
actionable

00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:38,480

why you started using perl you've shown

00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,839
it it worked

00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,680
good you know let's have more people

00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:47,440

00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,720
so uh yes i think there's some really

00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,720
good points there

in that last minute

00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,599
no okay well i would encourage people to

00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,480
think about what application areas that

00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,960
would be a

00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,400
a very interesting area for us to focus

00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,640
on and explore further

00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,760
so if you have any thoughts around that

00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,040
then get in touch

on the slack channel or by email

00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,280
and i think we we can add that as one of

00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:20,960
our initiatives going forward to see if

00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,200
if that's something that's worth us as

00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,839
exploring further

00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,480
