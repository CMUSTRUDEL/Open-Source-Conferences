Description: 
	This talk will be based upon the article I had published on LinkedIn where I had debunked Perl myths with facts. Yes, I will be preaching to choir here, but, I want to take this opportunity as a way to thank the Perl Community  and core Perl developers for all their fantastic work.

As someone who frequently dabbles with Perl (albeit intermittently), I was totally aghast by the articles and videos on the internet picturing Perl to be
1) A horrendous language designed to make the life of it's users miserable.
2) A "better alternative to shell scripting"
3) A dying language that no one should touch with a barge pole.
4) A weird mix of the 3 options given above.

In my personal experience, none of the above are true. Perl is a fantastic general purpose language, is far far more powerful than bash/zsh/ etc and is certainly NOT a dying language.

This is my attempt, as a generic Perl User to debunk these myths.
