00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,480
south southern hemisphere

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,560
it means winter for you and if you are

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,960
you know far then welcome to the

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,399
conference

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,680
the next slide yes so in summer

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,000
we do a lot of internship-ish things

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,840
google some of code google season docs

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,200
and outreach

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,360
what we do depends on here this year

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,360
we are doing the bottom two the last

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,719
year we did outreachy

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,280
and next year i want to do all three

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,320
um but to make it happen i need

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,360
volunteers

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,280
which i will talk in a minute so what do

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,320
we do one by one

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,120
um google summer of code it is a paid

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,960
internship

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,960
so basically google um hires interns

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,600
than they pay and then they work for

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,720
three

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,600
months on power or iraqi projects and it

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,600
is open

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,320
for students and if you go to the next

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,320
slide

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,600
here's what we did recently

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,280
so as you can see you know we

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,520
hire men we take volunteer mentor

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,600
then we hire interns then we match and

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,159
they work on the project

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,240
so that is google some of those google

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,560
sum of code

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,600
now of google season of docs

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,200
we have jason working with us to

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,799
organize us

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,000
so i will let him speak all right

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,360
uh thank you pakoda um yes season

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,759
of docs is a google program where they

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,000
offer

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,759
funds to a number of open source

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,240
organizations to assist with

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,280
a documentation project uh this is a

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,080
little different from

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,640
summer of code um instead of working

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,239
with

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,000
interns newer to programming

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,440
organizations are expected to use the

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,840
granted funds to hire

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,760
professional technical writers uh this

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,280
year with the blessing of both the pearl

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,160
steering council and the pearl

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,879
foundation

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,760
i pitched google a project for auditing

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,160
pearl's

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,800
core documentation uh they ended up

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,840
selecting this as one of 30 projects

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,200
they would fund

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,040
for 2021's season of dogs

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,239
so for this project the pearl foundation

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,560
has hired hawar

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,239
latif khan a technical writer and

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,720
communication specialist um

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,519
khawar is a season of docs veteran he

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,760
has delivered

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,280
a documentation audit last year for the

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,319
es lynch project

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,720
and he began his work last month and

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,560
we're all pretty stoked about it and i

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,080
think we'll have a little bit say about

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,840
how you can get involved

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,840
at the end of this let me talk thanks

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,120
thank you jason and we're moving on

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,760
outreachy

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,480
is something similar to google sum of

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,560
code

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,519
um it is also paid internship three

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,560
months

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,280
um it used to target

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,080
women but they grew to invite other

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,280
diversity categories

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,640
so and likewise if you go to the next

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,080
slide we do

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,720
have a number of projects and actually

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,360
right after me and stefan is going to

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,560
talk about

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,400
open food facts which he is working on

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,400
with intern this year

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,599
and we get good feedback from interns

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,720
you don't have to read everything now

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,000
but

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,640
basically interns learn paul were

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,799
accurate

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,840
and then they learn new technology and

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,080
then they

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,040
add value to the paul and rocky

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,480
community

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,439
and then they they graduate

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,080
so again stefan will talk more about

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:10,000
reggie program he's working was here

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:13,040
