Publication date: 2021-06-09
Playlist: TPC 2021 in the Cloud
Description: 
	Walk-in with zero regex knowledge, walk out with solid Regexp knowledge and a global lay of the land.

Regular Expressions are not nearly as standard as they may seem.  In this talk, we’ll provide an overview of regular expressions, their history, use cases, and alternative techniques.  Then, we’ll walk through the tools in the regexp toolbox (chars, wildcards, character classes, assertions, etc) with examples in PCRE, Perl, and Raku syntax.  Finally we’ll summarize and analyze the variations in regular expression syntax and provide some closing thoughts on regex and regex portability.
