Description: 
	Perl is everywhere, and that includes most base configurations in CI/CD environments. Leveraging the system Perl they have, and the libraries installed by default is quite easy if you know how. In this talk we'll tell you how to use your favorite language in Travis, GitHub Actions and others.

I was very happy the day I discovered I could use Perl in any GitHub action, since it's installed there *by default*. From then on, I discovered it can also be used in other environments, such as Travis, and even Docker Hub. Doing a bit of automation using Perl is incredibly easy that way. We'll tell you how to do common tasks using Perl, as well as how to use installed libraries, install your own, or use Github::Actions, a CPAN module, to help you write GitHub actions steps.

The main advantage is the presence of a Git Perl module there, but there are many other things you can do to.
