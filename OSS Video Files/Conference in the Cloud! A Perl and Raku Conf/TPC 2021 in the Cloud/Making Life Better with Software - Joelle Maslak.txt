Title: Making Life Better with Software - Joelle Maslak
Publication date: 2021-06-08
Playlist: TPC 2021 in the Cloud
Description: 
	Software improves my life. I'll talk about how I designed software for my own needs and how this can be generalized to designing software for users who have needs outside the mainstream. I'll talk about how I designed software to meet my needs in this talk, showing the iterative process I used.

Imagine writing software that helps people participate in the world! How do you avoid building systems for people as you think they are, rather than people as they actually are? I'll examine assistive and accessible technology I use, and how the software (most of which was created by myself) was designed. Throughout the presentation, while some Raku will be demonstrated, the presentation will be accessible to people who code in any language, with a focus on the process used to define requirements and design the various tools I use. Throughout, I'll also examine mistakes commonly made by technologists when designing accessible or assistive technology, and how you can avoid those mistakes in your own work.

okay thank you for speaking

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,160
no problem uh welcome to making life

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,240
better with software

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,440
i wanted to have a really catchy title

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,480
this isn't it

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,960
uh but it's what we'll go with i'm joel

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,960
maslak maslach

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,720
as soon as i get my slide it's going

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,359
there we go uh

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,439
the talk today is going focus on uh

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,920
three applications

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,840
uh that i've written to help myself out

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,399
with various things

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,920
i've needed help with one of them is a

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,360
router command line interface

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,000
colorization script

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,200
another is a voice training application

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,559
and the third is an

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,280
in in a meeting kind of a on the air

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,399
busy indicator and i'll explain these as

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,399
i go through them

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,480
what they did and how the design process

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,640
went into these applications

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,120
uh they made a variety of my needs some

00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,239
are related to neurodivergence some are

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,800
social some are other things but through

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,960
all of them

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,080
the key points that i'll be reminding

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,479
everyone of

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,840
is that understanding the user is

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,960
critical when you're building an

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,080
application

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,080
we all know that but you'll see how how

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,080
that plays out with these applications

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,439
uh as well as the process is iterative

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,240
because you won't get it right the first

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,240
time

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,840
and sometimes you go far enough down the

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,240
wrong path that you have to throw it

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,640
away and start over

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,000
this applies to any application not just

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,439
these applications are

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,439
designed to make someone's life maybe a

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,600
little better but

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,880
uh this is a good this is a good

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,320
framework to explore this

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,000
so first who am i i've been developing

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,439
pearl for 25 years

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,880
uh so quite quite a while uh

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,560
i remember five point very early

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,920
uh i've also been developing uh raku for

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,360
five years since christmas and i'm the

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,159
author of several pearl

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,560
and raku modules the ones i'm most proud

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,040
of

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,080
are raku's net bgp which is a bgp stack

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,680
written entirely in raku and

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,680
pearl's parallel work unit which is a

00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:17,120
multi-paradigm

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,200
parallel processing application

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,640
i'm currently employed at netflix as a

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,080
network engineer

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,480
so if you're watching netflix and it

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,720
rebuffers that might be my fault

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,520
if it doesn't rebuffer that's because

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,160
all of my

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,519
uh stunning colleagues did a fantastic

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,800
job making a very resilient application

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,360
previously i've worked in government

00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,599
telecoms.com

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,160
so i have a lot of exposure to the

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,160
industry

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,720
so what makes me qualified to give this

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,720
talk

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,959
the first thing that helps me understand

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,319
this

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,120
area is i am myself neurodivergent

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,879
uh because of that i see things a little

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,159
differently than a lot of people

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,680
and i since i'm a programmer i say okay

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,200
i can make software do do things that

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,760
maybe i have a harder time with

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,400
let the computer do the hard stuff uh

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,959
i'm passionate about inclusion

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,840
and i've written numerous applications

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,680
uh

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,200
in this space not just for myself but

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,280
for other people too

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,280
for instance i've written assistive and

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,720
augmentative communication software and

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,760
i'll talk about that

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,720
uh during this talk and

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,560
i've personally experienced what what

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,840
software without inclusion in mind looks

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,159
like

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,120
and it's it's not what any of us want

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,120
software to look like

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,120
so the first kind of problem i'm going

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,799
to talk about isn't one of the three

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,680
applications i promise to talk about but

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,080
it's about

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,640
communication that'll set the framework

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,080
for the others

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,560
so if someone maybe can't speak uh

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,840
but they have language skills they'll

00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,680
use an application

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,080
like what's pictured here a lot of times

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,080
this might be running on an ipad

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,879
uh it has various words has folders with

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,920
more words

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,239
there's variations on this theme where

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,720
a keyboard uh where if someone can spell

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,959
there's variations on the scene where

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,560
it's an entire language system which is

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,919
fascinating in itself but beyond the

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,079
scope of this talk

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,919
but essentially it lets someone

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,680
construct a sentence and speak

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,520
it you still need to know language to do

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,600
this not everyone has has

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,960
that ability but for people that do and

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,160
cannot speak

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,080
this is kind of the go-to method for

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,280
solving that problem

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,320
and it's a fantastic method to solve the

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,199
problem

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,360
but maybe it's not always the right

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,520
method to solve the problem

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,720
uh and i'm going to give a few different

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,360
scenarios

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,759
of showing how would the solution maybe

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,560
the technologists come up with

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,240
maybe don't work in all the situations

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,720
and what i'm trying to show here

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,960
is again understanding the user which

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,320
also means understanding the environment

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,320
that the user is in

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,720
so i give one example is

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,600
white water rafting uh

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,039
if you're going white water rafting you

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,759
probably don't want to take

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,320
a relatively expensive device if it's an

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,639
ipad

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,240
that's might be a thousand dollar device

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,600
if it's a specialized speech device it

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,840
might be a 15 000

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,880
device so you're going to be concerned

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,960
about

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,400
am i going to lose it is it going to get

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,360
damaged in the water

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,639
uh all of that in addition if you're in

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,280
the middle of a river

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,360
it's going to be loud so is anyone going

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,479
here that little speaker on that device

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,000
probably not uh people that speak will

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,400
probably be yelling at each other to be

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,560
heard

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,840
over that uh and the device probably

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,479
doesn't stand a chance

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,880
i there's also lots of movement required

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,759
to use say a touch screen when you're

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,160
bouncing around

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,800
in a raft you're not going to be able to

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,840
make those

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,759
fine motor movements

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,360
but there's plus two of that environment

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,400
is that there's not a lot you need to

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,919
communicate

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,759
right in the middle of the water you're

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,199
probably not going to have huge

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,720
conversations you're you're it's

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,240
probably going to be more tactical of

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,880
okay we need to avoid that rock

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,520
or whatever people do when they wa water

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,680
raft because i don't do it

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,360
but i'm imagining that pointing and

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,120
gestures are likely

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800
very useful that's a form of

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,120
communication that's just as valid as

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,240
any other form of communication

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,759
and then for more complicated things a

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,880
letter board or a symbol board to be

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,280
cheaply made

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,039
uh that's simply an alphabet print it

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,639
out you laminate it now it's

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,000
safe in the water heck you can take

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
three or four of them in case you lose

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,560
one

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,800
uh and you still got a way of

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,880
communicating in that environment

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,319
but then there's the other part when

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,440
you're not in the middle of the rapids

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,120
when you're not

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,120
in a situation where in the water maybe

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,960
you're eating lunch maybe you're

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,240
at a portage maybe you're camping for

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,000
the night

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,360
well then you might want that device

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,280
back so

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,960
the needs of this one person could

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,560
change depending on their situation

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,919
another example is in bed with an

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,599
intimate partner and i promise i keep

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,479
this pg rated

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,520
uh you might not want to break away from

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,120
the action to start typing on a device

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,039
uh but you may have things you want to

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,000
communicate so there's probably

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,039
a lot of non-verbal communication uh

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,840
gestures pointing guiding

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,880
vocalizations or things like aha and as

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,880
well as whatever else

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,280
but you have an advantage in the

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,199
situation and that's that

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,039
the partner hopefully is also motivated

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,400
to be in this situation

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,400
and thus is interested in

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,759
learning your ways of communicating so

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
if for instance you could do sign

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,960
language

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,440
maybe in the world as a whole

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,960
sign language isn't good with people

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,879
that don't know it

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,160
but with someone that is an intimate

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,520
partner

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,639
expecting them to learn a little sign

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,879
language probably isn't unrealistic

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,160
so there is a big advantage there and

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,680
you open up a lot of

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,199
communication options that wouldn't

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,240
exist

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,360
in other situations uh

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,360
there's probably also a lot of

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,400
communication in advance you've talked

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,479
about hopefully

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,800
uh what kind of things you might might

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,160
enjoy uh

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,599
i give an example of maybe an uh

00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,800
augmentative or assistive communication

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,479
technique here

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,240
uh which is you could have small

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,399
laminated cards with activities or

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,440
desires or etc and you could just

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,719
pass it to someone uh in these times

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,399
so i mean there's it's a different

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,399
environment so it's a different need

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,600
another one think about how you how this

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,200
device would work at a concert

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,720
it's going to be very very loud at a lot

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,560
of concerts

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,000
but then i say concert am i talking an

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,440
orchestra performance

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,160
or am i talking someone that wants to be

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,360
in the mosh pit at a punk rock concert

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,399
that might change what you suggest for

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,519
communication there might be security

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,959
restrictions where they don't want a

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,720
device that can record

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,320
being brought in what do you do then uh

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,760
obviously there's gonna be concerns in

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,760
some of these situations about breaking

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,680
the device or losing it

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,279
so you probably wanna also have a backup

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,880
form of communication

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,560
in case you need to communicate in case

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,680
something happens to your primary form

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,600
and you need a backup

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,279
maybe a pencil and paper works fine uh

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
and again if you went with someone else

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,240
you may have a partner there that can

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,120
help communicate maybe know

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,440
those some form of communication that

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,880
the general public doesn't

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,560
and kind of the last scenario i'll talk

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,440
about with this just to show

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,880
how knowing your user is not a simple

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,320
process

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,000
is let's say you're going through

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,279
airport security you're traveling

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,279
somewhere

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,120
well you might have to surrender uh

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,360
electronic device like an ipad so it can

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,080
be

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,040
x-rayed how do you communicate if

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,839
something comes up

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,680
you need to talk during that time uh

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,680
well it might be just a note that exp

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,720
that you can hand to the tsa person and

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,200
say

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,399
that the note just says i need a device

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,720
to communicate

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,440
it's a and you could kind of point

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
towards the

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,480
x-ray machine that probably get the

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,440
point across or you could bring a pencil

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,040
and paper

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,640
or some other method one advantage of

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,760
airport security is you generally know

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,800
what they're going to do you know what

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,640
they're going to want you to do

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,640
you know what you're going need to say

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,160
they might ask you about your device

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,920
so you might have a note that says this

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,959
is my communication device please be

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,920
careful with it

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,720
because we know airlines respect fragile

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,800
uh

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,000
but whatever you you're you're doing you

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,480
could you could

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,839
script some of this stuff so that opens

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,839
up different options than if you can't

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,600
so thinking about this continuing

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,200
okay now what about other people well if

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,600
a person seated most of the day

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,120
instead of standing and walking you

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,640
might have different options

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,000
maybe something with the keyboard works

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,399
great if someone's sitting but if

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,839
they're

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,040
walking all day that would be a

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,040
difficult thing to use

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,519
if you know that the person is an

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,680
exceptionally good typist

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,560
you might not want to do word prediction

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,920
you might want to

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,240
because word prediction will actually

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,760
slow down a fast typist

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,440
but if they have difficulty with

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,399
volunteering voter movements and it's

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,160
very

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,959
time consuming for them to select the

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,360
symbol then that word prediction is

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,640
a huge benefit so that's some of the

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,160
complications of this

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,680
and i want you to think about those

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,839
themes as

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,079
as we go through so now i'll talk about

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,920
something i built for myself i'm a

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,240
network engineer

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,760
which means i spend a lot of time logged

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,720
into routers

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,360
and frankly routers don't have very good

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,360
interfaces

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,120
the text interface is the standard way

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,120
of interfacing with these routers

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,959
yes there's automation yes there's all

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,360
kinds of tooling that can be

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,120
added on but at the end of the day you

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,839
still occasionally have to see that

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,160
command line interface because of my

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,040
neurodivergence

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,440
i have trouble with a sea of text and

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,399
the sea of text on a lot of routers

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,600
has no information hierarchy no good

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,800
information hierarchy so it's hard to

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,160
see what's important what's not

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,160
important what's a detail

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,480
what clarifies something else they're

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,839
not laid out by someone that understood

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,959
that kind of design they were laid out

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:34,079
by an engineer 30 years ago

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,040
who got it working probably on a 6800

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,240
cpu or something along those lines

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,839
so that was my first issue

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,560
then i know myself and i know i'm very

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,839
prone to making transcription errors

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,079
i i in a lot of router configurations

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,160
you have to put the same

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,680
ipad address in four different spots you

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,480
might have to have it in an ip

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,480
apple and you might have to have it in a

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,639
bgp pier

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,560
so you want those ip addresses to be the

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,120
same in both places well if someone has

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,240
trouble

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,079
with that particular skill that's that's

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,519
that's a difficulty how can how can i

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,079
solve this

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:17,440
and then i show uh a couple numbers here

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,639
so i show this number and is it this

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,639
number

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,480
or this number well i

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,839
that will take me quite a while to

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,920
figure out it's i

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,440
i will lose lose track when i start

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,519
counting the zeros

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,800
so i'm thinking how can i make this

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,800
easier for me because there's a lot of

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,959
numbers on a router

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,959
so what if i could redesign the router

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,160
output

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,720
and then i think well i can do that i

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,880
can

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,079
pipe ssh that i'm connecting to a router

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,560
with i can pipe it through

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:52,000
a script i can write the script in raku

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,639
i can reformat it however i want

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,079
so that's that's how i started to kind

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,040
of show you what i was talking about

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,120
this is a

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,079
command uh showing i uh bgp neighbor

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,120
details

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,040
on one of my uh home network devices

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,639
as you see a lot of text there it's very

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,680
dense and it's hard to tell what's

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:15,279
important and what's not

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,440
so that was kind of the first questions

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,880
look locating the information in the sea

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,040
of text

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,000
so if i had two questions these are very

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,240
common questions

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,360
for a network engineer what's the status

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,519
of a bgp session

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,560
and what was the last error on that

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,000
session

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,160
so i know how to debug it or

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,360
troubleshoot it

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,560
again quickly find that i have trouble

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,639
with that

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,320
even though i do this full time for a

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,800
long time

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,279
[Music]

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,600
so here's the output of my script that

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,519
helps find that information

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,519
uh as you see it adds some adds a lot of

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,720
color

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,959
so the first question is what's the

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,399
status of the session well i can look at

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,639
this now

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,600
and immediately i can tell oh it's

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,040
established it's been up for 36 days

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,120
done i've answered my question i didn't

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,800
have to search the screen it stood out

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,160
because i highlighted in green because

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,399
green means in this

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,519
application anything relatively

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,120
important that's good

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,720
that shows up in green if it's bad it

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,160
shows up in red so if the session was

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,760
down there'd be a red line there instead

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,920
then what was the last error what

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,920
happened last time it was

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,720
experiencing a problem and again

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,600
it stands right out to me uh it was a

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,079
socket air

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,360
i i had i received one and a set one

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,320
about the same time

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,560
36 days ago network was unreachable and

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,480
also connection closed by pier

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,920
uh just being a network engineer i know

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,320
that probably means the other end was

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,240
rebooting or something along those lines

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,000
uh the connection the network

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,720
unreachable the the link was probably

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,360
down the

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,040
connection closed by pure the link was

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,959
probably up but the other end wasn't

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,720
accepting the connection yet

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,240
so now i have the information i know how

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,759
to debug it i look in this and i say

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,920
okay this link's probably pretty good

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,279
this bgp session is probably working

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,079
fine

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,800
but compare that to what it looks like

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,399
without

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,079
the script

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,759
the second thing i wanted it to do was

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,040
highlight the errors

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,079
so i can spot the problems real easy

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,959
this is the output showing 12

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,279
fiber interfaces on this router and what

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,959
their current light levels are

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,720
and i can spot this one this one's

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,800
pretty easy but they're not always quite

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,000
this easy to spot

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,320
but going through my script

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,880
it's obvious which interfaces have a

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,440
problem and as i look at that i can say

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,720
oh i know exactly what the problem is

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,519
there's no light on this interface

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,279
because -30 happens to be this router's

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,240
way of saying i'm not receiving any

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,240
light from the far end

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,079
then i'm going to talk about

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,040
transcription errors because i mentioned

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,399
that being a difficulty

00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:01,839
and i see at least one person got it uh

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:06,079
the so this is showing uh

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:10,799
showing bgp bgp route

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:13,199
to this one ip address 192.168.149.2

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,039
and i'm receiving three bgp routes and

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,799
if you're not familiar with

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,640
kind of how this output works i'll draw

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,000
some squares around it that's not part

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,520
of the script but

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,600
it's something if you're not familiar

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,319
looking at it will help

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,160
and i can tell some information really

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,919
quickly by looking at this

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,760
thanks to the colorization of these ip

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,600
addresses

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,720
and let me explain kind of how how this

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:40,080
colorization works

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:45,200
i convert the ip address which is

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:48,160
everything before the slash

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,919
that's the ip address and i also add in

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,679
the

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:56,160
the net the prefix length to that

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,880
integer convert that to an integer and

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,960
then i do

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,280
modular arithmetic on it modulo 7 and i

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,080
have a seven colors in a look up table

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,080
that i can highlight it as

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,600
that will catch most of my transposition

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,559
errors most of my typos

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,480
all of that kind of stuff and i can you

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,280
you will see some of these

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,039
ip addresses will have the same color

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,880
even though

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,400
even though they're different ip

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,880
addresses

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,480
but generally they're different enough

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,360
that i can spot their different despite

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,080
the color

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,880
and you can't have infinite number of

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,480
colors

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,559
at least i can't differentiate an

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,720
infinite number of colors

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,559
uh but what i can see in this is i see

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,320
okay i've got three bgp routes this

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:45,360
router is receiving to reach this

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:49,120
ip address and i can immediately tell

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,799
hey that is the same as that

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,480
in the bgp output what's in the

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,720
parentheses there is

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,480
something called the router id each

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,080
router on the internet has a unique id

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,000
identifying it it's usually one of the

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,280
ip addresses that's associated with

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,679
the router because they're globally

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,520
unique and

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,720
immediately i can see okay this one

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,360
router has

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,799
two links to my router i have two bgp

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,720
sessions with this router

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,679
but it's the same router that might help

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,360
me a great deal in troubleshooting

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,720
uh so that's the kind of thing that this

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,360
can do in addition to just

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,559
preventing errors if i type in an ip

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,200
address and it comes up a different

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,690
color

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,840
i know i did something wrong

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:31,039
[Music]

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,960
and then the number question again

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,400
with commas i can clearly see the

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,600
difference between these numbers no

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,200
problem at all

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,679
without the commas i can't and i

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,200
couldn't tell you at a glance which one

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,799
of these numbers

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,120
it was so again that's the router

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,080
interface as you can see

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,080
lots of numbers

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,440
all over the place sometimes they're

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,440
pretty big numbers

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,679
so my solution was

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,320
i didn't want to add commas because if i

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,000
added commas

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,679
that would change the formatting of this

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,960
output and sometimes these numbers will

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,720
appear in tables or

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,400
something that are nicely formatted or

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,039
relatively nicely formatted

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,000
i didn't want to try tackling that

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,840
problem

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,679
so instead i looked for something didn't

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,480
take up any space

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,000
and so i underlined alternating three

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,400
digits

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,080
so i could basically visually see the

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,960
same thing i'd see with the commas

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:36,720
i can easily tell that's 10 million now

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,320
so i can look at this and say

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,720
okay what's that number what's the

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,799
bandwidth on that interface

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,760
is it is it 10 million kilobits

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,720
is it 1 million kilobits is 100 000

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,720
kilobits what is it

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,039
right through the script instantly i

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,080
know okay

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,760
10 million kilobits why they put it in

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,520
kilobits there i don't know but that's

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,120
10 gigabit interface

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,840
and i know that right away and sure

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,000
enough it also matches what it should be

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,120
but the bandwidth is configured to use

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,080
the full interface

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,039
everything's proper i can also see this

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,039
with

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,520
other numbers on the same

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,520
on the same output and i can easily tell

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,320
what magnitude all these numbers are

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,320
just at a glance

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:32,159
so how did i do this i did with raku

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,760
and a ton of regexes lots and lots of

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,360
regexes

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,720
uh i also have i'm going up the previous

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,960
talk which did an ali

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,919
a previous talk which did an alias i did

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,520
a whole bash function for this

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,960
and i'll explain why i did the bash

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,720
function in a minute

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,640
uh but this is this is the clue why i

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,440
did it i only wanted my colorization

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,200
script

00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:02,559
to run if i was connecting to a router

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,400
so that's an example of raku red regex's

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:08,080
it's probably an eye test

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,880
uh to look at this uh but just i i find

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,600
them very readable very verbose

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,080
a lot nicer than a lot of other regex

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,080
engines

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,120
so now getting back to those kind of

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,120
three questions

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:28,720
knowing the user knowing uh

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,400
the iterative process and

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,280
sometimes you have to throw things away

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,280
in this case looking at the user

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,880
these are some questions where if i was

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,559
writing this for someone else what might

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,400
i do differently

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,400
well the first thing is if someone's red

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,679
green color blind my colorization of

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,000
things is red and green

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,760
is the wrong choice maybe i can do

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,280
inverse text or something for

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,480
errors uh if someone's using a screen

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,480
reader

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,600
my clever underlining probably isn't as

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,120
clever

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,960
so i might do a different thing i might

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,720
phrase that do do something differently

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,320
to call out things on the screen reader

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,679
or remove things that maybe would just

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,880
be distracting on a screen reader

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,400
some people with different

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,559
neurodivergence might find all that

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,000
colorization that kind of angry fruit

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,240
salad look

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,320
really distracting so you might do

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,200
something different

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,000
i wrote this for my needs i'm oftentimes

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,320
configuring

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,559
or troubleshooting something but if i

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,919
was interested in inventorying

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,280
routers i might care about serial

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,880
numbers that might be something very

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,880
valuable to me

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,000
but for my for what i do for a living

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,159
it's not

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,720
so i didn't colorize i didn't make it

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,880
stand out

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,880
and then of course internationalization

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,360
concerns

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,360
a lot of people use that style of

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,400
grouping digits

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,000
uh billions of people use that style of

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,559
grouping digits

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,679
so i might want to group the digits

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,600
differently or have that at least

00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:01,039
configurable

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,480
i will say that i'd love to see the

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,840
router manufacturers incorporate at

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,320
least a few of these things into their

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,159
routers

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,440
cisco's done a little bit with the human

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,880
readable option and some of their

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,120
commands

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:15,120
but there's definitely

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,360
there's definitely a lot of room to grow

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,360
there

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,559
what i learned kind of through the

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,840
iteration process and also just learn

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,840
learning through this

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:29,039
i learned re raku's regexes and grammars

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,159
are absolutely wonderful uh

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:34,000
they're very expressive they let you

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,600
they let you do pretty much anything you

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,440
could possibly want you to do

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,880
uh so i'm very efficient when i'm

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,159
writing regexes in

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:45,120
raku however the performance

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,159
isn't good and i wish i could say it was

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,200
but it's not

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,480
uh and that's one of the reasons i turn

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,320
the filter off

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,760
when i'm going to a device that's not a

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,360
router

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,039
if there's a lot of output it can

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,520
sometimes be a noticeable

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,600
speed decrease because going through

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,120
hundreds of these regexes

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,960
uh some of them more efficient than

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,159
others uh

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,720
so that that's that's a lesson i learned

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,400
and it's

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,840
i'm i'm seeing change and raku is

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,279
faster today than it was two years ago

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,159
it's gonna be faster in two years than

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,200
it was

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,640
this year uh but that's one area where i

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,320
hope there's some focus and

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:28,400
improvements made so

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:31,120
that was my iteration though was

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,480
looking at the different needs i had

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,320
because i started with just

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,400
oh just pull out the errors and then i

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,200
said okay but i have trouble with these

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,520
numbers

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,279
so then i underlined the numbers they

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,520
said okay this is all working good but

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,600
i'm typing ip addresses

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,279
and so adding on to that i didn't

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,799
foresee all of those things

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,000
when i started writing i wrote it for

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:54,559
one problem and then added it to

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,960
a whole whole bunch of other whole added

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,720
a whole bunch of other needs to it

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,840
uh as a result i'm way more efficient at

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,159
my job i use the script every day

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,000
i didn't throw anything away uh

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,440
unfortunately i was able to find ways to

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,600
make the regexes fast enough to do

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,799
everything i needed it to do

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,640
but that was probably where i was

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,760
probably most close to having to start

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,760
over and throw things away

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,240
so i'll talk about a second problem

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,240
voice training

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,480
is i wanted my voice to be a little

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,840
different than it was

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,200
and now i'm really conscious of that

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,559
because i'm talking about it and

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,320
everyone else is paying attention to my

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,960
voice but that's fine

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,159
uh i'm in front of the computer most of

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,400
the day i work

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,600
remotely i work in front of a bunch of

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:45,200
screens i'm on video conferences all day

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,120
so i kind of have a pretty fixed

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,640
environment that how can i make this

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,640
environment

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,440
help give me feedback about my voice

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,320
uh so what if my computer gave me the

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,840
hints

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,440
but i want them in a non-distracting way

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,050
because i want to be able to concentrate

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,640
on the people i'm talking to

00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:05,600
[Music]

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,440
and i i thought okay i'll think about

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,600
that maybe some kind of traffic light

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,520
kind of solution something i can see out

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,960
of the corner of my eye

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,960
and then i i started thinking okay but

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,480
how do i figure out what i'm interested

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,240
in in this particular case i was

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,360
interested in

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,279
in pitch so

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,440
i was thinking i bet someone figured out

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,480
all that hard math all those ffts and

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,720
such that i

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,480
don't remember from college i bet

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,440
someone else has built a library for

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,120
this

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,200
and then i wanted it to be cross

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,240
platform because sometimes i might be on

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,880
video on a

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,760
windows box sometimes on linux sometimes

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,039
on mac

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,279
so it needed to work on all these

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,360
platforms

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,960
so that's part of kind of starting to

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,760
know the user

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,760
and then knowing the user's goals my

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,600
main focus was on pitch

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,799
so i wanted to keep i went above 180

00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,480
hertz ideally

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,559
never below 160 in between's okay

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,640
and i want to know when i'm not doing

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,240
what i want now i know when i am doing

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,679
what i want

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,080
so okay how do i solve this

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,279
this is the typical solution uh that

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,240
people do when they're doing voice

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,640
training

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,240
is this is one at one example of an

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,760
application this voice pitch monitor

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,559
runs on an iphone

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,720
and it shows a graph over time uh the

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,000
horizontal axis is timed vertical axis

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,880
is pitch

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,120
and the yellow is what was what the

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,600
pitch was at various times

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,640
so that's the normal app but it's a

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,120
pretty visually

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,559
complicated thing you're not going to

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,399
catch that out of your corner your eye

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,039
and know what's going on

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,039
all right i also didn't want another

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,480
screen in front of me

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,840
i didn't want to have a phone running

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,440
all the time with that with an

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,279
application on it

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,880
i'm i'm not doing dedicated voice

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,000
training i'm doing this as feedback

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,679
during my normal

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,279
day so i need to be able to focus on the

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,559
video calls or whatever else

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,360
that's where i got the traffic light

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,399
uh the background noise was also

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,039
something i noticed with these

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,279
applications

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,200
they tend to lock on to any sound no

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,320
matter how faint it was

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,679
and that was an issue

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,279
so okay i've kind of got an idea i want

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,240
to do a traffic light analyze the pitch

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,559
so what language

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,840
[Music]

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,679
well the first thing i want to do is i

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,960
want to find that library that could do

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,159
that pitch analysis

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,640
and i found one audio it looked perfect

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,760
as cross

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,799
platform uh its usage was dead simple

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,960
you open a stream

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,480
you set up a pitch detector you loop

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,880
over the stream

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:45,520
no problem so i went out to

00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:48,880
modules.raku.org and searched for audio

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,840
and got nothing

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,279
uh one thing i would probably suggest is

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,000
wouldn't it be nice if it told me where

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,799
i could find

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
more help finding a module especially if

00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,520
i was a beginner

00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,279
maybe i'm searching the wrong keywords

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,720
maybe there's a module everyone knows is

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,720
out there but i don't

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,279
then i went to pearl i said okay let's

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,320
do it in cpan

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:15,360
and well

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,120
nope uh

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,039
nothing there although it did at least

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,080
suggest a pointer on where i might look

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,120
which is

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,279
great but or similar things didn't seem

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,559
to be in there

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,840
so being that this is our raku and pearl

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,520
conference

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,520
what about maybe our friends

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,159
sure enough there we go first response

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,600
it's it's already programmed i don't

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,039
have to write the bindings i'm thinking

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,279
this is good because this is a simple

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:47,200
application

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,320
does it work on my operating systems

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,840
yeah it does

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,320
so okay maybe my preferred language is

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,799
raku but if i can't do it in raku i'll

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,559
find a way to do it in a language that

00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,840
that that that's still a nice language

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,399
to use

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,720
so well i coded this up as a traffic

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,480
light

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,399
type of application where i could see it

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,320
out of the corner of my eye

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,600
uh and that worked great for what i

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,159
thought it would but that's where the

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,000
iteration starts to come in

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,159
is i realized oh i want to know if my

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,399
pitch is going up or down sometimes

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,840
what's it doing what if i had a

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,120
real-time graph and that goes back to

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,880
that very first

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,840
example i show on the iphone uh

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,360
but i didn't want that i still wanted to

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,039
be able to catch it out of my peripheral

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,960
vision

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:38,080
uh i didn't want to do cross-platform

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,480
guise

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,000
i've done that i don't like it it's not

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,679
not my skill

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,960
and i didn't want to do a browser app

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,279
again not my skill

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,320
so okay maybe i i still want this in

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,360
some kind of graph

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,360
in a text interface

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,039
sometimes i figured i wanted to know

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,440
exactly what pitch i was

00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,640
at maybe i was try i was actually

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,120
wanting to use it for training sometimes

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,039
i discovered that it too picked up all

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,880
kinds of background noise

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:12,000
and i realized real quickly i don't care

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,720
that my air conditioner is 60 hertz

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,240
so i wanted some filters in it so if the

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,360
voice was outside this voice pass

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,440
band then didn't it ignored it

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,399
and i also determined oh what about

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,760
silence

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,440
i don't care about silence i just want

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,799
to know the last thing i heard when it

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,840
when i was speaking

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,840
what was the pitch

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,760
so i came up with the graph and i've got

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,600
some labels on it

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,679
but essentially adds lines at the bottom

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,840
it scrolls off the top

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,279
uh has a time stamp on there just so i

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,519
can see that it's doing something

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,840
has the pitch and then on the right side

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,559
is this is this graph

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,440
well i say i wanted my exact pitch

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,799
indicated

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,799
there we go and then the graph

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,399
i can see my most recent sample was

00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,080
maybe lower than i want

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,840
but previously i i was in this good

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,039
range

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,960
and i i drew two guidelines to help me

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,600
the red one was at 160 hertz the lower

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,279
frequency the green one was 180 hertz

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,120
i can see okay if i'm right to the green

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,279
that's that's where i want to be

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,720
and this lets me see how the voice

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,760
changes over

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:23,279
over time i also

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,519
made sure to highlight these and i'll

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,039
get to that in a second

00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,840
so i still wanted that traffic light

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,559
concept so that's why i use the black

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,159
background

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,760
for the for the good because it wouldn't

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,440
draw my attention

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,880
and then i used yellow and red which

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,559
would draw my attention even out of the

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,039
corner of my eye just put this window up

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,919
on the

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,919
corner of my screen

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,519
so would this work for everyone and of

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,880
course not because that's that's

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,720
that we're talking about knowing your

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,000
user

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,840
what if someone wanted to lower their

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,440
voice well it would be

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,790
exactly the opposite problem

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,519
but it could be solved the same way

00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,799
[Music]

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,799
someone might want to keep their pitch

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,280
within a range

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,639
uh again the color blindness issue

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,280
although maybe a little less with this

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,480
because it

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,480
used inverse text on the red and

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,399
normal text on the green so someone with

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,919
color blindness could still

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,480
differentiate those uh certainly some

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,159
users

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,679
wouldn't want a cli application

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,079
it looks like it's straight out of the

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,720
mainframe era it kind of is

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,399
uh but that but knowing the user i did

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,000
want that

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,079
uh if i want to share my screen i only

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,599
had one screen that could be a problem

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,200
this might not be the right solution

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:45,679
because it's going to send a lot of

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,679
screen updates across that connection

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,159
there's a ton of other voice uh

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,440
characteristics people might train

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,040
and this only looks at this one and then

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,399
the other problem is what if you're in a

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,599
noisy environment what if i worked in a

00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,119
call center

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,880
well i don't want it picking up my

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,200
neighbor's voice

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,560
and my other neighbor's voice so that

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,640
could be

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,920
that that could be a different solution

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,599
maybe i have to have a special

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,160
microphone or something to that's very

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,160
directional

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,520
as you can see i iterated through this

00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:16,800
application

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,320
because i did the traffic light first

00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,839
that didn't quite work i almost threw

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,839
the traffic light away but didn't quite

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,079
and then the third script is what i'll

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,240
call a busy indicator

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,440
this is the working from home problem i

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,359
i've been working for

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,960
home my entire time with this current

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,000
company

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,359
and that's great but

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,119
there's different interruptions when

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,520
you're working from home

00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,720
i share a house with my wife that's not

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,079
a problem

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,920
uh but sometimes it's okay

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,280
to be interrupted sometimes maybe i want

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,640
to signal

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,839
that this is not a great time to

00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,000
interrupt if it can wait

00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,240
uh equally there my wife doesn't want to

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,119
appear on video unexpectedly

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,720
so she wants to know i'm broadcasting

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,560
and then i want this to be automatic

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,640
because if i have to think about it

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,560
going back to my neurodivergence i'm not

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,680
going to remember to turn something on i

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,680
don't need a switch i flip

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,400
so i started defining the solution and

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,839
i'll go through these kind of step by

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,000
step

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,440
the first thing i decided is okay i need

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,040
some like indicator

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,480
light like you have in a radio station

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,200
it says on air

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,320
that's that's really what i need and it

00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,320
has to work with linux

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,640
so i asked the amazing itc staff at my

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,920
work i said hey

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,599
if i'm trying to build something have

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,960
you ever heard of anything like this

00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,359
they pointed me in this direction this

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,119
is a

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:52,240
luxe 4 flag this is a wireless one

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:55,760
so it has a usb wireless dongle

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:58,880
and then this can mount outside

00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,560
my door uh on magnets on the wall

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,520
and it's got a big battery underneath

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,359
and on top this that's lit up red

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,960
that's an rgb light so it could be any

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,520
rgb color

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,920
uh what's not shown here is the dongle

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,440
also lights up kind of as a repeater

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,359
showing you what the other lights lit as

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,800
so that looked like the perfect hardware

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,240
that looked like great hardware

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,760
i didn't have to drill any holes they

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,800
have to run wires perfect

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,880
so how do i drive a usb device because i

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,280
didn't know how to do that

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,040
and there wasn't really a lot of linux

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,400
applications to drive this that i could

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,920
find

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,400
found a little bit but none of them did

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,400
exactly what i wanted

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,839
so i knew raku is a great choice for

00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,560
computerized duct tape

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,280
and i just happened to see travis

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,440
gibson's

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,320
amazing presentation last year on how to

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,960
drive

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,760
usb devices uh which is basically

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,040
bindings for

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,680
lib usb in raku so

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,119
perfect that that that stuff's done i

00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,760
still had some gotchas

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,200
what commands do i need to drive this

00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,720
thing i don't know how to drive it

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,680
well fortunately there was a python

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,359
script out there that did drive it

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,720
so i was able to the commands out

00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,079
of that python script real easy it's a

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,119
real simple protocol

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,359
as you would expect there is a couple

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,000
other gotchas like i had to fight with

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,520
uh with the device management linux

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,320
because linux want to grab it and assign

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,200
it to an

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,800
rgb device that didn't work so i had to

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,480
do a few other things to get it to work

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,920
but we'll skip over those

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,280
the next problem is i wanted to

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,720
integrate with my calendar

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,359
so if i was in a meeting even if i

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,920
wasn't on on video maybe i'm on audio

00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,839
maybe

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,960
i'm doing something else i still want to

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,760
indicate that i'm busy

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,320
there's a ubuntu it's in the ubuntu

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,760
package

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,960
system utility on linux called gcal

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,400
cli which is google calendar command

00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,760
line interface

00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,359
it you create an oauth token for it once

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,880
that's created that's very easy it's all

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,200
done through the browser

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,160
uh then you have this command line tool

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,760
that can

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,640
access a calendar and in this case it's

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,520
displaying

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,240
tab separated values my meetings for the

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,160
day

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,160
perfect that's exactly what i need i can

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,599
consume that in raku because it's very

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,640
easy call an external

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,240
script and execute it i'm not going to

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,839
write all of the

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,839
google calendar api

00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,359
then i wanted it to turn on when the

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,359
webcam was in use

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:42,640
so sure enough there's a way to do this

00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,079
i can look at proc modules i can look

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,520
for

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,440
ubc video and that third field is a

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,960
reference counter

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,640
so if it's zero nothing's using the

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,359
camera if it's one something's using the

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,119
camera

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,520
but reading a file that's trivial in

00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,960
raku

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,200
and then i want it controlled by the

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,079
terminal like everything else if you

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,200
haven't seen a theme

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,319
i like the command line interface so

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,800
i came up with the command line

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,400
interface it's it outputs

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,800
current state and updates it every

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,200
minute or when something changes

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,720
and accepts key inputs just single key

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,000
characters like for instance if i want

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,839
to turn the light off

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
when i'm in the middle of meeting i can

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:25,200
hit o and it turns light off

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,960
for o for off honest b

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,119
for busy all right so i iterated on this

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,480
design a little bit

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,920
what if i want the luxifier on a

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,599
different computer than the camera the

00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,440
camera's on my work computer

00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,880
the luxifier i want it on something

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,200
that's always on

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,560
never disconnected so i wanted it on a

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,599
little uh vm

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,480
uh sitting in the corner so

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,920
that meant network support and i also

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,440
wanted to be able to control it from the

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,640
other

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,640
computer so

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,119
how do i do that well that's network two

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,560
and then can it remind me of meetings

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,720
because then i won't be late to the

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,480
meetings i'll remember and remember i

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,640
had this little

00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,480
repeater light on this usb and i later

00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,680
did it with a wired

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,920
luxophor flag just under the monitor uh

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,280
but essentially i turned the light on

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,240
two minutes before the meeting

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,240
then i get reminded

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,400
so the basic design of the application

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,880
was

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,480
a main thread that listens to a raku

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,040
channel raku channel is just something

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,680
you

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,160
feed it feed it input the it's it's a

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,680
pipe

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,760
comes out the other end multiple things

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,079
can feed at input and that thing that

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,480
reads

00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,760
on the end will just get them all uh

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,040
just pull pull the

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,760
the requests off the channel uh that

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,560
channel

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,839
did the output and controlled the light

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,000
uh

00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,880
the other threads did all the other work

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,839
because just doing this in

00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,560
multi-threaded

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,000
so much easier than trying to build an

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,160
event loop

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,599
so i had one thread that once a minute

00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,119
just sent a tick so it would update the

00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,560
screen and send tick to the main thread

00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,200
the main thread and get it

00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,079
and update the screen or add the new

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,000
line

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,079
uh another thread fetched updates

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,400
periodically from google calendar

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,000
another thread read the keyboard another

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,839
thread watch the

00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,720
camera and another thread monitored the

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,960
network

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,520
so this is an example of one of those

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,520
threads look like

00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,040
it's a simple uh simple thread

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,119
there's not much to this it looks more

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,359
complicated than it is

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,880
but that's the entirety of the network

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,520
piece

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,359
is three lines of code uh i open a

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,880
socket

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:41,760
and then i have a react block with it

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,680
whenever in raku

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,920
that every time i receive something

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,440
pass it to this variable v and then i

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,119
can

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,880
this rest of the code is just glue code

00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,560
that processes that appropriately

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,319
whenever it gets something that's camera

00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,040
on or camera off

00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,319
by udp no security here i trust my home

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,200
network though

00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:04,319
uh i mean worst they could do is turn my

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,680
light on

00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,960
uh is i i basically filter out

00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,560
duplicates because the

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,560
camera application running on that

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,079
computer with the camera every second it

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,000
was just sending this information camera

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,440
on camera off camera on camera on camera

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,160
on camera off

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,520
so i didn't want the duplicates and then

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,560
i said i wanted it to be remotely

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,200
controllable

00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,920
so there we go if it sends key and then

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,240
a

00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,440
single character that's just like i

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,040
typed it at the keyboard

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,800
and again it just sends it across the

00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,800
channel to the main program

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,000
so putting it all together

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,760
at default i don't have a meeting yet

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,200
it's 17 10

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:48,800
uh 5 10 p.m and

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,800
it just tells me what my next meeting is

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,119
at 17 11 though i started off the camera

00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,160
and the system recognizes that turn the

00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,079
light on

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,520
and also you can see it's all inverse

00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:05,760
red text that means the light's red

00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,200
i closed the camera at 17 1205

00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,599
and so it went back to just telling me

00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,280
my next meeting

00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,040
then remember i said two minutes before

00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,359
the meeting it starts up and it alerts

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,880
me by turning red again

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:22,000
so my meeting started at

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,920
17 16 though i i decided

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,119
i could be interrupted or maybe the

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,240
meeting's over

00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,160
so i sent the off command they just just

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,680
let her oh

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,920
it turned the indicator off until the

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,560
next meeting and it's smart enough to

00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,000
know

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,839
oh if there's a new meeting it needs to

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,599
turn back on

00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,359
and sure enough at 1720 there was

00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,960
another meeting scheduled

00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,200
so it turned on two minutes ahead of

00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,200
time

00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,760
some lessons i learned in this well it

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,359
was linux only

00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,560
and maybe it would have been nice if it

00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,920
supported some other operating systems

00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,720
i still wonder if there's some better

00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,160
ways of sending context to myself

00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,119
than what i'm doing with a with a

00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,520
separate uh window i actually have the

00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,200
application displayed on a monitor up

00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,720
into my right

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,640
all by itself just a little little

00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,440
monitor i had but i wonder if there's a

00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,319
better way of doing this

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,680
i also learned i hate wireless and i

00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,240
already knew that

00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:23,359
but dealing with this wireless dongle

00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,359
kind of reinforced that

00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,119
so kind of as a recap

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,240
you have to know your user and the

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,240
problem space that they're in

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,079
in the entire problem space and it that

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,599
that's difficult

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,440
so that's where you get the iteration

00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,520
and sometimes you have to throw the

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,119
wrong solution away

00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,800
the traffic light came up with voice

00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,560
training yeah that was the wrong

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,400
solution need to be a more complicated

00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,480
application as it turned out

00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,480
i didn't know that at first but now i do

00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,839
so do people have any questions here

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:20,160
the cost on it i want to say

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:29,440
it wasn't cheap for the wireless one

00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:31,200
yeah i'd say closer to 100 than 10.

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,280
but i'm sure there's cheaper solutions i

00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,480
just that happened to be the easy

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,560
solution

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,040
looks like there's a forty dollar one on

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,560
on amazon that's bluetooth

00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,200
not really the same as what you were

00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:46,560
doing there you go

00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,319
and i have a i have a

00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,640
whole blog entry and i'll i'll put it in

00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:53,280
the wiki along with the slides of more

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,520
details about this application

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,040
there's a question that's asked have you

00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,480
tried using inline python instead of

00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,880
python

00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,040
yes and i failed at it i couldn't get

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:11,839
inline python to work

00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:11,839
um so i i gave up on that

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,560
how long did i spend on them the

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,480
that's hard to know because of the

00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,160
iteration cycle

00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,440
uh and some of them i'm still iterating

00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,640
on like the router command line

00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,680
colorization every once in a while i

00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,119
tune that

00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,040
but i'd say i spent that the router

00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,200
command line tool

00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,559
i probably spent 20 or 30 hours on i

00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,960
would guess

00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,880
uh the pitch monitor that one was a

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,880
pretty quick one

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,800
so that one i i would say five to ten

00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,359
hours probably

00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,800
uh in the busy indicator that one

00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,960
probably was the biggest

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,440
one uh where i've probably spent

00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,119
probably spent a full time week or more

00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,640
writing that application but it makes my

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,280
life so much better now and

00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,440
i enjoy writing software on my weekends

00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,440
so

00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,440
well thank you everyone and i will put

00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,800
things

00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,880
on there and somebody said i'm surprised

00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,240
we didn't see your foot warmer yes that

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,520
that's another application

00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:15,040
i it's it's the module's actually in

00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:17,599
uh the raku module index uploaded cpan

00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,280
if you need a way keep your feet warm uh

00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,280
what it does it figures out how many

00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,599
cpus your computer has

00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,280
and then spins them all in a tight loop

00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,320
so your feet will stay warm if you get

00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,469
cold

00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,469
