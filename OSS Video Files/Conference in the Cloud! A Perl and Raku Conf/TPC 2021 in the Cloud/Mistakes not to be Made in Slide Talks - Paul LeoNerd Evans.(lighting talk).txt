hello um so uh this is a talk that i

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,680
first did actually in uh 2017

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,920
uh in london but i'm doing it again

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,840
because um there's a few updates for

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,920
for the new web-based way of doing

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,000
things so these are some mistakes

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,000
not to making talk slides because i've

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,800
seen i've seen quite a number of talk

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,320
slides

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,840
some of them very good some of them very

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,680
bad some of them in between

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,680
um so i thought i'd just point out a few

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,000
things that you shouldn't do

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,720
so first of all uh as a brief personal

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,960
introduction

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,360
i was born in 1982. i started doing a

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,719
lot of programming on the bbc micro

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,440
um i learned basic on the bbc micro i i

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,879
then did

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,920
pascal and and moved on to c

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,039
um i had a job doing pearl and c on

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,120
solaris

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,160
um and in summary you don't actually

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,000
care um

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,760
it's a for a personal introduction

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,800
especially in a lightning talk you want

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,039
to be brief

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,719
you want to just say here is my name

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,520
here's my cpan id

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,359
maybe an email address maybe a twitter

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,280
maybe a web page something like that but

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,000
don't don't go into huge details

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,040
especially not nearby

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,760
now fonts and colors yay let's have lots

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,280
of colors

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,960
um i don't know about anyone else but

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,159
that yellow hardly shows up on my

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,720
monitor at all

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,759
um highlights are good they really screw

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,240
with the uh

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,000
the video compression algorithms um

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,759
fonts are great for making things

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,960
terribly unreadable as well

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,920
yeah no don't don't do that just stick

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,960
to one or two

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,960
very simple styles um

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,320
feel free to put in a small amount of

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,640
styles for effect but

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,079
you know don't go overboard um

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,040
especially don't try to use

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,399
color alone to convey information uh be

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,360
aware of the there are going to be a lot

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,960
of colorblind

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,920
people in the audience so try to make it

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,720
try to make it uh readable even if you

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,520
can't see the colors

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,759
now for a background uh let's have some

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,119
nice pretty colors there look at that

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,799
um i i actually had to put the the

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,719
text background on that because i

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,040
literally could not read the writing

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,319
against all those trees there

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,800
um and yeah i i suspect

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,800
zoom in particular is probably having a

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,560
great time of this

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,720
um don't do that don't do that just

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,879
stick to a nice simple background

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,920
nice and subtle if you want you can put

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,160
your company logo

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,680
in the top or the bottom of the screen

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,319
uh i am using an off-white

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,239
uh a very slightly off-white background

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,959
i'm just watching the cop the chat here

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,920
as well

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,959
yes uh it just stops the the bright

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,879
glare there

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,560
um so you can just uh you can just

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,800
focus on that without it burning your

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,120
eyes out uh now all

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,840
the videos doing a hell of a job with

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,040
this

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,040
all the slide transitions yay

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,000
so uh let's see where's it gonna come

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,400
where's it gonna come where's it gonna

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
come

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,680
uh and there it is yeah don't do that

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,560
especially on uh a web conference like

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,360
this because

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,200
i i i i i'm not watching the video

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,640
stream so i have no idea how well that

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,519
compressed but i don't think that went

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,879
very well

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,000
avoid moving things definitely avoid

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,440
flashing things

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,239
just simple simple switches oh this one

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,159
i know is not rendering look at that so

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,319
the top of the text is cut off there the

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,800
bottom of the text is cut off there yeah

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,440
don't

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,239
don't do that right stick to the middle

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,440
of the screen

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,680
don't go near the edges

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,879
now lovely huge walls of text i see lots

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,560
of people doing this because if you have

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,080
a giant paragraph of texture default

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,599
reaction is going to be to stop and to

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,360
read it out loud and you will face the

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,560
slide and read it out instead of looking

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,000
at the camera and by

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,159
this point the audience have got bored

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,920
listening to my boring monotonous voice

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,959
droning on and on and they're probably

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,640
reading they've probably read to the

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,480
bottom yeah don't do that

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,239
right short snappy points

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,000
if you don't need real sentences you'll

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,959
notice i'm not using sentences

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,840
i don't have false stops this is a talk

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,840
it's not a reading

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,239
similarly huge walls of code like that i

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,879
mean let's let let's have a look down

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,319
here is that line 12 or line 13 yeah no

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,400
don't don't do that

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,680
a few short lines of code align all the

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,760
unimportant details

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,880
just put dot dots in there right that

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,199
code won't compile

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,120
but the humans reading the code are not

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,240
perl compilers they don't need to see

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,240
every little detail

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,880
if you put up code in other languages um

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,639
for example this one here i'm sorry it

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,680
needs the comments

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,400
um yeah don't don't do that don't

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
presume

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,360
that people are familiar with other

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,160
languages programming languages natural

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,520
languages

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,199
take extra time to explain things

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,639
uh incidentally that piece of code that

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,400
you saw that was the round setup for an

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,000
md5 digest

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,560
written in apl with comments in

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,639
esperanto and yes there is a font

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,040
that supports apl and esperanto it took

00:04:52,639 --> 00:05:00,720
me a while to find

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,720
um don't just prohibit things right

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,280
suggest alternatives

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,520
you'll see that's what i'm doing here

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:14,720
and uh

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,720
sorry i appear to be out of time

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,440
that was ironic yeah that was pretty

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,440
hilarious actually

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,840
that was brilliant especially the last

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,840
part

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,160
carefully coordinated and

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,680
to make it really sad i actually gone

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,919
get 504

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:41,120
so oh you really did almost hit the time

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,120
