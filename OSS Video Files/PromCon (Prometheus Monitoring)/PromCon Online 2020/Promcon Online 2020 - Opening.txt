00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:27,240
we I chose something with animation I

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,900
hope you like it

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:37,269
welcome to prom Khan online 2020 it's in

00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:40,300
a right there is beautiful weather in

00:00:37,269 --> 00:00:42,339
Vancouver today and why while creating

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:46,690
this intro talk I was actually watching

00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:49,120
Vancouver through a webcam and it was

00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,409
painful to not be there for some reason

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,809
we couldn't make it will actually kill

00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:54,790
him he's also here he couldn't make it

00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:56,519
cause he lives there but no one else

00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:01,540
really good for for some weird reason

00:00:56,519 --> 00:01:03,670
that reason being yeah so last year I

00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,979
talked about mental health about burnout

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,869
and alluded to how soul-crushing life

00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:10,080
destroying all of this can be and for

00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:12,640
everyone who asked before after during

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,170
thank you it's better thank you for

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,600
asking and if you have anyone in your

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:21,369
life who or something which well am I

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,620
talking about mental health again well a

00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:26,260
it's super important especially in our

00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,900
field and also especially during this

00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,790
time because everything is on fire and

00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:35,440
everything is on fire at the same time

00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:38,980
and it's not good it's just not good

00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,980
so yes it's it's okay to feel bad it's

00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:45,220
okay to feel sad and it's a fail okay to

00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:48,700
feel scared there's a few things you can

00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:51,159
do help those around you talk to others

00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,220
about how you feel and and reach out to

00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,930
them about it and above all fellow and

00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:00,520
follow best current scientific advice

00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:03,700
and know all the naysayers I hope I hope

00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:08,619
I hope that I can see a lot of you next

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:11,379
year in person so running a normal event

00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:13,810
is completely different and speaking

00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:18,340
into into my laptop and desktop feels

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:22,390
super weird to be honest but there are

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:25,180
downsides there are upsides we have

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:28,230
already identified a few upsides it's

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:32,230
more intrusive of course it's free like

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:34,760
there is we don't have any

00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,440
any ticketing fees or anything you don't

00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,599
have to pay for travel you don't have to

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,069
pay for for hotel you don't have to pay

00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,890
for anything you can just sit at home

00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:45,530
and you and listen to stuff and there's

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:49,100
less travel which again is a cost factor

00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:51,890
but also it's a effective for the

00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,260
environment and we will talk about how

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:57,080
we can maybe leverage online events in

00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,390
the future and we are very keen from on

00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,540
hearing from you more on that later

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,790
so yeah there's also downsides it's

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,980
harder to block time we saw this

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,410
ourselves in in virtual off sites and

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,810
such if you're traveling you're gone and

00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,640
everyone accepts that you're gone if

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,530
you're on a trail it can even be hard to

00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,360
stay on this half hour before and after

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:22,810
to just mentally be compressed and

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:25,819
actually go into the conference and it's

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,049
just yeah it's just not good but it is

00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:28,819
what it is and we have to acknowledge

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:32,000
this and we have to work with what we

00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:35,150
have but yet make an actual effort in

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,730
this and also in other things too to

00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,350
block time there's less incentive for

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,239
speakers to follow through of course

00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,790
again they didn't book travel or hotel

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,340
they don't they know there won't be an

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:50,030
empty stage where people are sitting in

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,280
a room so it's easier to just walk back

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,570
on on submittals and that's something

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,480
which we also need to learn as

00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,489
organizers it's harder to focus of

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,380
course there is lag there is our you see

00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:02,090
there might be you phone you might be

00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,359
watching something on the side you might

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,010
be working it's a lot easier cause to

00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:09,109
just get lost cause you don't have this

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:12,140
social pressure and I can only encourage

00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:15,140
you to do not fall for that pressure and

00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,090
there is no Holloway trick but we will

00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,430
try and make do with virtual hallway

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,610
tricks which will be running throughout

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,900
the event and also after the event

00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:27,020
and make the best of what we have and

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:31,010
see how it goes we have some immediate

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,720
lines if you want to be in a room you

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,210
kind of depend and there not being a

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,280
global pandemic and if you're online you

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:41,240
depend on the video packet not being on

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,190
fire if you follow Twitter we had some

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,050
last minute issues but the technicians

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,909
came through and everything is working

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,650
fully as of right now which is super

00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:50,720
nice and I want to give a shout out to

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:54,379
everyone who put in all the work to make

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,190
all of this happen thank you we really

00:04:54,379 --> 00:05:00,590
really appreciate this there is other

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,300
immediate learnings online events still

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,460
incur costs like for example for the

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:08,150
platform for the people running this et

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,159
CPC ET CPP the people who are on Team

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,930
are doing this in their free time or

00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:13,610
maybe they're sponsored by their work

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,289
but the other people are actually

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,159
working and does their day job so

00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:22,280
obviously they should get paid and also

00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:25,219
we will have hopefully next year in on

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,050
sediment in Vancouver and since the f

00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:28,759
managed to postpone but not canceled

00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,229
that when you which is good course the

00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,150
venue is super nice and we should be

00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:36,139
there but still all of this interest

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:38,479
cost so thank you to the people who who

00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:42,319
sponsored or who agreed to sponsor next

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,030
year and I basically already listed as

00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,930
sponsors for this year for running cost

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,310
for this year and also for for next year

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,810
and you're also seeing the slide which

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:55,909
took me the most direct course that's

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:58,159
the one downside of large boomer so if

00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:59,900
anything goes wrong during this event

00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:01,789
please look into the announcement talk

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,210
more on it later and on Twitter at

00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:07,610
Twitter and cone IO promises I will have

00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:10,310
all the up-to-date information on how to

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:13,310
recoup if anything breaks but hopefully

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,199
not we will send out a questionnaire at

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,029
the end and we would love to hear what

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,310
you think especially around the whole

00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:21,289
online experience and if it was useful

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,090
if it was less useful what was different

00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:24,710
we really really want to hear from you

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,669
of course that's something we can learn

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,900
from we have our announcement talk this

00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:32,620
is linked on pumpkin

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,750
IO and also it's linked in the upper

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:38,090
banner thingy of the video platform so

00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,550
anything breaks anything changes that's

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,379
the other the other channel to basically

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,650
keep in touch a new group if we need to

00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:47,569
review the lightning talks are still

00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,580
open and you should absolutely write

00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:51,469
yourself in and submit lightning talks

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:55,279
there's a link in the announcement

00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:57,139
talked we do follow the CTF code of

00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,440
conduct and that means we don't only

00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:00,930
hold it in spirit

00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,960
we also enforce it ruthlessly if need be

00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,820
but as we hope that as per usual your

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,280
excellent to each other we hope that we

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,290
don't need to enforce it if we need to

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,390
enforce it there's contact information

00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,460
in the announcement dock for for you to

00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,810
reach out if you feel unsafe or if

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:21,210
anything bad is happening

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:23,910
please reach out to us also maybe we can

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:28,290
just have a pro hashbrown con channel on

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:32,460
skin tears like right now yes else I
