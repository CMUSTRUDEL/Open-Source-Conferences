Description: 
	The TSDB is the beating heart of any instance of Prometheus; it is the storage engine that lets users efficiently store and query billions of data points. However, getting the best out of the TSDB is non-trivial and easy to get wrong.

In this beginner-focused talk Ian will introduce the TSDB, examine its main components, and explain how each piece fits together. We will walk through the lifecycle of a sample, from storage to compaction and retrieval. In this journey we will cover: blocks, chunks, wals, series churn, cardinality, inverted indexes andâ€¦ gorillas?
