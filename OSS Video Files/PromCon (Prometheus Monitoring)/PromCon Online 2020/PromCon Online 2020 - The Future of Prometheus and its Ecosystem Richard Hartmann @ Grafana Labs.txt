Description: 
	The Future of Prometheus and its Ecosystem, Richard "RichiH" Hartmann @
Grafana Labs

Prometheus has taken the world by storm and continues to make inroads into new fields. We will be talking about the near and long-term future of Prometheus, and how it will continue to shape the ecosystem around itself.

[Music]

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,400
hey all right welcome back

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,160
uh we're now going to hear from richie h

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,880
about the future of the prometheus in

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,880
the ecosystem

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,180
brian roll the clip yeah

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,280
does actually me we're doing this live

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,480
[Laughter]

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,600
um so yeah oh no live

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,840
oh yes let's see if that one works

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
so welcome to the future of prometheus

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,680
let's start with a quick recap

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,960
of what happened since since the last

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,559
program

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,559
for 2.14 the highlight feature was

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,320
definitely the react ui

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,320
it's still experimental and it hasn't

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,199
reached feature parity yet

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,439
but it's slowly getting there and if you

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,720
have a promises which is 2.14 or new

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,560
which you should have

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,080
you'll find a small thing in the upper

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,920
right which lets you try the new

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:19,200
based ui and it's super nice for 2.15

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,159
we have the metadata api

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,159
we have exposed or supported help type

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,080
and such information for ages within

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,320
permissive exposition format but

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,320
we haven't really done anything with it

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,680
so now we have an api for externalizing

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,640
this kind of data

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,920
and here you can see the graphana

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,439
explore ui

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,360
taking taking advantage of this

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,119
to show the user what they're actually

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,399
looking at and just giving more context

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,280
about what they're currently building

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,880
what they're currently

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,799
digging down into 2.16 was mostly about

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,640
improvements and stability

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,640
if i had to if i had to highlight two

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,240
things it would probably be time zone

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,079
support for anyone who's not working in

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,280
utc you can just set your time zone

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,439
locally

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,600
and also there is the query log which is

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,000
a feature request from 2016

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,000
so it's nice to finally have a tick mark

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,319
next to that one

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,280
speaking about really old stuff um

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,800
isolation

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,480
the eye in isothesis in asic databases

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,959
and fun fact if you remember that

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,040
particular slide from from just now from

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,800
garner stock that's because both him and

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,239
we stole it from gotham

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,120
so acetate eats acid stands for

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,760
atomicity

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
consistency isolation durability and

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,800
it's super nice to finally have

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,440
isolation

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,720
2.18 was mainly about tracing maximum

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,879
flowers

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,200
within prometheus and thus obviously

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,200
also cortex and thanos

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,040
and you can now really drill down into

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,000
into stuff but also you have example

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,080
support

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,440
and for those who don't know who don't

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,920
know german jaeger

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,959
or jaeger in german means hunter a

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,200
hunter who's literally looking at traces

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,159
as to why that hunter is hunting humans

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,360
i don't know

00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:06,640
2.19 ram ram ram memory

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,760
this is insane going from

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,760
up to above 30 like 33

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,560
down to maybe 16 ish that's 50

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,480
optimization and on the one hand it's

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,120
it's super nice to see that we have

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,720
that kind of potential within with

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,400
information still it's also somewhat

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,440
scary to be honest

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,280
if you look at those two or blocks of

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,480
stuff rising on the left-hand side you

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,560
might be able to guess

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,920
where that optimization was what's

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,239
happening

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,319
2.20 when preparing this talk i

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,120
mentioned how this was a slowest release

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,000
and i was

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,680
absolutely wrong as julian noted this is

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,080
the longest changelog since 2.6

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,239
but what's even more important than we

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,720
that the fact that we support two random

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,360
storage

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,879
uh service discovery mechanisms it's

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,879
that we are uncrusting parts of

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,040
prometheus and taking a fresh look at

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,159
many old decisions many old consensus

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,319
positions

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,280
because frankly the world has changed

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,879
and arguably we changed the world

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,879
and we need to need to take this into

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,760
account here and in other places so

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,319
we're just

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,280
starting to to ease up on a few things

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,360
which we

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,799
which we held stronger opinions on in

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,479
the past

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,479
last thing in the look back node

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,680
exporter is finally 1.0

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:27,360
and it has the ls6 tls export

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,520
support which is marked as experimental

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,520
and cncf is sponsoring yet another or

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,520
the second review by qr53

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,199
off of a thing in the prometheus

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,080
ecosystem the first one was focused on

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,240
prometheus

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,479
this one is focused on tls within node

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,360
exporter and node exporter as a general

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,520
thing

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,199
initial results are looking pretty good

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,960
and obviously we'll be publishing the

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,240
report in full we will

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,520
probably get that report next monday was

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,360
the initial promise it might be a little

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,520
bit later we'll see but when once we

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,680
have it we'll publish it

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,080
so pivoting to to looking into the

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,080
future

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,880
there is a thing sometimes i do get the

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,600
feeling that we as

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,919
a project are resting on our laurels and

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,759
i

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,840
honestly don't like it some time ago i

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,479
started a grafana internal brainstorming

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,560
document

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,520
with the title prometheus is not feature

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,919
complete

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,199
and i also asked redhead to do the same

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,560
we took those

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,080
threw them together into a large

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,160
brainstorming document through them and

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,320
prometheus team mailing list

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,919
and now this is a document where we can

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,160
discuss and brainstorm about

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,440
all the things and this is already

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,560
bearing food

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,880
and as soon as topics are

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,160
are mature enough to actually be

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,520
discussed

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,360
they are broken into dev summit

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,720
discussion points

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,680
which brings us to the deaf summit

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,560
obviously covet made things a little bit

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,120
icky for us

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,880
as well um because we couldn't have an

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,720
in-person thing which we would normally

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,720
have be having right after prom con and

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,000
ideally also during prom con

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,560
europe which is what we did last year to

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,039
two summits so we have a solution

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,039
shorter more often and virtual

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,000
and instead of doing one or two full

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,400
days of death summitting at once

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,080
we're now doing four hour blocks the

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,639
first one was last friday

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,000
the next one will be early august and

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,720
we'll basically keep doing

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,400
them until our backlog is empty but we

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,000
still have quite a bit of backlog and we

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,360
keep adding more and more

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,840
here the permissions is not a feature

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,479
complete thing so i want to do

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,800
two things now first i want to walk you

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,319
through what we agreed upon

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,720
and also just fyi that is structured

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,720
in a way which is basically like we we

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,160
collect stuff then we vote upon stuff

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,000
what we care about

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,680
and what has the most votes is discussed

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,880
first so this also gives you a

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,880
indication about

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,240
what we within team care about the most

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,759
because that's the order we'll be going

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,360
through

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,880
but this also brings us to the next

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,080
point

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,479
i want to share a little bit of

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,400
background of how i run those meetings

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,960
and what the underlying considerations

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,720
are i would probably also write a blog

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,800
post or two about this thing because

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,919
that's a request i've been hearing a lot

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,960
recently

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,440
writing or externalizing how to actually

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,039
run

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,840
things like this and how you can find

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,840
consensus how you can how you can enable

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,520
a group to to have a good and healthy

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,520
discussion why not why not shutting

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,080
anywhere down or anything

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:30,400
so without much further ado metadata

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,520
metadata again is starting to be useful

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,800
in prometheus

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,039
see the 2.15 thing um but

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,680
we need to do more especially propagated

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,440
through the remote read write api

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,360
there's also lots of interesting

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,039
questions around what

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,120
what to do with metadata when you

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,400
persist it especially when it changes

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,960
when it flaps

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,479
like if you have changes are you storing

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,080
every single change which basically

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,039
turns you into an event storage

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,440
or are you maybe i know are you limiting

00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,599
to

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,919
only every 10 minutes are you limiting

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,160
to just the first one possible

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,160
past the pause the last metadata

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,680
metadata you saw

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,440
all of those are considerations which

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,919
which are not easy especially once you

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,639
take the

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,560
the second dimension of is this per time

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,520
series parametric name parametric name

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,759
and target

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,000
it becomes icky fast and it's

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,400
non-trivial to come up with a thing

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,759
which

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,800
tends to do what what users want

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,160
want to have but there's also something

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,160
not obvious here if you look at the

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,919
second consensus position

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,240
merging that pr that has been sitting

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:38,080
for quite some time

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,360
um and we want to actually allow more

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,200
experimentation with intermediate proper

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,399
we are deliberately easing up a little

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,800
bit at least on

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,720
on a few things over time with

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,640
information we have started to redefine

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,839
experimental as somewhat approaching

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,160
stable

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,080
which is good on the one hand because it

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,880
just tells you what what kind of high

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,720
level

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,000
of expectations we are setting for

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,640
ourselves but

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,920
on the other hand um that impedes

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,080
innovation

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,240
so we are walking back on this one to

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,720
some extent

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,959
and we'll see it very end up but we will

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,760
probably or we will most certainly be

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,680
more willing to experiment and also

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,800
sometimes maybe even take back or change

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,080
stuff which is

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,399
experimental next

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,399
we have some janitorial workflow changes

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,640
which are not that interesting

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,760
but there is another thing um initially

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,560
we had in the

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,320
in the document which was from i think i

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,680
started this document in march so

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,839
like the for the death summit that's

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,000
preparation for kubecon u

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,240
um we had master in there and it was

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,040
changed to main uh during this left

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,200
summit

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,320
for a very simple reason we are very

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,800
serious about spiri

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,959
and spearheading this verbiage cleanup

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,320
it's admittedly not the most important

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,320
thing which we could be doing but this

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,680
is something which we can do and so we

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,120
are doing this

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,880
for making the actual changes in the

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,800
code we are waiting for github and

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,200
others to provide more tooling first and

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,600
foremost actually agree on a thing

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,240
like most of the most likely main as a

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,959
name but

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,959
we just don't know for certain hopefully

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,040
maybe git can also get the act together

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,920
and change the name

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,720
and also ideally i would like to have

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,560
this run

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,880
this actually doing through community

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,839
bridge not just within prometheus but in

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,839
all of the cnf

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,839
and cncf projects maybe even in all of

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,920
the linux foundation projects

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,880
because this is a quite nice thing it

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,120
has an

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,959
insane amount of touch points for a lot

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,399
of projects you get in touch with a lot

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,680
of people a lot of different tooling a

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,160
lot of different projects a lot of

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,399
different working styles

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,000
so this is perfect for someone trying to

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,680
break into the scene

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,600
and hopefully hopefully this will work

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,880
out i'm already in conversation with

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,680
priyanka and chris a

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,560
about about how we could structure this

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,519
so

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,800
we'll keep you posted next one is super

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,240
nice as well

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,519
backfilling and yes filling backfilling

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,519
in prometheus proper

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,680
i can probably hear the people spit

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,839
their coffee at their screens right now

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,360
um but also admittedly it's a very

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,000
contentious topic which is why it took

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,920
us so long to agree on on this one

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,200
so the first one is kind of obvious yeah

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,160
we will have we will support

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,600
uh permissive exposition formic and also

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,120
open metrics obviously

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,560
um and one csv or tsv

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,399
format which is well defined for

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,079
importing data okay that was relatively

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,440
quick like not super quick but else was

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,760
relatively quick

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,519
but then how to do this over the network

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,079
if to do it at all

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,800
and that's again very very interesting

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,680
from the

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,720
from the dev summit point of view

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,640
because

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,320
the first the first consensus point

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,079
you're seeing in the second block

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,680
we want to support backfilling over the

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,959
network wire blocks

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,920
which do not overlap with the head block

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,639
is something which i've been rewriting

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,560
rewriting

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,480
several times over during the discussion

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,320
and just trying to nail down

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:08,000
when we have a potential a potential

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,560
thing we can actually find consensus on

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,680
and the initial reaction was more or

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,959
less well let's

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,480
finish this discussion then i i kind of

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,240
tried to to keep people back a little

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,600
bit and said okay now let's let's make a

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,079
consensus here

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,000
and we we word smith a little bit more

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,279
and then we actually had this this one

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,800
consensus position

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,959
and that was written down and we knew

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,279
what the others accepted

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,079
and we could base the next work on this

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,160
and after

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,760
quite a bit of back and forth it was

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,160
kind of obvious that we would

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,519
not want to or at least not find a

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,279
consensus position

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,279
on supporting backfilling over the

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,839
network via streams

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,760
which do not overlap with the headlock

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,760
but this was also a result and as much

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,480
as was a non-result but still it was a

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,480
result

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,920
so we wrote this down and actually had

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,959
this as a call for non-consensus

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,360
and knew what the others actually

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,680
thought and agreed upon and that is what

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,800
allowed us to find the third point

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,680
that we would like to support

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,079
backfilling over the network wire blocks

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,480
which do overlap with the head block

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,360
given proper design

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,320
and every single one of these words are

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,160
word smith

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,040
to the extreme of course this is the

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,800
precise extent of the consensus we could

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,560
find

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,000
and and doing this in this in the

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,839
step-by-step

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,360
way allowed us to actually find this

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,519
consensus versus just

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,160
postponing the point as we as we did in

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,920
the past

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,800
one rendering in my opinion

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,079
go carries a lot of baggage of of

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,680
basically

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,320
designers being used to having a

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,639
monorepo where all the

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,600
immense code base of of a certain

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,760
corporation

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,279
is living in one huge humongous

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,199
repository

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,199
so they don't face a few challenges of

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,240
the actual railroad

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,320
and vendor is a prime example of this so

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,160
the content position is simple we'll

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,279
remove it in node exporter we'll see if

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,639
we like it

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,480
but the funny thing here or the

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,440
interesting thing from the from the dev

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,440
summit point of view

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,440
it was obvious pretty much at the

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,240
beginning of the discussion that we

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,560
would find consensus on precisely this

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,480
we would try and remove it it would be

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,079
ben who would be volunteering

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,959
and we would be trying this in node

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,959
exporter first and seeing what explodes

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,720
because that's what we always do and

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,279
that's also what i wrote down at the

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,480
beginning

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,480
of that discussion and i think most

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,560
people didn't know this

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,240
and there was a discussion for quite

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,600
some time about all this stuff and i

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,839
just let it run and didn't mention it

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,519
and

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,519
in the end i called for consensus and it

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,680
was consensus was found

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,959
but the funny thing here or the

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,760
important thing here is

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,720
um by allowing people to just talk about

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,639
it and just

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,560
talk it through and think it through at

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,560
their own pace

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,399
we were actually able to find a

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,639
consensus position in just

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,320
instead of me just suggesting something

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,360
and ramming it through

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,079
um which actually allowed people to

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,360
to to come to this conclusion on their

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,000
own whereas

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,720
if it was just presented they wouldn't

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,360
have felt as good about this

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,680
next one is also janitorial as you

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,560
probably know china blocks google

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,240
and we will adapt our documentation to

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,040
make it easier for chinese users to

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,040
participate

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,560
if you use this email address that

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,600
actually works i tried it

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,600
some time ago and that means you don't

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,600
have to rely on the web interface of

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
google to subscribe to our mailing list

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,040
we can make this part of the

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,839
documentation the other thing is

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,680
genitalia

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,199
stuff around our c channels and

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,880
obviously xkcd-1782 applies

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,560
there was a ton of bike shedding about

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,600
everyone's favorite

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,519
instant messenger and indian irc one so

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,759
yeah

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,680
next one is something which is very very

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,120
dear to my heart

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,480
it's documentation i said this during

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,880
the dev summit and i

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,040
absolutely mean it the first thing which

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,600
i did dislike about prometheus and what

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,240
made me

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,639
almost walk back from it was the

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,800
documentation or the non-existent

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,240
non-existence of documentation we have a

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,600
reference but we don't have

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,639
proper human friendly human consumable

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,399
documentation and also especially if you

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,480
don't already roughly know what you're

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,480
doing it's just a valley of pain to walk

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,000
through

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,440
so the consensus position is is

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,720
super nice like it's it's it's just

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,639
great

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,000
we will restructure our complete

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,720
documentation

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,680
the user manual which will be new is the

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,360
default

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,920
it's the thing which will be shown if

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,680
you just navigate to our site

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,440
there will be a lower threshold for

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,839
contribution

00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,320
and this actually carries full examples

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,560
explanations of underlying concepts

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,360
things which you can just copy and paste

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,360
paste

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,199
completely and have a somewhat running

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,760
conflict to to just get you started with

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,319
all these nice things

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,919
sorry next the reference is what we

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,559
currently have

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,319
and we might even start removing stuff

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,679
from the reference and putting it into

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,559
the manual and then just start

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,280
crosslinking

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,839
to to make the reference even leaner and

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,679
meaner if you just want the reference

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,240
and then expand the user guides and

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,360
tutorials preferably on a kind of choose

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,039
your own adventure thing

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,559
um i'll probably write a design document

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,280
about this one

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,760
so we can we can we can have lego bricks

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,520
of

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,320
of tutorials and design of guides

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,320
diana peyton co-worker from grafana labs

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,280
is the one who will be asking for his

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,000
style she order

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,440
already wrote a few things like also an

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,480
overall concept and such for the

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,760
documentation

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,720
so we have a good tech writery approach

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,000
to

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,240
to actually doing this and we will

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,840
really try to not break any links but if

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,520
it makes sense we'll do so and

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,320
potentially redirect you can read all of

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,000
this yourself

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,000
and you don't have to you don't have to

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,960
frantically write down that url

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,720
um this will be merged um basically

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,200
during the q a

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,039
um it's already public and we'll we'll

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,240
just link it during the q a and then you

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,080
can read it yourself but

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,360
i would suggest you you join the q a and

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,880
you join the breakout sessions and you

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,000
watch lightning talks and then you

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,200
actually read the test summit notes

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,480
next we come to the ecosystem

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,320
first everyone gets an exporter

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,760
so there are thousands of exporters

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,080
worldwide

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,160
and we want to to focus on metrics not

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,160
on writing http or new https servers

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,400
so there's no toolkit it's not finished

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,280
yet but it's already pretty nice

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,720
and and helpful and this allows you to

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,840
to write exporters in

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,600
easier way to just speed up writing

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,840
exporters of course there are thousands

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,000
and thousands of exporters but

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,480
getting more data into prometheus means

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,960
more exporters so have at it

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,520
also not just in in prometheus also for

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,360
example in cortex and thanos

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,880
which are obviously the siblings of

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,320
prometheus and they wouldn't exist

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,640
without prometheus

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,200
and they do cover use cases which are

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,600
completely out of scope for prometheus

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,640
yet we obviously have a huge container

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,840
overlap between

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,559
between the three projects both of those

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,640
projects

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,080
are moving from sandbox to incubation

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,960
stage within cncf

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,840
at least that's my hope they passed the

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,559
review and due diligence within sick

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,960
observability

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,960
they pass the toc technical oversight

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,559
committee due diligence

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,160
and are now in the public comment phase

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,919
so if you're subscribed to the tlc

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,039
mailing list you can you can comment on

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,679
this

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,080
and once this period closes there will

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,799
be a

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,400
formal vote by the toc and everyone can

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,360
can load plus one or minus one

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,640
non-binding if they want to

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,360
so i was talking about sick

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,159
observability what is that

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,159
there is a new second tone and now that

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,640
we're done with the action items which

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,360
are

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,000
basically handed directly to us from coc

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,280
as in due diligence or review of cortex

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,760
and thanos

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,600
we're free to do some some stuff which

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,960
we want to do or which

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,120
we also want to do let's say one of them

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,799
best current practice documents so we

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,480
probably focus on metrics and metric

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,080
naming and considerations about when to

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,880
use a counter when you use the gauge and

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,799
such first

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,960
and this will partially mean just

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,080
copying stuff over from from prometheus

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,720
obviously

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,240
but basically also how to how to run a

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,600
system how to instrument the system a

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,520
lot of things of just

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,440
how should you be doing all this stuff

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,360
how should you be using it

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,520
the other thing which we'll be looking

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,000
at is data analysis and we are currently

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,200
defining use cases for data analysis and

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,679
then we'll move further

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,280
once once we have all the use cases gone

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,200
you're more than welcome to join us

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,480
we have a call every second tuesday at

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,960
1600 utc

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,919
there is a mailing list there is a slack

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,760
channel

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:10,000
and there is lots of friendly faces who

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,000
will welcome new friendly faces

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,559
next open metrics and yes i know this is

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,200
a long

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,120
topic someone asked if if we would

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,440
finally be done by 2030 and i made the

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,480
joke that we would be done by 2031 due

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,600
to covet

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,760
but actually we are making good progress

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,880
on typing up this close document which

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,880
has pages upon pages upon pages of text

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,280
into something which is actually concise

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,200
and can be considered a standard

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,720
but this was basically needed to do it

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,520
this way so that's what we're currently

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,360
doing

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,760
but we're already seeing benefits from

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,960
this we're already seeing

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,080
vendors and and companies committing to

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,480
this

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,039
even though it's not fully published but

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,440
also exemplars and prometheus and thus

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,280
cortex and thanos are a direct result of

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,400
openmetrics if we hadn't done this

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,679
within

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,480
open metrics prometheus wouldn't support

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,799
examples plain and simple also i joined

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,559
the

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:11,120
open telemetry course we are on track to

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,880
be a first-class exposition format of

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,039
open telemetry

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,080
i dare say or i hope that for me

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,559
experience and

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,159
also those years of open metrics

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,480
discussions proved useful to open

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,600
telemetry in some points because i was

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,200
just able to say okay

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,039
we looked at this and these were the

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,480
arguments these for the pros the cons

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,640
this is what we came up with on the

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,000
other hand not wanting to trample over

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:37,760
over over what work

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,320
had been done before and

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,760
now we come to lasting also related to

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,799
openmetrics

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,799
when i started openmetrics in 2016 i

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,880
wanted to tackle matrix logs traces in

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,360
this order

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,280
and the the intention behind openmetrics

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,880
was always to also have the other thing

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,200
which is part of why

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,400
why the github arc is called open

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,280
observability

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,799
and not open metrics there have been

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,520
many discussions in the background over

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,760
the years

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,840
and i'm probably super excited to see

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,679
loki take shape behind the scenes and

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,760
are also front and center

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,679
of course now you have something where

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,320
metrics and logs have the same data

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,320
model

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,679
for accessing your data so this means

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,679
you can jump seamlessly

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,600
from your graphs to your events and back

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,159
to your graphs and speaking of graphs

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,720
from events next version of loki will

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,000
support

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,320
extracting metrics directly from

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,159
from your logs with with running queries

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,039
on the on the side

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,559
but there is another aspect to the echo

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,039
system

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,039
and in tech we tend to take the view

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,520
that political politics should be kept

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,600
out

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,440
and in my opinion this is fundamentally

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,840
wrong

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,480
open source is a fundamentally political

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,200
movement

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,720
it's literally a thing to change society

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,720
to create equality and freedom

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,120
and and people not seeing the need to

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,520
address all those concerns

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,840
is a fundamental misunderstanding of

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,840
society of privilege

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,159
so if if you feel uncomfortable hearing

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:19,840
black lives matter

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:19,840
congratulations your target audience

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,640
thanks richie so i have to ask

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,400
how do you how much do you love about

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,960
your new presentation software

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,919
uh it's horrible i've been working with

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,480
with google

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,360
with google slides quite a bit recently

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,039
um

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,279
ever since joining grafana and i

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,360
hate every single minute of it latex

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,279
beamer is so much more efficient and so

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,120
much better in every single regard other

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,240
than putting graphics and animated gifs

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,360
in

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,039
um the workflow of of creating and

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,120
rearranging your train of thought and

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,919
finding this

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,760
this this story through what you're

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,640
actually talking is so much easier to

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,120
restructure

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,640
with uh with lovetech and also quite

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,760
honestly you don't have to care about

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,640
all the formatting bits

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,559
because it just happens i'm actually

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,279
considering to make to make someone

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,080
write a

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,679
beamer template which follows the

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,240
profana

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,240
style for reasons

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,080
all right uh questions from the q a uh

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,760
the

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,039
i i assume this is about the prometheus

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,400
binaries flags are half of the

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,320
configuration

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,600
uh but you can't find them on the web uh

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,679
are we going to include them in the

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,279
documentation will the documentation

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,039
show differences in the flags across

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,279
versions

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,400
uh sorry come again with the first part

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,880
of what you said

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,080
uh the prometheus binaries flags are

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,080
half of the configuration

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,960
and but they're not uh they're not

00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,640
include the flag

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,360
the the flags are not included in the

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,360
documentation

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,799
um i wasn't aware of this but uh given

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,440
the state of our documentation i'm not

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,440
surprised

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,679
um and yes they should absolutely be

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,000
part of our documentation

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,039
and yes version documentation is part of

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,679
the plan that

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,480
we basically always show show latest but

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:23,279
you can walk back to older versions

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,520
where we are talking with cncf about

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:28,559
restructuring

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,919
stuff and and yeah

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,559
and something which you might even be

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,960
trying is to to also keep the

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,039
upcoming documentation in git and on the

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,760
page but not show it by default but just

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,960
like have

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,039
better of next version whatever um as a

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,279
thing which you can also view on the

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,240
on the web as a secondary point the

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,799
discussion about

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,000
what should be in a file versus what

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,799
should be

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,919
as a command line flag is also ongoing

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,000
and that's part of

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,240
of what's on the roadmap for the

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,240
difference

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,520
uh next question up uh if the ban on

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,039
on something is up uh we could see the

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,279
future that flags can be provided with

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,840
environment variables

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,200
uh i i believe that the question is is

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,520
uh have we unbanned

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,679
environment variables uh from being used

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,679
instead of flags

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:24,559
actually i don't

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,399
i don't think we have and there is a

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:30,399
very good case to be made for it is

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:33,440
not to be made scores by and large

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,080
um environment variables and and and

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,559
flags

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,960
are pretty much the same thing they're

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,159
coming from the same direction

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,919
speaking of of how to invoke a thing

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,679
um yes i know there's differences and

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,480
yes i've been running linux on my

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:52,880
on my desktop for for 20 years now so um

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,640
i i know where where this ask is coming

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,640
from but i'm not convinced that it's

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,640
that it's worth the extra complexity and

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,840
i don't think it's a consensus position

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,360
with improvement system either

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,919
funny to note that uh in the 2.18

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,760
release

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,200
the only way that you can configure

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,399
jaeger is by

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,640
enabling environment variables so which

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,840
is

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,080
an exception and that broke a lot of

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,520
users

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,279
because they add the environment

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,120
variables flying around

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,399
and it's funny that for one thing that

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:31,840
we enable with

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:31,840
environment variable it breaks the users

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,799
i have a question uh

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,080
you should uh definitely check out uh

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,399
yeah uh

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,600
i just put him in amd

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,000
slides in markdown sounds like a good

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,799
idea

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,360
sounds nice but but latte is even nicer

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,080
but

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,919
uh the problem is it doesn't allow

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,799
others to steal from your slides and as

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,640
we saw with both ganesh and my talk

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,279
being able to steal from gauthin saved

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,200
me easily 30 seconds of slide creation

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,640
maybe even two minutes so that's also

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:13,840
something to keep in mind

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,840
but i'll i'll check out kodi thank you

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:19,440
so anything on slack

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:30,320
there is a question about m mapping

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,559
i think i'll just hand that one off to

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,399
probably brian or i mean julius and ben

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,000
you're also fine if you if you want to

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:40,080
answer it but

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,960
i'm not the best person to answer this

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,960
who wants to jump in

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,080
question about emma i think that i think

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,840
that was a uh

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:55,039
a question from the previous talk oh

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,679
oh oh oh oh i'm way i'm way i'm way back

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,520
in slack

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,520
sorry sorry sorry sorry i

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,600
okay yes it's from the previous talk

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,840
thank you mathias

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,840
we should play some heavy metal as

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,919
yeah but matthias makes a good point

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,159
that environment variables are often

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:20,399
considered globals and globals are evil

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:23,039
by default like i get how they can make

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,200
a program seem easier at first but long

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,200
term they're just the liability

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,960
unless you're programming rpg for in

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,640
which case there is a good use case for

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,039
them for flow control but

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:37,840
with digress any other questions

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,279
uh i have a i have a statement on the

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,559
configuration of flags

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,480
versus uh config file

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,760
and and how and why we do it the way we

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,960
do it uh we've

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,399
had this long-standing policy that the

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,240
everything that goes into the config

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,840
file should be something that prometheus

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,519
can dynamically reload

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,440
so um and the and we use the flags as

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,240
things that are can't be reloaded

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,200
uh there's no objection to moving things

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,440
that are flags

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,120
into the config file but we need to

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,080
change the code so that they are

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,600
reloadable

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,440
and there are a number of things that

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,600
are flags right now that

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,799
actually should be reloadable like

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,200
retention why is

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,640
why does why is uh retention time and

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,559
retention size

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,240
need to be a flag well we just haven't

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,519
made it a reloadable

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,919
dynamic feature and i would love to see

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,640
retention be in the config file so that

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,640
users who are

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,000
running out of storage can easily just

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,960
deploy a new config

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,279
and reload without having to restart for

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,919
as a simple example

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,799
but somebody has to do that code pr is

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,200
welcome

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,000
yes and and tacking on course there was

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,600
a comment in

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,120
in slack i'll just read it out some

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,679
context if you run prometheus with

00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,519
systemd

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,200
it will be easier to provide flag values

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,880
and environment variables

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,320
and now let's keep that one then i'll

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,120
also answer that after

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,200
uh it will be easier to provide flex

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,480
flags values as environment variables on

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,640
a configurable environment

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,880
instead of modifying existing service

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,159
units

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,720
yes that is true on the other hand

00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,760
i mean hate systemd or hated both is

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,159
valid um

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,880
but the point is um it has a nice

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,880
property

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,480
which um which is it has a descriptive

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,480
language for actively

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,399
for actually dealing with stuff whereas

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,039
before you had imperative style

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,399
and and scripts and such so it's a lot

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,360
easier to deal with

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:36,480
certain with certain aspects of of just

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,919
handling your system

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,080
and in my opinion

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,720
this actually goes a little bit against

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,320
the intention of systemd2 to basically

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,039
shoehorn

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,159
shoehorn environment variables under a

00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:54,080
thing instead of

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,640
properly modifying the the unit files

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,640
but ben's point is valid stuff which

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,519
should be configurable at runtime

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,919
should absolutely be in in the config

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,240
file

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,480
so you can actually do this without

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,840
needing to reload without losing that

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,799
that short part of your of your

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,799
of your storage

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,799
uh and yes what he has i said hate or

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,080
hate on purpose

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:23,039
so um any plans for to continue virtual

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,039
prom con in the future

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,360
on the one hand having a virtual prom

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,320
con

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,279
is super nice because it it is a lot

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,720
cheaper to run

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:37,200
and it is a lot cheaper to attend

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,120
which is obviously super nice and it's

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,480
it's more inclusive of course it means

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,919
it means people who couldn't attend

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,880
beforehand can now all of a sudden

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,519
attend

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,120
it means um people don't need to travel

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,159
so you don't have any co2

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,039
co2 it also means

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,799
that people aren't forced to to be there

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:58,000
both the audience and the speakers

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,760
and the speakers um some of them walked

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,919
back on prior commitments i

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,519
i suspect at least part of this was just

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,279
like there was no flight book there was

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,279
a hotel book they knew there wasn't an

00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,359
empty stage

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,960
and people would think hey why is that

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,720
stage empty

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,839
um also attendance can be harder to

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,839
actually make time for

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,960
and just as a data point we currently

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,480
have 81

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,359
participants in this call whereas

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,520
the projection for a in-person event was

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,760
around each 600 people

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,599
we sold out to work 20 before every

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,560
single time

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:39,280
so there would be more life audience

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,960
um who actually focuses and pays

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,040
attention instead of being distracted by

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,280
other things like ben currently is

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:50,240
um i can see on the video i can see this

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,760
yeah i'm managing questions yeah but

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,639
there's also other nice stuff like for

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,639
example um

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,159
managing questions is a lot easier and

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,320
discussing stuff

00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,920
while that talk is ongoing is a lot

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,400
easier

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,200
if i have to guess i would say we would

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,560
probably

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,400
ex like covet will will keep for some

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,400
time and we'll do a postmortem for this

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,400
one and i would like to have a second

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,520
virtual program this year

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,000
uh as to next year we will see and we

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,160
will also

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,680
depend on the feedback from people and

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,119
again we will be sending out a survey

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,599
please answer the survey blah blah blah

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,880
blah

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,640
yeah we'll really experiment and see

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,760
where we go but i don't think we have an

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,839
actual answer but

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,839
i think we will continue to experiment

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,280
um

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,520
yeah can we have both online and live

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,480
prom cons in the future yes that's

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,839
precisely the point

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,400
maybe we can maybe we can't we'll see

00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:48,800
that's the honest answer

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,320
there is less need for an online thing

00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,839
if you can meet in person and the

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,440
hallway track is admittedly better like

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,800
the breakout sessions after are super

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,240
nice and you should definitely come and

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,520
join and try this

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,880
but being able to sit down and talk as

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,119
humans

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,119
conveys a lot more a lot more context

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,960
we'll see

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:15,280
yeah online isn't as bad as i expected

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,240
but it makes for long working days and

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,160
can overlap with

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,599
working hours for many people yes that

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,359
is precisely the point

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,280
it's harder to block this because if you

00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,079
travel you travel and you're not there

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,599
same as if you're at work no one in your

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,599
family or so will

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,359
interrupt you because you're not there

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,320
if you're at home people just assume

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,320
you're there you have time

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,400
usually if you travel you'll not be

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,640
you'll not be

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,839
bothered but if you're sitting there

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,520
working uh

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,359
even getting that half hour before to

00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,920
just decompress and focus on on the

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,720
thing

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,640
can be hard because it's super easy to

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,079
be distracted and it's also just

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,599
people will distract you a lot more

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,280
easily because they can just walk in on

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,800
you and they just expect you to keep

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,680
working

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,160
and obviously between emea and us and

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,240
also

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,240
asia to be honest it's it's hard to find

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,160
a time zone which works which means for

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,480
india it tends to be in evenings for

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,720
the us it tends to be in the mornings

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,560
and asia is just

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,000
uh well at night that's not as much of a

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,520
problem if you have an in person because

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,440
people need to travel and so they adapt

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,960
to a little time zone it's more of an

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,280
issue or it's more

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,280
visible of an issue if you do online so

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,359
hybrid conference yes um both with my

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,040
foster head on and with my congress head

00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,680
on that's something which can work but

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,599
it's super hard to actually make work

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,760
like monitoring certain channels and

00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,680
such to to relay questions from the

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,240
audience is something we already tried

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,640
and

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,359
which we'll probably also try and expand

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,320
and maybe have a dedicated designated

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,119
thing

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,440
to talk in during during during a live

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,560
streaming and such

00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,200
yeah it's not as easy and

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,640
the thing about in person is in person

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,560
tends to disregard

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,880
the online presence of course it's just

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,800
so much more easier to do in person

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,720
that people just naturally switch over

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,640
completely to the person so it's really

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,560
hard like also just reading out all the

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,760
questions and not just answering without

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,520
giving others

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,160
the context of what i'm actually

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,440
replying to is already something which

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,960
is not natural it's a learned habit from

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,560
from doing video work at foster and

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:32,079
hating the people who didn't do it

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:34,560
or not typing

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,400
um can you elaborate a bit what

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,880
prometheus feature incomplete actually

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,400
means

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,760
lts from ql web ui all of this and more

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,880
um i considered to to make a

00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,280
little bit of of what's in the document

00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,839
visible during this talk and i

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,240
deliberately decided not to

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,040
of course this would be unfair to

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,240
pre-end

00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,400
discussion i don't want to to create any

00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,480
any public expectations or anything so

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,839
basically what's in that document is a

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:09,119
secret within within prometheus teamwork

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,560
and once we just start discussing this

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,359
in the dev summit and then we reach

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,040
consensus

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,800
or we don't reach consensus but still

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,480
write it down

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,400
then we will start externalizing this

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,880
but not before because this would this

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,480
would

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,240
like we we discussed this during the

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,359
deaf summit course bartek

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,480
ran a survey on what should be

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:31,359
a backfilling interface on twitter

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,920
and frederick reigns raised a very fair

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,640
point

00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,640
that this actually created a kind of

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,320
expectation slash mindset

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,000
slash framing in which that we would be

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,480
supporting backfilling is already

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,440
more or less a foregone conclusion and

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,040
that's just not

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,599
fair to the overall discussion in

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,400
consensus building so i'm deliberately

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,000
not

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,839
talking about anything which is not

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,839
public

00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,839
and it's not public for a reason

00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,880
are we counting this as a north american

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,960
event

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,400
now we renamed it to online and removed

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,560
the vancouver thing

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,319
on purpose like we even have we even

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,000
removed the picture on purpose

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,680
but we know that it'll be in vancouver

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,720
next year of course um that's

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,720
that's when um

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,800
that's that's basically the venue

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,160
allowed to postpone but not to actually

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,839
cancel so for

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,200
certain reasons also because vancouver

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,240
is super awesome

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,000
um that'll be the next one in person

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,280
conference would be definitely

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,480
exciting to attend yes and one thing

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,200
which we are very much aiming

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,720
for with with prom con is to to maintain

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,400
this family wipe anyone who ever

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,200
attended will probably

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,760
attest to this that it feels like a

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,400
gathering

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,000
of friends not so much like a tech

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,359
conference and this is something

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,880
which is quite hard and intricate

00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:02,000
to make work but it can be made to work

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,920
and and the result

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,960
just makes all the effort more than

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,400
wealth one so yes once we have in person

00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,200
again you should absolutely

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,200
try and attend

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,680
what's the best place to propose get

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,280
involved in things like metadata topics

00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,880
github issues yes github issues like

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,319
again this is part of uncrossing

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,240
prometheus as a whole

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:29,440
somewhere in between the mailing list

00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,839
and and github issues

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,720
we might also start experimenting with

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,760
public

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,920
design documents more we will see but

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,200
this is one of the areas which which i

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,200
think we need to improve upon

00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,960
any other questions also i think i'm way

00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,640
over time

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,760
but that's another nice thing about the

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,760
about the virtual stuff

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,960
yeah we're actually 10 minutes over time

00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,880
um guess we should go into lightning

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,720
talks

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,040
um yes okay can i first thank you richie

00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,520
but

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,280
also brian julius ben and the promotive

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,680
team for organizing this

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,960
but we should also thank katie from the

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,680
cncf and all

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,200
his team to deal with this virtual event

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,240
and also getting the physical

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,520
event moved on so this was not easy it

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,440
was a lot of work

00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,359
i also want to thank the speakers who

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,079
took the time to prepare the

00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,720
conference in that strange times and

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,359
also

00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,440
lucas from kikochat for helping us with

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:41,599
that platform and

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,599
assisting us in the conference as well

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,839
and i have probably forgotten many

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,560
people and we thank everyone who made

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,560
this possible

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,599
so one one person vanessa herrick also

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,040
from cncf

00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,440
um i think that covers most of it yeah

00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,359
and

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,200
the one thing which i usually do during

00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:04,000
the during the in person

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,119
um is to get everyone literally everyone

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,200
on stage at the end

00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,119
and that is also the plan for after the

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,480
lightning talks that everyone just

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,040
basically switches on the video and

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:26,880
waves it to the camera and

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:28,960
shares a round of virtual applause

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,960
