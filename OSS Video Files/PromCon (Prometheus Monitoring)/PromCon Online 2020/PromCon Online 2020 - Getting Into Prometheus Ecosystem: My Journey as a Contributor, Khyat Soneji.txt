00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,359
in this presentation i will be sharing

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,279
my experience

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,520
of how to get started with contributing

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,880
to promoters

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,199
i would like to thank the prompt

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,000
organizers for giving me the chance to

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,480
present

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,400
and but i can videos who have been my

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,079
maintenance for the project and have

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,079
helped me prepare the progressive graph

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,640
before i get started with the

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,120
presentation i would like to address the

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,200
tough time that we are currently facing

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,480
in the current world where we have been

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,559
seeing big layoffs

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,160
and when we have been isolated from our

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,160
friends and family

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,039
i would request all of you to please pay

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,719
close attention to your mental health

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,719
you should reach out to the people who

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,000
are close to you if you feel that you

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,800
have been facing any mental

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,559
issues feel free to reach out to me if

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,439
you want to talk to someone

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,720
you can reach out to me on my twitter my

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,720
twitter handle is scatter341

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,840
but that out of the way let's get

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,840
started with the presentation

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,159
starting with the outline in this

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,200
presentation i will be covering a short

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,439
introduction about

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,479
me my inspiration for getting into

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,159
communities

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,360
how to get started contributing to

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,920
prometheus community

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,680
my learnings from the project and how to

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,560
manage the stress and difficulties

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,240
associated with it

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,320
and i'm currently a computer science

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,320
student based out of india

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,520
a main motivation for being in computer

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,520
science to me

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,880
is to build products that help people

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,399
around the world

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,399
starting from the first year of my

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,040
college i started contributing to open

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,040
source

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,479
and i feel very happy when people were

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,560
using the products that i have

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,320
contributed to

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,159
i'm a contributor to weekly education

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,079
dashboard

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,680
which is a tool used by students and

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,079
occur other academics

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,600
to improve wikipedia i am also

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,239
contributed to thanos

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,080
which is a highly available chromosome

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,480
with a long term storage

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,840
about which i will be talking during my

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,080
presentation

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,680
apart from that i also write about my

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,640
learnings and internship

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,400
on media i have also been mentor for

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,800
wiki education dashboard

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,000
through outreaching media where i help

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,400
underrepresented

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,920
societies contribute to open source

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,920
talking about my inspiration to

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,599
contribute to contribute to

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,599
chromophysical system

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,959
i came to know about promotes from my

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,800
elder brother

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,800
he is also complete he is also a

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,640
software developer and has a permissive

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,120
sticker on the back of his method

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,840
which is the only sticker on his method

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,560
he explained to me

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,280
how prometheus is an important ecosystem

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,040
important monitoring ecosystem of cloud

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,120
native applications

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,239
usually the biggest step for starting

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,959
with the contribution

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,640
and i'm sure that all of you most of you

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,159
would

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,640
relate to it is the very first step

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,000
thus i would request all of you that

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,480
when you read or hear

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,920
about things that excite you to learn

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,319
more

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,319
please take the first step so that you

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,239
would know more about the project

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,159
my first step for getting started with

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,440
the contribution was to start watching

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,239
the theta deposit

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,239
in which cnc has listed all its project

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,760
my my main motivation was to contribute

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,840
to the project that is used by thousands

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,080
of developers around the world

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,200
it would be a great opportunity to learn

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,080
go go and other related technologies

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,760
it was because of my first step that i

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,799
got

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,879
that i got a main notification about

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,799
community bridge internship

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,000
held by cnco i decided to apply for

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,720
thailand

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,560
in which i was selected as an intern the

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,920
detail about the application process

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,080
were very straightforward

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,480
and i have mentioned them in my blog i

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,239
will not be able to go through it

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,280
during my presentation so i would

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:17,040
request all of you to go to my blog

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,040
and look at it afterwards

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,440
talking about the project that i will be

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,440
working on

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,280
during my internship was retired

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,400
coordination between different harness

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,720
components

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,639
during my intervention time i had taken

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,360
up a course in my college

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,400
taken up a distributed systems course in

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,639
my semester

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,720
and it was an excellent opportunity to

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,560
learn about the different challenges

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,560
based in distributor system

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,320
i had a very little experience with

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,120
golovk and so i

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,960
spent quite a time learning about golem

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,479
and reading about two methods

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,199
because most of the concepts they of

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,360
thanos are based out of chrome nucleus i

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,400
decided to document my learnings of

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,639
thanos codewave project

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,240
and golem setup to which i could refer

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,440
at later point of time

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,039
for my first contribution my my mentors

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,360
bartek and gabriel

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,199
assigned me a beginner level issue which

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,960
gave me a lot of confidence

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,960
to get the hang of the code base

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,400
in this slide i want to cover very few

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,880
basic processes that i followed

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,880
during my intervention it might feel

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,800
very basic but i feel that they are very

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,280
helpful for communication

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,280
the first of which was to make sure that

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,160
all the communication between me and my

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,520
mentors

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,120
happens on public channel keeping the

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,120
doubts on public channels

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,560
would not only help people who have the

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,800
same doctor

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,360
but other community members can also

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,120
participate in the discussion

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,039
please make sure that i am not

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,680
completely dependent on my meetings for

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,759
help

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,720
i can post my doubts on the public

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,479
channel

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,639
there were many handful community

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,160
members who patiently helped me dissolve

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,440
the doubt

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,240
one one important thing to take

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,759
take care of you is to make sure that

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,840
the language of your message

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,800
seems like a request and not like a

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,039
command

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,919
remember that open source is full of

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,160
volunteers

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,319
who are taking out their time to help

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,800
you resolve your doubt

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,880
even though you might not have intended

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,639
to post the messages as a command

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,240
it might can still come up as an

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,960
authority message rather than in request

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,479
we should thus make sure before posting

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,120
the message that the language of your

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,560
message seems like a request

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,960
here i have given a given a two

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,960
slag messages the first one looks very

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
demanding like you are giving an order

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,599
to do something

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,560
and the second one seems like a request

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,280
so this looks very basic but please keep

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,280
this in mind

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,000
the second process that we had was the

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,520
weekly income session

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,360
with my mentor to discuss any bloggers

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,639
or any questions that i would have been

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,120
facing

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,039
with each session we had an upfront

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,440
agenda

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,160
on which we would be discussion in which

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,319
we which

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,919
like which helped us uh prepare for the

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,560
discussion

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,520
initially we decided to have discussion

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,080
every whole day

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,720
but later we decided to schedule it as

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,800
in when

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,840
our stuff i would like to thank my

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,479
mentors for being very flexible with the

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,360
session

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,800
here i have attached a screenshot to our

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,759
agenda discussion

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,960
here you can see the approaches to to

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,919
try out

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,160
to try out pseudocode discussions dish

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,560
concerns made etc

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,400
the link is also present in the slide

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,400
please check this after the presentation

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,120
we also decided to break the project

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,280
down into multiple individual databases

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,440
so it can be better tracked and it is

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,400
always better to look at individually

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,800
smaller

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,440
pull requesters rather than a big pull

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,560
request

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,919
involving multiple changes here i have

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,800
attached a screenshot

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,160
which is referring to one of the big

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,960
pull requests in which

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,360
the discussion grew very big that my

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,919
butt

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,520
that my mentor bartek was not able to

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,039
comment anymore on the

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,840
pr trust me you do don't want to get in

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,840
such a situation

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,680
talking about the talking about managing

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,919
the difficulties and stress associated

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,200
with the project there are many

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,360
challenges

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,959
work challenges when you're working

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,440
remotely on a project

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,880
especially related to collaboration and

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,720
coursework

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,040
there are also challenges related to

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,760
time since there are not specific

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,760
because

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,920
you don't have any specific working

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,440
hours one might be inclined towards

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,480
procrastination

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,440
i realized that working even a little

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,760
bit

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,800
working every day or even a little bit

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,279
on the project

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,560
is much better than keeping a backlog of

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,040
things to do

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,880
this was more difficult than it seemed

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,440
because i was working on the project

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,160
alongside my semester studies

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,360
there were a few weeks during which i

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,680
had my visa

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,360
and i couldn't make any contribution to

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,760
the project

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,920
i realized that it is very important to

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,720
communicate about any time related

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,640
constraints

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,120
with the meters also another thing which

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,600
is very

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,519
important is to make sure that before

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,120
you start with implementation

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,279
you are on the same page with your

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,279
mentors this will make sure that if

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,000
there are any corner pieces

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,839
that you are missing out are pointed out

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,880
early on

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,200
a good way to make sure that you take

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,880
all other scenarios into account is to

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,880
make a detailed proposal

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,040
which mentions the different approaches

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,440
to solving the problem

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,120
one should focus on learning more about

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,440
code conventions

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,560
have a good code quality and add more

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,720
testers

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,680
this makes the code movie cycle easier

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,519
for meters and

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,320
avoids going back and forth the full

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,320
requested way

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,519
overall i would like to say that it was

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
a fun experience

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,079
working on the project not only did i

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,880
learn about rolling

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,120
prometheus and the monitoring landscape

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,279
i

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,079
also came to know about the processes to

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,480
follow for collaborating remotely

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,720
i felt pride in contributing to software

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,760
used by thousands of developers around

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,640
the world

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,760
i also feel privileged to learn from my

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,720
amazing mentors

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,440
and the community members my mentors

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
have been

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,800
extremely patient and encouraging with

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,279
me

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,800
i remember my first call with them in

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,720
which they had shared their experience

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,480
share their motivation for having a

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,519
career in computer science

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,240
it was very inspiring the community

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,640
members

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,440
are also very welcoming and appreciative

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,480
of your efforts in contribution

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,279
i learned a lot from making mistakes as

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,560
well

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,959
for example i in one pull request i

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,120
didn't break it down added

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,000
into multiple individual prerequisites

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,320
the result was a huge pull request

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
in which there were 27 file changes over

00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,480
383 discussions on get up

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,839
and over 30 days of work a better

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,200
approach would have been

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,279
to break it into individual taskers so

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,279
there are some things that you learn by

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,839
making mistake

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,640
and i'm sure that i will not repent my

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,200
mistake the most

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,519
noteworthy part of my project was my

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,680
first contribution to the thanos project

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,079
this made me feel confident that i can

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,480
contribute to this project

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,160
i also will earn conversation to help

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,720
other people on their open source

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,760
funding

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,920
just like how i started by reading up

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,120
a material written by other community

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,720
members

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,639
many students from google summer of

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,519
course reached out to me thanking

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,680
for writing my blog on the internship

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,920
i would like to end my presentation with

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,560
the same emoji that i sent to thanos

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,240
channel

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,760
when bartek merged the final four

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,320
request for my internship project

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,279
this was my first time presenting at the

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,600
conference

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,519
i hope this presentation inspires other

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,120
fellow contributors to start with the

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,000
problem yes

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,519
great and we have cat here today to

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,480
answer any questions

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,240
that participants might have kat you're

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,399
welcome to turn on your video i see your

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,160
microphone is on

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,320
hello uh can you can see me now

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,320
yes excellent we can see you and we can

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,320
hear you welcome aboard

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,320
thank you um

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,000
everyone can post their doubts uh if

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,360
they have any doubts um

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,560
i'm happy to answer any of them

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,959
yes while we're waiting for some

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,519
questions to come in when you hear your

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,760
video

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,760
again do any new thoughts come to you

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,880
uh i feel that i could have done better

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,079
because this was my first presentation

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,600
i was quite nervous keeping it recorded

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:29,839
uh helped a lot but still i think there

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,120
were some points that i could have

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,800
been better about well i think you did

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,120
fantastic

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,480
so if you were so you had a chance to

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,560
record that

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,399
a few days ago and then if you were

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,079
giving that presentation today would you

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,440
have said the same things or is there

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,839
anything that you learned

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,720
since then that you would say

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,600
differently

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,199
um i guess i would have included some uh

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,720
other points too

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,279
uh because usually when people start

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,959
they are

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:03,440
uh scared that uh how can they like

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,079
when i started uh contributing to

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,279
prometheus i was very scared that

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,440
i won't be able to contribute so

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,600
i think i should have more included

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,320
about that

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,680
uh like even if uh you are not a

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,160
contributor to prometheus you can still

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,839
apply for community bridge and uh get

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,880
the chance to contribute to

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,000
any of the cnc and cncf projects

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,320
so i think i missed that

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,320
point

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,399
have you been able to collaborate with

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,440
other people

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,000
how have you found the community to be

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,800
um to be honest people are very sweet

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
they are

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,519
very helping uh they would uh

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,639
like my mentors used to spend hours

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,120
uh trying to resolve my doubts so and

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,600
uh whenever i used to post my doubts on

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,480
the slack channels people would uh

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,120
like all the community members would uh

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,839
answer

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:12,399
uh answered them and would help me

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,600
so it was excellent would you like to

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,800
tell us

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,560
would you like to tell us a little bit

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,800
more about your journey as a developer

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,880
what brought you here

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,079
in other words what were how many years

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,600
have you been developing

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,240
and what what are your the skills that

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,000
you

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:33,279
enjoy using most um

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,120
well uh i wanted to uh like i have been

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,560
contributing to open source from three

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,160
years now

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:43,360
uh i wanted to apply for room with years

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,199
uh three years back uh from when i came

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,600
to know about raw methods

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,639
but i used to feel that i don't really

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,079
have such

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,199
uh skills right now to apply

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:58,399
i mean to contribute so

00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,519
i didn't really apply back then

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,240
but uh now uh have

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,959
have done have been done to internships

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,079
i thought that i could apply for cncf

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,160
and i i

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,360
applied to community bridge we did not

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,720
require any

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:20,000
uh requirements that you have to know

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:24,160
through uh golang or any of the

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,560
uh projects so i applied and uh

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,399
turns out that when you have great

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,079
mentors you can

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:35,600
you can do it uh it just takes

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:39,040
some amount of extra time and uh

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,680
that's it thank you cat and we've got

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,680
some questions already coming in from

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,560
attendees and participants

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,959
here's one what are your future plans

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,680
with

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,680
thanos do you still get time to

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,759
contribute

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:58,639
um currently uh i do not really get such

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,759
time to contribute to thanos but i would

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,160
really like to

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,760
uh become i i would really like to

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,240
contribute more to thanos

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,679
i really want to get into the community

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,319
and uh

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,280
once i get free right now i'm busy with

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,559
the

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,240
interviews so i hope that like when i

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,919
get free i would get more time to

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,880
contribute to thanos

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,360
and maybe get in uh included in in the

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,400
community

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:32,000
excellent the next question do you think

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,840
there's a better components or an easy

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,400
path for people who want to be

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,880
contributors

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,799
i think the open source is the best way

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,840
because

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:47,120
i i myself started as an open source

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,160
so i know that it's very easy because uh

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,919
there are people out here to help you uh

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,440
like you can post your doubts you can

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,360
ask your mentors

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,200
they would help you and you have a live

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,440
system a live project that would that

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,640
would be used by thousands of people

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,280
and you would be working on that so like

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,120
this is being as a student you are still

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,559
getting to participate

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,520
and work on a real software so i think

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,919
open source is a great way to start your

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,919
journey

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,160
excellent we'll head on with the next

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,240
question we've got an additional 12

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,039
minutes for questions for cat welcoming

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,480
all questions from participants today

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,400
so the next question is what things

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,799
could open source communities do to

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,799
encourage participation from new users

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:42,080
um i

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:45,200
to be honest i'm i'm not really sure how

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,440
uh how i can uh answer that but uh

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,400
i feel that open source is already

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,760
giving

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:56,080
uh many chances to people uh many start

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,039
many uh many chances to the new uh new

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,919
contributors

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,480
uh i like the uh community bridge

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,559
approach

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,600
that uh you do not really have to

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,880
contribute

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,840
uh you just uh even if you are new

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,840
uh if you are if you just want to

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,559
contribute and

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,880
if you are even if you are not able to

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,000
uh

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:22,640
complete the project uh but

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,200
you can still be selected because uh

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,840
this is just a learning opportunity so i

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,480
feel

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,240
that even google google summer of code

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,200
or outreach you should also

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,919
follow this that like because some

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,120
students

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,320
might find it difficult uh

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,720
when they are starting off so they can

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,600
like directly be selected as an intern

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,440
and then

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,360
mentors can help them outstanding we had

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,559
a comment here from ps in the chat it

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,160
says

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,000
thank you for your contribute

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,919
contributions to thanos

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,320
and then the next question that pops up

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,880
here is from another participant if you

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,120
could change

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,240
one thing about your internship with

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,159
thanos

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,960
what would it be uh i would say that

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,360
i wish i was not doing it alongside my

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,480
uh

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,440
semester studies uh due to which uh

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,280
i was not able to give much time and uh

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,120
at the end of the project uh

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:24,320
even though i was able to uh like

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,880
complete the project i was still sad and

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,679
that i was not able to give my full time

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,720
so

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:34,559
i hope that the next time

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,760
uh i would be able to give my full time

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,440
that's it fantastic

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,679
and what are some things that you're

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,679
learning personally as a professional

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,520
right now when you have time for

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,880
self-improvement

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,440
what are you focusing on

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,600
right now i'm focusing on making my

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,200
communication skills better

00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,640
uh sometimes i kind of uh come off a

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,400
little bit strange or rude

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,520
i didn't think so i didn't think so at

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,039
all this is fantastic

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,039
and other people are agreeing in the

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,000
chat too

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:15,120
so by the way um how many languages or

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,120
dialects can you speak

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,280
um new one is only three

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,159
only three that's two more than i can so

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,679
that's fantastic

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,360
yep and you're getting more comments

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,960
exactly just like that

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,360
thank you it's amazing that we can do

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,039
this

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,400
you know we're separated by thousands of

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,360
miles and

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,360
able to be in the same conversation and

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,720
you along with all the other people

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,280
who are participating here it's a

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,520
community working together even though

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,880
possibly never getting a chance to meet

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,559
in person but

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,559
doing something that's core to each

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,400
other's day-to-day work

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,120
we have a next question coming in from

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:59,039
arthur have you had any good job offers

00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,280
after your internship uh i had one from

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,480
facebook as a production engineer

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,679
in the for intern but uh that has been

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,720
cancelled due to

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,679
uh the covet and uh

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,240
i recently have been uh interviewing

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,480
with

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,000
google and facebook for full-time

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,919
opportunity

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,120
as i will be graduating uh next year

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,880
so yeah fantastic that's a great role

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,320
model for others who can follow in your

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,919
path

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,480
so if we have any additional questions

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,840
we have another five minutes or so

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,480
so if where would you see yourself

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,280
contributing to open source in say five

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,080
years

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,640
here this is where you are now can you

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,960
imagine

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,960
where you might be in five years

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,480
uh i wish that i would be

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,480
uh like become

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,440
like maybe uh some i i want to uh

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,640
mentors others especially like i want to

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,840
become a

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,159
contributor uh then mentors others

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,520
uh like mentoring the different projects

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,400
and then

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,400
would help or inspire others to also

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,679
like inspire new students to contribute

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,480
to open source

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,960
because i myself started as an open

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,760
source

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,640
uh and from open source and i would warn

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,120
that others should also uh

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,919
contribute because this is an excellent

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,440
way to

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,120
uh update your skills uh when i started

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,679
i didn't really think

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,280
that i had any skills when i first

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,480
applied for

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,840
rj saga i was not selected and i felt

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,880
really really bad

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,520
but uh i applied anyway uh

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,679
to outreachy and i was selected and that

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,960
gave me a lot of confidence so

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,000
i would just like that i would become a

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,000
maintenance help others

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,360
that's fantastic first you think that

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,320
you don't have the skills and then

00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,840
before you know it

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,799
you're getting these job offers from

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,799
these amazing companies

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,799
yeah are there some moments

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,320
about your interactions with people in

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,960
the community or mentors

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,840
where you someone did something or said

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,799
something

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,400
that helped you in some way it gave you

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,400
the information that you needed or

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,520
inspired you

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,120
when when you think of mentors what is

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,360
most important

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,679
for you to succeed what do you want to

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,320
see from mentors

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,799
uh from mentors i would be like i want

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,679
my

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,960
uh meeting to be free to free to me like

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,840
if there are any

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,440
trouble that he or she is facing then i

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,000
would want that

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,360
that they could communicate to me uh

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,840
they could communicate they shouldn't

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,000
feel

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,240
hesitant on asking any doubts they

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,760
shouldn't feel that they are asking me

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,200
too many doubts or i am getting

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,600
irritated or anything they could uh like

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,320
message me anytime they could ask me any

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,760
doubts

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,000
so this is just uh this is a few things

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,200
that

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,159
i would uh take or take care of as

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,279
i mean a mentor that i could give much

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,919
more time

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,919
and uh be patient with my mentee

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,960
that's fantastic

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,480
see we have more and more people joining

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,679
the call here so many people are able to

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,760
hear your story

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,600
also this is going to be recorded and

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,400
distributed to many others

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,400
so it can also inspire people who were

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,320
just like you a few years ago

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,240
and help them realize that they can be

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,279
you with hard work

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,400
and dedication and an open heart

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:41,039
so a lot of other great comments here

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,240
too so i'm excited for you i didn't even

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,520
get the job offer but

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,840
i'm i'm just excited to hear that from

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,559
you

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,679
you know i i do other software but just

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,039
to hear your story

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,520
is very inspiring and i know that i felt

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,080
when i

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,279
started because i'm actually from a tire

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,760
three college

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,720
so i haven't always been scared about

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,840
the placement

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:07,039
and uh i was very scared that i have to

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,600
like i would be unemployed for an ear

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,240
and have to like beggar those could give

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,880
me

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,760
uh referrals to some companies and then

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,440
maybe i could get in any one of them

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,400
and uh like even a year back i couldn't

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,520
see myself

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:27,200
or anywhere but now

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:30,799
i can see that uh you can i can see

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,799
my future that you know i

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,240
uh i am not really much scared about

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,520
placements now

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,159
and yeah i have another question how do

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,360
you explain

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,200
open source to your family do they do

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,600
they know what you're doing or they say

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,480
cut why are you spending so much time

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,000
over there

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,000
on the computer uh no they actually

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,600
understand my brother is also a software

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,159
engineer so

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,960
uh they have already been familiar to

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,000
open source

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,799
and i didn't really have to explain it

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,919
to them they are

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,960
actually very happy uh that uh you know

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,880
i'm

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,440
they are happy that i'm already working

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,360
alongside my semester studies so

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,200
they think that i should actually spend

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,240
more time on my laptop

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,679
so yeah even if they see me on my phone

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,200
they would be like why are you not

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,320
working

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,320
you should do something

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,919
all right well we have another question

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,919
here so it's wonderful to be in a

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,640
supportive environment where your family

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,760
is encouraging you to do all that you

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,799
need to do

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,360
so here's a philosophical question

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,159
someone says do you think it is ethical

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,000
to

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,919
charge for software to charge money for

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
software

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:53,200
um yeah i mean uh there are

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
people do charge for uh their code and

00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,399
uh

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,440
like some people like to keep it uh open

00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,919
and some people

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,039
uh would like to charge for it and it's

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,300
up to them

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,440
uh and i'm even keeping it

00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:09,120
[Music]

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,240
charged i don't think so that that is uh

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,039
that is wrong in any way

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,320
it's just uh like some people think that

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,520
you know i should be

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:25,039
paid something i wrote or

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,039
like that so i can really say

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,960
excellent well thank you for sharing

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,640
your thoughts on that this is a

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,240
wide and diverse community so there are

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,960
probably many opinions and

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,399
you fearlessly shared yours and and in

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,840
the networking sessions at the end of

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,720
the day maybe this could be a topic for

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,640
discussion

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,640
so i think that let me give you a moment

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,679
to wrap up with any final thoughts and

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,240
then we'll get ready

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,480

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,919

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,679
don't be think that you are you are not

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,760
something

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,880
because when i started i really never

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,240
thought that uh

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:09,039
i would be i mean i could even get

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,640
a chance to interview for facebook or

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,520
google and i'm currently

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,080
uh into interviewing with them so this

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,360

programs in which you can participate

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,880
and many communities that would help you

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,679
