00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,800
Roman and representing with Lexi one of

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,689
the information about our company and

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,660
product we work in also percona Percona

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:28,470
is well known as a database performance

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,470
company and one of our recent project

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,410
its recommendation management tool to

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,200
help our internal and external users to

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:43,730
help them monitor and manage their

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:47,280
database installation so very short it's

00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:50,489
PMM recommended management it's open

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,520
source database system you can install

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:58,079
it on your environment and we also have

00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:02,250
this embedded ssl encryption our idea

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,670
so generally PMM it's a like a two boxes

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:09,060
of combined software pmm client and pmm

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:13,350
server and on the client side we have a

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,720
set of exporter and they're like screech

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,720
to to manage them and also there are p

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,750
announcer it's come bundled together

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,150
primitives graph another for the Gravano

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:30,299
is with the sports we prepare internally

00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:33,689
Percona to like expose some interesting

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,490
and important metrics for databases and

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:40,049
also we have the component name query

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:44,460
analytics is it sir like our our own

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:48,659
custom made product and we actually

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,030
using the MySQL insight to track some

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,689
metrics from queries from the database

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,399
so that picture can see like some

00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:57,630
insights from their query analytics

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,009
information

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:05,909
it displays and as I said it's used or

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:10,050
MySQL inside and actually for extending

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,180
for storing mode of data my skill

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,969
actually became our

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,939
problem so we're now looking at a

00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:22,980
different solution to like extend extend

00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:25,469
our product and Alexei will will tell us

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,680
some insight about future solution for

00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:30,120
us to replace my ski oh yeah so we

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,799
wanted to use parameters because they're

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,959
like let me just cradle and which it's

00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:35,790
very powerful but we have two problems

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,219
here first we have hikers and outs of

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,650
labels basically one of the label we

00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,480
have here is a Kuwaiti we still do if

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,400
you can get put in two feet we remove

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,989
parameters but still typical application

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,450
makes a lot of different queries and we

00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:50,760
also get long-term storage something

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,319
that old parameters low-cost on she

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,590
wasn't able to do for us we went it's

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,659
like months of data so we looked at

00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,969
youngest click house I don't know if

00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,739
many of you know the system is open

00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:04,500
source column within the database

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:07,950
it's it is about power Z and X Metallica

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,469
which is second biggest analytics

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,169
solution in the world of Google antics

00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:16,049
it's very fast it's helped built an

00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:18,510
application and fastening and very

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,030
efficiently we have read more about it

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,470
on this fence at Amin and before

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:28,049
plighted HR for our quite analytics so

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,120
right now we have this database so how

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:33,150
can we use it

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,510
thanks to Tom's we now have a new remote

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,810
API for primi just second so we made a

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,150
promise which is a solution for storing

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,269
data in quick house in the region and

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,150
relation data to actually push the code

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:50,459
just before the talk it's it's not

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:54,120
production-ready useful but it also

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,759
features fool Oh somebody isn't it's

00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,680
just right a little wiser code but it's

00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:03,629
all official it's slow but it works so

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,720
do not use it in production but try it

00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:08,720
try it like vomit out thank you

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:23,360
[Music]

00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,499
