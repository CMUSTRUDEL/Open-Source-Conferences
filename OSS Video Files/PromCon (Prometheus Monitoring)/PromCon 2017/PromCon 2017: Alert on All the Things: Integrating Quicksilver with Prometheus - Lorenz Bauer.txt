Title: PromCon 2017: Alert on All the Things: Integrating Quicksilver with Prometheus - Lorenz Bauer
Publication date: 2017-09-01
Playlist: PromCon 2017
Description: 
	* Abstract:

Cloudflare provides its services from 115 data centres in 57 countries. One of the most critical systems is a key-value store that replicates configuration data to every single machine, which we recently rewrote from scratch. As developers we were early adopters of Prometheus at Cloudflare, and this talk will explain how we set up Grafana dashboards for monitoring and Alertmanager for alerting, giving us unprecedented insight. Itâ€™ll also cover the gotchas we encountered. Like that one time when we triggered 7000 alerts at once.

* Speaker biography:

Lorenz Bauer works at Cloudflare, which serves a lot of today's HTTP and DNS requests. There, he's been replacing a legacy replicated database system for the last two years. His favourite number is 42.
