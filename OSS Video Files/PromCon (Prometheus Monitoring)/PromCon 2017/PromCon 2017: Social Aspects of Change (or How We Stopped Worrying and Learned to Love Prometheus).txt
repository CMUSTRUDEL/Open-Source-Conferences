Title: PromCon 2017: Social Aspects of Change (or How We Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love Prometheus)
Publication date: 2017-09-04
Playlist: PromCon 2017
Description: 
	* Abstract:

Companies are (still) run by people they need to accept the technology driving the company's business. Introducing the best of technologies will lead to nowhere unless this change is accepted at all levels of the organization. This talk will cover lessons learned when introducing Prometheus into a long-established company with many organically-grown and thus highly-fragmented systems.

* Speaker biography:

Richard Hartmann:
Currently focusing on building a new datacenter for SpaceNet, Richard comes from the networking side of things and has been on call 24/7 for over a decade in his last life. He learned the hard way that precise monitoring which supports operations is key to keeping people sane, and allowing them both sleep and a social life.
