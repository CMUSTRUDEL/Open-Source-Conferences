Title: PromCon 2017: Social Aspects of Change (or How We Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love Prometheus)
Publication date: 2017-09-04
Playlist: PromCon 2017
Description: 
	* Abstract:

Companies are (still) run by people they need to accept the technology driving the company's business. Introducing the best of technologies will lead to nowhere unless this change is accepted at all levels of the organization. This talk will cover lessons learned when introducing Prometheus into a long-established company with many organically-grown and thus highly-fragmented systems.

* Speaker biography:

Richard Hartmann:
Currently focusing on building a new datacenter for SpaceNet, Richard comes from the networking side of things and has been on call 24/7 for over a decade in his last life. He learned the hard way that precise monitoring which supports operations is key to keeping people sane, and allowing them both sleep and a social life.

[Music]

00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:18,029
I'd like to rekt welcome Richard Hartman

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,520
to talk about the social aspects of

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,859
change and if you ever need somebody to

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,869
deface your mati with something I'm

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:30,410
using lis inappropriate this is the guy

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:32,669
for the job welcome

00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,790
I'm Richard somewhat involved with

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:38,610
Prometheus and if you want to work in

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,090
the music area do let me know so some

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,950
background why is there social stuff at

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,230
a monitoring conference this sounds

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,480
weird at first but basically this is

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,879
about how you can enact change within a

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,379
company and changing the monitoring

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,750
system is one of the most fundamental

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,420
things which you can do I learned most

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,280
of this the hard way after being 11

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,010
years at the old job and pretty much

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,189
knowing everything I switch to a new job

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:08,340
and everything was new and there were a

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:11,400
lot of established systems old ones

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,409
weird ones no two teams at the same

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,600
tools or instrumentation or what have

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:21,360
you it was really really very naturally

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,549
grown to use the positive tone and most

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,840
of you will know this in in some form or

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:30,930
other when I actually am I good on the

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,560
mic okay sounds weird here upstairs but

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,750
okay so at first when when I switch

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,909
change jobs I also wanted to switch over

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,390
Foss them and tried to do it with libera

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,200
animus then really suggested I do look

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,930
at FOSDEM

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,759
sorry ed promises in between like two

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:53,399
days or three days I was a convert

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:58,460
because it's just better but you know if

00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:01,740
you want to calculate change you can't

00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,540
basically these formulas formulas might

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,020
even be valid that unless you have

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,979
proper inputs it's pretty much useless

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,250
the real thing is that the hardest

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,740
problems you have to solve

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,750
not the technical ones these are the

00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,010
social ones taking the stuff is

00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,020
relatively easy because you've got a

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,010
computer and you sit down and you hack

00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,810
at it until it's done

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,530
unless it's np-complete or something but

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:29,740
else it's it's within your means to fix

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,980
it somehow with social problems

00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,360
it's an unbounded problem there's so

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,060
many things to take into account at

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,370
every single situation will be different

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,459
with technical stuff mostly most

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,959
situations will be mostly the same ish

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:47,980
social it's all different all time or is

00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:51,520
it because there are some underlying

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:54,790
things which which I realized and

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,550
talking to people many many other people

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,530
see the same you often have incentives

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,830
within companies or projects or whatever

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,060
which run directly counter to change

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,400
developers might care about new releases

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,620
operations type people they want to have

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,410
sleep and the one who have stability so

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,720
they by their very definition of what

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,049
they get their money for they are

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,140
resistant to change and this is because

00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:23,680
change is hard unless you somehow

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:26,140
automate and well embrace change in a

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,580
way that actually works for you and for

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,010
everyone else in the company or the

00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,480
project or what have you

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,000
and there will be lots of discussions

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,739
about trade-offs because you might have

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,260
someone who tells you no I don't believe

00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,640
that this will be a positive change or

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,280
this will actually save me time or

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,340
something something thing that'll always

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,530
happen also a lot of systems must run

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,079
for for some time at least in parallel

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:53,019
especially monitoring because that's

00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:54,640
what you verify your systems with so

00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,930
actually you double the work because now

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,880
you have the old system and you have the

00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,040
new system both need to work in parallel

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,810
and both need to be maintained people

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,620
really love that when detail they do

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:08,920
twice the work so how do you get them to

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,239
do this also if you've got well

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,140
established processes or well

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,780
established tools and you show a new way

00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,209
in some way you often encounter that if

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:22,120
you are right someone else must be wrong

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,729
and most often those people who

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,240
consider themselves wrong or it at risk

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:30,160
of being proven wrong or what have you

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,729
those are the people who are long at the

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,850
company and who have some investment at

00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:39,400
least on some sort within hierarchy so

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,900
those are actually people able to to

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,260
actually block whatever you're trying to

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:46,600
do unless you actually give them a way

00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,540
to to accept the change without losing

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,210
face and quite often you'll have had

00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,280
motivations it might be as simple as

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,490
someone liking the color of the UI or

00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,530
whatever I had countless discussions

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:04,660
about Ravana being black default or

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:06,220
white default I don't care but some

00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,560
people care really really strongly and

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,600
you you kind of have to take this into

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,910
account they might also be able to get

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,430
your or they might feel you want a job

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,900
or whatever but these are things which

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,080
you have to keep in mind

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:23,020
and while these formulas for change

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,300
might be more of a comedic relief there

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,690
are some underlying truth which really

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,849
really you have to take into account I

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,910
don't know if you're familiar with the

00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:36,280
iron law institutions it's basically the

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,260
very short version is people would

00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,389
rather see their whatever organization

00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,400
failed and lose power within the

00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:44,410
organization and every one of you can

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,510
think of at least a few examples of this

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,430
happening somewhere around you beat

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:52,630
professionally or beat privately or

00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:54,820
somewhere else people cling to whatever

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,410
power they pursuit perceived to have and

00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,539
you have to take this into account

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,500
because this is something which happens

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:04,270
and the other thing which is also

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,460
extremely important there is this

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,620
concept of four stages of competence and

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,470
again it's probably pretty

00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,240
uncontroversial that this is the path

00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,250
you go through no matter what kind of

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,169
field of or expertise you're looking at

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,880
it's always the same at first you don't

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,250
realize that you're actually incompetent

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,760
then you kind of notice that you don't

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:28,060
really know a lot of things then you're

00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:30,610
cautiously knowledgeable about stuff and

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,650
then at some point hopefully it just

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,960
goes into your blood and into your being

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,580
and you just know what

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,250
right and you don't even know how you

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,449
know but the thing is who will fight the

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:45,660
most it'll be the unconscious people

00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:46,710
because and also the young competent

00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,490
people because they can't even grasp

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:51,990
what you're trying to do so you have a

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,880
few of the really really good people

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,220
maybe and you have a lot of them not

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,870
quite so good people who still have a

00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,470
voice and still want to be heard and

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:03,569
they will fight for whatever reason and

00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,039
also if you look at the key people who

00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:07,020
could support you because they are the

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,690
actual ones who can enact change within

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,430
whatever organization you're in those

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:16,229
are the ones who will be cautious

00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:18,840
because a lot of them will be in we can

00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:20,479
see it in the third group that's

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,900
actually where most people hopefully sit

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,870
and this means that those people who

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:30,240
could actually grab your banner and run

00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:33,120
with it they won't because they're super

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,680
cautious until they'll wait until they

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:41,130
know if it's good and there is view

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,550
killers if you run into those forget

00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,550
your change

00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:49,800
if you impact revenue management will

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,690
tell you to stop period if you bring a

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,880
central system down the same if you wake

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,530
up people quite a lot it's it's coming

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,690
from a different angle but still people

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,120
will just try to stop you in whatever

00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:03,229
you and you have to keep this in mind

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:08,340
when you're doing anything which is

00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:14,190
challenging the status quo so what our

00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:16,889
approaches to to fixing this one and

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:19,759
this is probably the first thing you

00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:22,560
want to do once you have a sort of ish

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,630
concept of what you want to do and this

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,000
will change our retirement do it is at

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,650
first it will be very functional and and

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,810
it's very abstract and then it will

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,630
start to become more specific it's a

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,459
process I'm going through myself with

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:38,370
introducing primitives at work

00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:40,409
you literally or probably put a big

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,810
picture on the wall and tell people this

00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,879
is what I want to

00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:46,519
have in the end can we agree on having

00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:48,529
this in the end and the reason why I

00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:50,389
think you should agree on having this in

00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:53,329
the end is because this little part is

00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:55,129
what you care about you might agree that

00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:56,660
it fits fits in a big picture and you

00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:58,430
will always have a few people who get

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,019
this and run with you but most people

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:04,459
you just showed what they care about and

00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:06,290
that's where you start so what you're

00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:08,240
basically doing is you're playing to

00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:12,470
their own intrinsic or internal

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,839
motivation that what what does this guy

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,389
do what does that woman want ET cpp

00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,029
that's what you what do you have to to

00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,740
get it and then you get buy-in from a

00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:23,360
few key players they might be management

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,439
that might be technical yeah ideally

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,480
they're both and even if you're not in

00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:31,249
the room or not part of the meeting or

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,769
you have distributed teams all over the

00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:35,990
world if as long as enough people agree

00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:37,999
on this big picture if they make any

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,910
decision going forward about how to

00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:42,800
implement X they might look at the big

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,629
picture and decide okay I could do it

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,189
this way that might not align and I can

00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:48,529
do it that way that will align with the

00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:50,990
big picture and so you have some sort of

00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:53,660
distributed syncing of actions across

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,920
what every organization is because or

00:09:53,660 --> 00:10:00,399
that we they want to end up over here

00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,399
and not over there quite easy in theory

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:06,309
the next thing comes again to the

00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:10,129
intrinsic motivations of the people

00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:12,559
someone once said and this has stuck for

00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:14,600
me like forever for years now that it's

00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,670
quite easy to talk to an engineer about

00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,620
a function and he'll talk for hours and

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,470
hours and he'll get back to you and talk

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,230
again about those in this function try

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,699
it with the CEO he literally will not

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,399
care and why should he

00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:30,679
because it's none of his concern he

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,509
doesn't have to hear he never cared in

00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:35,629
his life and he never ever will care and

00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:38,179
that's fully okay because within his

00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:40,970
picture of the world it's irrelevant or

00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,800
he has people for it so this is

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,709
something you you have to take into

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,329
account measures they will always care

00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:50,209
about revenue because else the company

00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:53,059
is dead easy and they wanted processes

00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:54,620
however they're defined are executed now

00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:55,370
you don't really care about the details

00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,720
of the pros

00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,180
designed that they care about the

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,650
execution architects they actually care

00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,300
about the design and they actually care

00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,490
about the definition of the process and

00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,500
actually how the details of the proces

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,360
should look like

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,830
service and product owners they mostly

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,200
care about pretty dashboards or maybe

00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,360
Excel sheets or you export the data in

00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,070
whatever form you need but as long as

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,680
they get the data out of whatever they

00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:21,260
need they're pretty happy so for example

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,410
we switched our internal accounting of

00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,810
how we calculate the cost of a a mailbox

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,100
which you can buy in our company do you

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:31,730
permit this because it's quite easy to

00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,770
have storage / / / mailbox on average

00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,470
both my customer and buy domain and buy

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:38,660
a total and so it's quite easy to get an

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,940
actual cost of one single average

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:44,000
mailbox so product management is using

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:48,250
that data to make prices for the product

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,510
and suddenly they like the system

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:53,410
teammates obviously care about teams

00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:56,740
being happy that's kinda obvious an

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:59,839
engineer's mostly care about sleep and

00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:03,860
sometimes also socialize yeah Julie's

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,450
aggressive because time is pretty much

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,339
the most precious commodity for all of

00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,640
those guys but the engineers are the one

00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:13,790
who quite often invest the most time and

00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,680
personal time so basically what you do

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,100
is you tell everyone what they need to

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,120
hear

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,680
but you never ever lie you always point

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,050
to the big picture and you tell this is

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,600
the place you care about that one maybe

00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,070
also about that one but this is the big

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,190
picture of you on sit down read through

00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,930
it everything's in the open but only

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,839
tell them what they really need to hear

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:38,420
never lie and if they're interested tell

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,140
them or if not doesn't matter they know

00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,670
what you care about

00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:49,040
that's enough another approach is sheer

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:51,860
luck like literally sheer luck the back

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,740
story of this was I found stuff in our

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,140
internal systems and I know I couldn't

00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,760
want to hurt I didn't really even know

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,190
what it did turns out there were made

00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,070
Mail gateways I didn't care I don't even

00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,480
care today but I found them and I just

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:08,450
animal monitoring for them with

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,090
infirmities and I told a few people and

00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:13,610
like I don't know week later two weeks

00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,740
later someone said a wrong flag in a

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:18,740
server country and all of a sudden this

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,660
server accepts outside email then the

00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,480
spammers comment they do a real clean

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,190
engineering ramp up of the server they

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,020
try how much can it take

00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:30,710
and they basically go like this when you

00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:32,570
look at at the email which is quite good

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:36,920
engineering unfortunately they're the

00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:38,330
bad guys so what happens at some point

00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,830
during the night because obviously they

00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:43,400
would know what what time zone we are

00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:45,620
living in they know full throttle at our

00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,280
mail service and our mail gateways start

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,960
to become quite unhappy and yonk all

00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,020
because he knew he had that new system

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,520
and was keen to play with it

00:13:53,020 --> 00:14:01,930
he literally and you can ask him he's

00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,930
sitting over there in a blue shirt yes

00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:07,730
he literally told me afterwards that it

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,130
took him about 30 seconds after he was

00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,230
in a VPN to actually debug the problem

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,550
as opposed to at least an hour across

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,130
several different people so it's

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,930
actually more than more than just sixty

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,700
minutes which would have been wasted and

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:23,330
it's at night people want to sleep and

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,980
so he just sees okay that's what's the

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:28,160
problem he fixes his he goes back to

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:30,860
sleep and on the next day he's standing

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,350
next to my desk and great because this

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,970
help and other people here does other

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,160
people see this and all of a sudden you

00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,590
have more buy-in from other people and

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,390
it was sheer luck in the timing but

00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,860
still this is a valid approach because

00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,280
it worked really well and you'll also

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,810
always have one or two of those that you

00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,000
do something and you don't even intend

00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,470
for it to be useful but as long as it's

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,120
well executed and you keep people

00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,430
informed at some point it'll help

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,820
someone and they'll be happy about it

00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,590
and they'll talk about it so there is a

00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,440
few carrots which you can Daniel in

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:05,930
front of people coming back to engineers

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,079
which in America monitoring conference

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:13,300
is probably what you care about

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:15,369
it's sleep again and there's a few

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,129
simple rules which are somewhat

00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:20,050
monitoring or service specific but still

00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:22,269
this is something which you can just put

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,369
in front of people and you'll get buy-in

00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:25,709
from a lot of Engineers because that's

00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:28,749
what they care about

00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:31,509
it's the mantra of promises at least

00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:33,970
partially if it's a vegetable it's not

00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:35,619
an alert if it's not urgent it's not an

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,420
alert if it's important but not urgent

00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:39,489
you can do the next step business day

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,279
doesn't matter if it becomes urgent you

00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:43,839
can still call it on call and they can

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,619
fix it once it's urgent

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:49,629
but not when it's only important if

00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:51,939
there's no playbook it doesn't go into

00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:53,679
production if you don't have any SLS

00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:55,869
internally it doesn't go into production

00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,009
if it doesn't have any alerting it

00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:59,319
doesn't go into production

00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:01,779
it's a very very simple and very obvious

00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:03,759
rules but these are all of a sudden and

00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:10,600
able your engineers to see more and they

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:12,369
love you and you have fired toil

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,399
if someone are at the SRU books you're

00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:17,649
familiar with the term if you didn't

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,569
basically toilettes any work which has

00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:21,610
no lasting benefit which you do manually

00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:23,559
and which spells roughly linearly with

00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:27,670
the amount of services or machines or

00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:29,860
users or whatever if people are busy

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,499
firefighting because there's just more

00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,420
services more users more whatever they

00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:37,269
will not have time to properly engineer

00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,399
the actual systems and they'll hate that

00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:42,819
state because they want to engineer else

00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:44,559
they would be engineers you obviously

00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:46,720
have to keep it legacy working and

00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,759
that's the judo chance against and

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,569
that's where we have more work not less

00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:53,889
work for a short period of time but you

00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:56,410
should keep the extra effort low

00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:59,619
obviously you should strive for at least

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:01,720
a few small immediate benefits not maybe

00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:03,549
even because they are hugely important

00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,889
but just to show people okay here's a

00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:07,990
carrot here's bread crumbs this works

00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:11,709
with me and we end up in a better place

00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:16,299
and obviously focus on removing on

00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:20,199
removing the actual toil then you have

00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:21,430
that's obviously for me too specific the

00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:23,950
leverage with improve

00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:28,060
his face you've got one system for all

00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:31,540
the things you have you can suddenly

00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:33,910
have totally different program domains

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,160
correlated with each other for example

00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,230
if your if your optical long hawlings go

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,320
down when the temperature outside drops

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,150
or it just has a large change that's

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,810
some something which can actually happen

00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:48,520
in real world optical networks that's

00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,960
something which he probably because it's

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,400
the same system which monitors thoughts

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,090
are temperature and your optical

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,740
networking each other you can correlate

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:59,650
correlate does not imply causation but

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,390
still you can correlate or data center

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,370
load against a new service running

00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:05,410
because this is obviously a cost factor

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:09,190
and so you can put that back into into

00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:12,400
your into your pricing and lots more and

00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:14,290
it's all prompt here you also have this

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,500
system of an Oracle because all of a

00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:19,600
sudden you have one source of truth and

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,010
people tend to not really disagree when

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,670
the data they are basing their

00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:25,930
assumption on is roughly the same if

00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,310
you're running more than one from you

00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:30,400
this thing might not fully agree but

00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,960
roughly they'll agree so you have one

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,800
source of truth for all the things which

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:38,560
you need to beat dashboards beefed PDFs

00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,390
be it something which a a sales drone

00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,400
can just put in front of a potential

00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:46,690
customer and tell him ok across all our

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,370
services our SLO is at least X that's

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,350
something you really like because all of

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:53,680
a sudden they can improve to potential

00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:55,750
customers a that's what we have that's

00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,690
how good we are and it's really really

00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:01,510
really easy to get at the data and all

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:03,190
of a sudden sales people talk positively

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:06,340
about the monitoring engineering is

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,170
yuning that's quite a weird feeling but

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,330
this is something again you have someone

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:12,190
within the company who is helping you

00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,480
push the change they might talk to

00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,700
someone at the watercooler who's

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,140
blocking change at the moment and tell

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:22,090
them hey does this really useful for me

00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:24,219
and suddenly you have more buyer yeah

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:28,149
there's also one other thing this is not

00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:30,279
related to social challenges currently

00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:31,840
we are working on and I'm just mixing

00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:37,389
this into the thing because I have this

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:39,759
lot anyway currently we are working on

00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:41,349
spinning Prometheus for exposition form

00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,299
into its own thing into its own project

00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:46,659
it's called open metrics at least for

00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:49,539
now we do plan to publish an RFC simply

00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:50,950
because I this helps with some

00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:52,690
old-school lenders especially in

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:55,389
networking segments and also if you're

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,249
able to slip a random RC into a public

00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:59,080
tender or in a fireman's list or

00:19:57,249 --> 00:20:01,869
somewhere all of a sudden you are

00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,649
legally requiring a vendor to provide

00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:07,629
Prometheus metrics this is really nice

00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:11,320
so yeah we'll do that if you're

00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:14,849
interested being for is there and now

00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,849
I'm taking questions on both of these

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:28,580
[Laughter]

00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:28,580
then thank you Richard where's my mics

00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:42,200
where's the hand son I would hope

00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,200
there's about roughly 440 hands in here

00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,779
if you want I can think of 40 questions

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:56,070
so I would like to ask you for an advice

00:20:51,710 --> 00:21:00,799
how to convince developers to agree to

00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,799
use actually any monitoring system

00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:18,809
really good one that a couple weeks ago

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:22,880
but what okay no I had I had a really

00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:25,320
great one for that a couple weeks ago a

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,240
developer and an administrator were

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,600
arguing over what to set for a timeout

00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:34,200
and all we had to do was go into the

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:37,580
metrics and find out what the 99.9% tile

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,929
was for the timeout and then that just

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,510
stopped the argument because we could we

00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:43,919
had data to do some make a decision so

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,049
having the instrumentation and having

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,539
the metrics allowed us to make a

00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:49,919
informed decision instead of the

00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,690
database developer thought the timeout

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,940
was too short and the administrator

00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,049
thought the timeout was too long we just

00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,240
need to look at the data and see what

00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:59,490
would cause the acceptable amount of

00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:05,760
user harm by changing the timeout do we

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:07,529
have this on tape yes I'll stop

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,090
interrupting Richard yeah also if you

00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:11,820
are familiar with error budgets that's

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,980
something which helps convince

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:16,110
developers because basically it's a

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,570
concept of you have X downtime per

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:20,490
service per month or poor whatever time

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,440
frame you have and you can use that for

00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,360
downtown you can use it for work for

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,340
changes you can do it for whatever in

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,409
extreme cases you just use it for

00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,320
downtime to force people to not overly

00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:33,809
rely on your service and basically this

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,429
gives you an independancy of developers

00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:36,590
and operate

00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:39,200
this is a metric which they really

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,720
really have to care about because either

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,110
they use it for for breakage or for

00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,759
features to actually get the time and to

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,580
actually get their error budget they

00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:51,590
have to integrate monitoring but for

00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,580
example now if I want to make them to

00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:54,440
use prometheus

00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,950
they would need to learn everything

00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,619
about writing and exporter and use that

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:04,700
in their applications and would it be

00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:08,119
the thought I have just to tell them to

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:10,850
write some exporter in JSON format and

00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:13,789
then I write exporter for primitives

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:18,049
like the proper way to use leave elusive

00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:20,659
whatever the price personally I help

00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:22,659
people with what their metric names

00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:26,419
should be what their label set should be

00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:28,279
and if they do it literally by hand into

00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:29,509
a print statement I'm fine with that as

00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:31,730
long as they get the data into

00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:33,259
parameters and once there converts they

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:36,200
all do everything else by themselves

00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:39,559
anyway but make it easy as possible for

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:42,139
them to getting benefit or the more evil

00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:43,519
way to just show where you have

00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:45,440
interdependencies within your

00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:49,159
organisation where other people would

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,470
depend on X being implemented and it's

00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:53,809
not and just because you've got a nicely

00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,470
to the big picture and there's a blind

00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:56,840
spot

00:23:54,470 --> 00:24:02,869
okay.thank and people will start arguing

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:04,519
with the team so I have a question

00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:06,830
regarding first of all thank you for the

00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:07,279
great talk I think the the social aspect

00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,080
of it

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,820
he's always extremely interesting

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,179
because as you said it's always about

00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,350
people in almost all of the companies

00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:17,690
that I've worked for

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:21,080
I've almost always seen this iron rule

00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:23,779
of power sort of happening I didn't know

00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,299
that was the term for it um but I've

00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:28,840
never really had a way to sort of

00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:31,039
mitigate it or to do anything about it

00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,139
um I was I don't know I was wondering

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,570
from the perspective of like an engineer

00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:37,789
how have you dealt with this type of

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,919
problem because you know it's it's a

00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:44,690
problem that happens over a period of

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:46,909
time it doesn't happen overnight well in

00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,420
my personal situation having been from

00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:50,450
the CEO

00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:53,570
helps so that's kind of because he can

00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:57,140
push people away you can't push but in

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:59,780
the generic case there is a certain

00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,400
cutoff and when you really are within an

00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,230
organization where you have to tried

00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,510
everything what you can reasonably try

00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:08,630
and everything you're willing to try

00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:10,250
that's one of my person or it would be

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,050
one of my person cut offs to just say

00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,050
okay I'm done

00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:16,940
goodbye because if you're really in a

00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:19,490
situation where you think you have to do

00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,620
something in a certain way no matter if

00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,630
you're wrong or right but you're

00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,140
convinced that you need this to work

00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,570
properly

00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:30,130
ie to really be happy during working

00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:33,410
hours and you can't make this happen

00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:36,710
you're in your own organization it's

00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:39,560
harsh but that's the end consequence

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,870
there's a lot of steps before but as

00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,170
soon as you're aware of I'm not stuck I

00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:47,030
can actually get out if I really need to

00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:49,790
this changes context in your mind

00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:52,280
and this actually sometimes gives you

00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:54,890
different angle in arguments with you or

00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,260
a team leader or whatever because you

00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,060
can talk about different things you you

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,830
don't have to talk about this is what I

00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,420
would like to do bla bla bla you can

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:04,310
talk you can say okay this is what I

00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:06,140
think would be best it's okay if I don't

00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:10,280
get buy-in but as a certain point I need

00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:12,980
to leave and if they value that's

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,660
something you listen to so to sum it up

00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:18,620
it's about having a good relationship

00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:21,920
with like management and also trying to

00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:24,500
push a certain agenda that you deem is a

00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,480
responsible and a constructive one well

00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,480
it actually it definitely makes it

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:33,230
easier when you have good contact to

00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:35,030
people and that's copies or if you're

00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:38,600
just able to use site that's basically

00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:41,720
the same thing or almost if you're

00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,670
really the only one no matter what other

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,770
levels you have if you get all the team

00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:48,680
leads to agree on something that are

00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:51,320
already quite important or just a few

00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,900
key players so you don't need to have

00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:58,700
the big hammer to to smash everyone else

00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:00,350
it's but if you really are alone yeah

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,690
you lost

00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:04,880
thank you there is one more question

00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,830
over here and it's not really question I

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,779
just wanted to chime in on the previous

00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:11,899
question it is like how can I make the

00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:12,529
developer to too bright to instrument

00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:14,120
their code

00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:15,860
I think sometimes there is a bit of

00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,000
disconnection between the development

00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:22,009
team and production operations team and

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,169
developers feel like that whenever that

00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:25,940
is ready they just hand it to the

00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:27,559
operation things and then that's that

00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,769
problem so there's a little bit of

00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:33,590
disconnection there or out suggest is to

00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:37,879
practice more tab at the Von's approach

00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:41,090
and this approach so to involve

00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:42,740
developers also to actually manage the

00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:46,070
operation side of the things like

00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:48,139
managing services in production and give

00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:50,570
them much more ownership because if they

00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:51,830
feel like their service is gone down

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,019
because there is not enough mint

00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,549
monitoring or something's coming but you

00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:57,200
don't know what really went bad but they

00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:59,210
feel like it's not a responsibility it's

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,490
not that problem you will never be able

00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:05,000
to force them to use monitoring system

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,950
and I'm a developer myself and no one

00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,649
ever told me use parameters because it's

00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:11,029
called for monitoring etc I just felt

00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:12,590
like whenever something was going wrong

00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:13,879
in production or just couldn't fix it

00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,980
because I didn't know what was going on

00:28:13,879 --> 00:28:18,980
and since I had completely ownership of

00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,409
api's assistance whatever I felt I have

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,610
to do something more so milling to this

00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:25,070
there is this little bit of

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:27,139
disconnection and if more ownership is

00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,950
given to the development in they will

00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:34,159
feel like I have to put the xDrive 410

00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:36,080
really integrate immediacy dashboards on

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,330
Hanah so that I can tell when something

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,690
that goes bad that it is I don't know

00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:44,149
latency these network is whatever I

00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:50,120
don't know if apps a little bit the

00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:52,429
previous question all right we're gonna

00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,870
have a 15 minute break now so it's been

00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:55,870
calm or coffee or coffee

00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:09,640
[Music]

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,779
you

00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,779
