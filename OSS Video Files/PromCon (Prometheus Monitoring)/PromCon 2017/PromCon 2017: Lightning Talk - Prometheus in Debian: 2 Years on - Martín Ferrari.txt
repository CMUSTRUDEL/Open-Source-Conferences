[Music]

00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:19,859
so I really give gave a similar talk

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:23,550
last year so maybe this is a tradition

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:26,340
known to happen but it's been already

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:31,800
two years of working in Prometheus on

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,329
Debian I I started working as soon as I

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,350
heard about the announcement of

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,960
Prometheus I'm a I'm a developer and I

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,579
used to work at Google and I was big fan

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,500
of per month so that the day I saw this

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,649
I jump immediately and I wanted this to

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,890
be ready in Debian to be installed by

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,710
everybody in their servers

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:56,610
and well I'm not at Google anymore so

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,320
now I'm a freelancer and yeah for many

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,829
people talking about they being here may

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,409
seem weird because everybody is doing

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:07,979
get flown from head and building things

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:11,210
and downloading a unsigned binaries from

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:16,740
for docker images and that kind of thing

00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:20,070
yeah many of you will think that we're

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,689
irrelevant but well there's certain

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,280
people a certain group of people that

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,700
think that we are still very much

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,070
relevant that we are the way to go at

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,229
least CSUN means we are at phase of

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,570
assignments and they also lead

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,549
monitoring it's actually the kind of

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,970
tool that you really want to have in

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,500
your stable server and they can progress

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,079
other things like proper integrations

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,030
and defaults security support I kind of

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:53,149
think that you should usually don't get

00:01:45,030 --> 00:02:00,329
by doing a call by sudo bash so um I

00:01:53,149 --> 00:02:02,670
started working on this in 2015 last

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:06,899
year was a lot of work it was the freeze

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:09,750
and the new stable release was was

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,920
released launched this may stretch is

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,620
called

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,739
so after two years of work it paid off

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,069
now prometheus is in stable it has it's

00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,390
a really boom - it's in Cali probably

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:23,459
other derivatives there are so many

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,790
that's like 120 derivatives of Debian

00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:30,150
and usually all the packages are in

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:35,819
Debian automatically go to the others so

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:41,280
I will show you bits the states even if

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:42,569
people say we are always old and and

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:49,110
lagging behind

00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:52,170
we are still not so bad so that tables

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:54,630
yeah I got the wrong version for

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,480
promises the most important one so well

00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:01,440
in all stable using a backboard so you

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,140
have 1 5 2 in a stretch you have one

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,370
fight - - but you shouldn't post in back

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:11,989
course you have one six one seven yeah

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,549
sorry everybody that means today

00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:18,600
interesting - then we have the other

00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:21,420
manager CEO of go in 5.1 in all stable

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,359
unstable and in testing I also blowed it

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,010
yesterday I think SEO 6 - the new

00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,049
version is gonna take a bit more because

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,700
this own thing it's gonna take me

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:34,260
forever to package but we will see I

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:38,030
will get there trying you guys make it

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:41,880
really difficult for me push back we see

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:44,370
0.307 stable super foreign testing so

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,350
all the others underlines versions has

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,680
the one I'm planning to upgrade race

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:56,579
soon now the news Porter also c-13 and

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:58,739
c14 testing all the pre recent quite a

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,390
few exporters that are all readily

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,150
available and we'd seen defaults and

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,400
whatnot so have the patch exported as an

00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,700
experimental actually a black box port

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,069
and mail exporter MongoDB my sequel the

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,389
post response port ah specifics for the

00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:16,530
varnish

00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:20,580
n tail HS upgraded to 3.0 version and C

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:23,520
advisor and all of this works is well

00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,800
integrated and go the confusion goes

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,569
into the right place

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:33,360
etc and finally some theories of course

00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:34,650
to go play library has a pill crime

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,430
every probably nobody heard about that

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,500
one

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:42,479
of course the Python the Chango

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:44,789
integration all we recent versions to so

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,509
yeah that's it I just wanted to give you

00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:49,979
a status update on all their work me and

a few other people have been doing in

00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:55,430
this past two years so yeah and if you
