00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:20,550
to prom Con 2017 the second one which we

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,619
have ever had thank you for making way

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,350
to Munich which is way prettier than

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,240
Berlin and without much further ado I'll

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,820
introduce Julius he's the co-founder of

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,820
Prometheus and the rest you already know

00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:43,130
thank you regime yeah welcome to prom

00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,600
Con 2017 I have to disagree with the

00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,970
Munich statement of course because I'm

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,180
from Berlin but Munich is very beautiful

00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,559
as well yeah this is now more than twice

00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:56,809
as big as last year it's pretty

00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:59,480
impressive and yeah so welcome and thank

00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:01,520
you everyone for coming the attendees so

00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,530
without you of course this conference

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,560
wouldn't happen but of course also very

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,680
special thank you to everyone who helped

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,630
organize the conference many people from

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,210
the Prometheus open-source team but also

00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,920
the cognitive computing Foundation which

00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:19,880
helped us to you know some of the

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,680
financial stuff and registration and you

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,780
know this is really a conference that's

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,390
not professionally organized it's really

00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,820
all based on volunteer work so I hope

00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:30,470
you forgive us if we have like small

00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,380
things here and they're not working out

00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:37,580
all the time but I hope it'll be great

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:40,070
anyways so what happened since last year

00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,619
last year I told you a bit about how

00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,500
Prometheus got created in 2012 at

00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:48,860
SoundCloud then got finally published in

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,450
2015 we joined the CN CF the cloud

00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,270
native computing foundation and then we

00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,729
had our first big milestone when we

00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:58,160
released Prometheus one the first stable

00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:59,929
release and then we had prawn con and

00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,280
that was amazing but what happened since

00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:07,849
then so there wasn't one huge big event

00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,590
that happened between then and now but

00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:11,900
there's just been a lot of really

00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,990
amazing coding work going on in

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:18,910
prometheus and the main work really has

00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:22,040
all been around Prometheus 2.0 which

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,590
includes as its main huge new thing

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,810
completely rewritten time series

00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,849
database we'll hear more about that

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,520
tomorrow so I won't go into the details

00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:33,620
here but it's amazing it's like it's

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,450
going to be way better in every resource

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,330
dimension and I'm just totally looking

00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,910
forward to prometheus too there's also

00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,849
been working out adding remote read and

00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:46,400
write storage integrations and a lot of

00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:49,709
other things like staleness handling for

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:55,049
prometheus 2 and other things

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:59,040
so now we have prom Con 2017 we are not

00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:01,319
a company so we don't try to time major

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,079
releases to coincide exactly with

00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,840
conferences we really software when it's

00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:09,930
ready and when it's done so Prometheus 2

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,099
is not quite out today but it's going to

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,040
be out very soon now

00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,510
so estimates range from one to three

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,629
months or something like this but

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:24,629
definitely this year but no guarantees

00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:27,060
when it is ready so yeah so are we still

00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:29,159
growing last you asked this question as

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,579
a joke who knows what the most important

00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:34,169
metric is for an open-source project

00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:40,049
Geir top stars of course and you think

00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:41,819
they're still going up okay so this to

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,859
me still looks very exciting and this is

00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:47,340
cumulative across all our github

00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:50,819
projects we are at almost 16,000 stars

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,530
in total oh so that's pretty amazing and

00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,139
from a community side I mean obviously

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,150
this is kind of a funny graph and you

00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:59,609
know if you get on Hacker News it goes

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,829
up a lot and if not then not so I don't

00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:04,250
know how useful it really is but it's

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:04,250
still pretty cool

00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:09,329
but in terms of an ecosystem we went up

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:15,060
a lot and in the total number of

00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:19,169
contributors went from 3 350 plus to 650

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:22,650
plus within the year and also got some

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:25,289
new core contributors we more than

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,870
doubled the amount the number of our

00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:30,630
third-party integrations like exporters

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,030
and you know natively instrumented

00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,449
open-source software what are you saying

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,610
right over 200 now ok I just did the

00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:40,229
count of what we had on the website plus

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,070
some extra ones that I knew about so

00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:44,789
yeah it's good

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:46,620
it seemed larger so looking at the kind

00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:49,110
of companies that are using prometheus

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,020
it's I would say getting just more

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,430
diverse there we of course still have

00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,710
like all these kind of tech companies

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,669
like digital ocean cloud fair and so on

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,590
using Prometheus in one way or the other

00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:03,410
but also organized

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:05,360
since like CERN the European nuclear

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,370
research center are using promises for

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,020
some things the New York Times is

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,970
totally betting on it they get to talk

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,070
about it we just recently learned that

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,320
Deutsche Bahn which is the German

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,480
railway company is going to monitor all

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,660
their signage systems in all German

00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:23,600
train stations with like Nordic sporter

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,510
and Prometheus basically that's pretty

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,100
amazing so when you're like walking in a

00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,990
German train station now you see oh

00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,380
there's Prometheus running somewhere

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,380
about me

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,010
companies like BNY Mellon it's a bank

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,170
that manages trillions of dollars in

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,650
assets so you really also have these

00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:45,110
more you know very traditional order

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,790
kind of organizations starting to adopt

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,010
Prometheus which is really exciting for

00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:53,390
me because this really means it's

00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:56,060
mainstream now so great back to some

00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,440
organizational stuff you know what you

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,650
actually you should expect during the

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,700
conference first of all please tweet the

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:07,430
official hashtag is Frank on 2017 oh

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,200
great I've got the year right there also

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:14,000
feel free to mention our Twitter account

00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:17,060
prometheus IO we will have lightning

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,270
talks on both days between 5:00 and 6:00

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,730
p.m. we have a little flip shot outside

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,470
where you can possibly store write and

00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:28,670
talks but Brian do we still have any

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:30,200
slots do you think ok brian says yeah if

00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,300
you're if you're lucky and you still

00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,290
write yourself in there quickly you

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,390
might still get a lightning talk

00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,670
lightning talks are strictly five

00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,610
minutes only so if you want to still

00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:44,150
talk about anything short keep it to

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:47,390
that but otherwise add it there we will

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:50,410
have an evening event it's pretty close

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,940
to here like 10-15 minutes walk at

00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,700
Augustine abolish doom it's a Bavarian

00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,590
brewery style place there's beer but

00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,600
there's also non-alcoholic drinks and

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,100
there's going to be some finger food not

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,140
a lot so if you're going to be very

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,870
hungry you might want to also get food

00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,270
somewhere else but you know otherwise it

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,450
should be fine and there's a map in the

for a conference like this it's 80 euros

00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:55,939
