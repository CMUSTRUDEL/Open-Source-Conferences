Title: PromCon 2017: Using TSDB as a library - Goutham Veeramachaneni
Publication date: 2017-09-01
Playlist: PromCon 2017
Description: 
	* Abstract:

This talk will be an introductory talk about using the new datastore as a library. It will be based on this blog: https://geekon.tech/content/post/tsdb-embeddable-timeseries-database/ with clearer and more verbose examples and a simple REST based timeseries demo at the end.

People will leave with:

* A clear understanding of how to use tsdb.
* The fundamentals that are needed to start contributing to the tsdb to Prometheus layer.

* Speaker biography:

I am a Student and a developer from India. But I like Ops more than Dev and Go more than all! My enthusiasm for Ops got me an internship on the infra team of a large company last summer where I worked on Production infrastructure and built the company's monitoring system on top of Prometheus.

That was my first encounter with production systems and Prometheus, and recently I started contributing to Prometheus again on the side and am now interning with CoreOS working on Prometheus' new storage engine.
