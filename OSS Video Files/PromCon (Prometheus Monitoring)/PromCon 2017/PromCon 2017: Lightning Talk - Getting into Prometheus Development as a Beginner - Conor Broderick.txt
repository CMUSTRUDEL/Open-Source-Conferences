[Music]

00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,580
hello my name is Connor Broderick I'm

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,650
from Dublin Ireland I'm a somewhat

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:23,039
recent university graduate working for

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,260
robust perception and we are the world's

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,449
only company dedicated to support

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,119
consulting and training in regards to

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,859
Prometheus and I'm also I believe the

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,960
last time I checked the newest member of

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,370
the prometheus team I'm here today to

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:42,629
give you a quick lightning talk I'm

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:44,309
getting to give you a really quick

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,070
lightning talk I'm getting into a

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,000
Prometheus development as a beginning or

00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,640
someone who's just completely new to

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,020
open-source and as a relative maybe to

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,239
this Fielden community I feel it's time

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,129
I kind of you know fresh perspective on

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,899
and recently enter in it may prove

00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,399
useful to those of you out there who

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,719
have yet to contribute to open source or

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:06,119
more specifically Prometheus itself so

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,650
first steps my first advice to anyone

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,619
getting involved in the Prometheus

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,299
community is to learn it's landscape

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,950
essentially and by that I mean you need

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,930
to gain a really high-level overview of

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,070
the project its components and how they

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,780
all interact with one another

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,270
I went about this in a number of

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,100
different ways the first which is quite

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,710
obvious is by reading the documentation

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,119
over a Prometheus that I oh why it's

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,890
literally the manual for getting your

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,079
head around Prometheus different parts

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,549
of components it's actually fairly sure

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,659
if you get through the day it gives a

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,820
great breakdown of all the key

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,790
components for such as alerting

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,110
configuration instrumentation etc it

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,850
covers pretty pretty much anything

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,770
everything needs to get going when it

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,509
comes to you know looking at the issues

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,570
and tackling them one kid over at this

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,549
project the next point I would say is to

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,170
watch and listen to previous talks from

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,270
Prometheus contributors and team members

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,470
many of the speaker's here today have

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,229
been working on the Prometheus project

00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,909
since or close to its inception and they

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,330
have loads of talks online for free on

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,190
YouTube and whatnot

00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,590
I would be careful while diving into the

00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,180
soft as well you can imagine and some of

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,369
them range from quite introductory to

00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,660
quite complicated and complex and they

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:15,020
may not apply to what you're trying to

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:17,300
do and the next point I'd say is reading

00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,460
blog posts a shameless plug for our own

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,870
blog atropos perception duo which has

00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,660
been mentioned a few times in the talks

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,340
today and the official Prometheus blog

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,920
itself is also a great source and

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,210
provides many useful tutorials and tips

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,130
and tricks to help you understand

00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,560
previous a little better than just from

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,790
reading the docs itself again many of

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,130
the speaker's here today ruined their

00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,390
own blogs and they also share much of

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,190
their wisdom and shapes related

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,930
committees to which all helps build this

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,500
mental image in your head and how it all

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:47,510
works and fits together so and finally I

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,030
would say playing around with the local

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,470
deployment of Prometheus itself with the

00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,060
node exporter on your own box at home

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,650
maybe hoping to find the dashboard

00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,100
there's tons of tutorials to this online

00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,740
that's really simple man so what do you

00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,200
do next know that you're a certified

00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,300
Prometheus expert you contribute so

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,310
let's start with contributing code when

00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,020
it comes to completing your first issue

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,239
on github I'd recommend checking out the

00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,640
low-hanging fruit and Help Wanted tags

00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,470
as the name States these issues tend to

00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,780
be the easiest ones to tackle initially

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,400
and they're also the ones - the

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,680
Prometheus team are actively looking for

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,209
Exide out for so they will give you

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,620
feedback answer questions and help you

00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:29,000
have any start pushing code for these

00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,800
issues and I'd also recommend by not

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,810
starting out with Prometheus itself as

00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,120
it's a lot harder to get your head

00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,620
around than like the components the sub

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,630
components like the exporters and the

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,130
clients so I'd recommend maybe maybe

00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,600
have a look at them first before looking

00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,400
at Prometheus because the cow is a lot

00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,989
easier to its opposite - way shorter and

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,550
you can get your head around it a lot

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:51,470
easier and how else can you help ask and

00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,000
answer questions namely subscribe to the

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,250
Promethean through to the Prometheus

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,050
users mailing list their Prometheus

00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,450
Stack Overflow tag and joining the

00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:02,510
conversation or the IRC channel hash

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,310
Prometheus on matrix I think you'll

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,570
honestly learn so much having read the

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,340
docs if you follow and read the

00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,530
questions and answered answers posted

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,610
here doing so you'll get a good feel of

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,080
the typical issues users come in contact

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,540
with this will help you answer questions

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,040
in the future and you'll also see the

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,079
thought process of the other top

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,820
processes of the other more experienced

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,280
knowledgeable people answering these

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,200
questions these insights the main

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,910
contributors are invaluable and help

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,710
make sense the high-level overview you

00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,300
of digestive from reading the docs but

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:35,200
it'll also put it more into a practical

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,000
like in practice way for you overall I'd

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,160
say don't be nervous jump in and go for

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,270
it if you need any help with go along if

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,220
you haven't written go before I

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,840
personally read introducing go which is

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,400
a dead simple introduction to the

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,650
language I'm in concurrency model and

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:52,300
stuff like that but the second book ever

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:54,669
has and go and practice and husband has

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,050
more kind of go patterns you come across

00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,520
and it makes reading the code a lot

00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,560
easier having read that book about my

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,850
experience it is anyway and if you've

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,500
any questions were to slightly talk

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,000
Prometheus or life in general general

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,800
feel free to catch me after a buzz

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,780
perception booth inside or I'll be at

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,780
the after party afterwards thanks

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:24,000
[Music]

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,139
