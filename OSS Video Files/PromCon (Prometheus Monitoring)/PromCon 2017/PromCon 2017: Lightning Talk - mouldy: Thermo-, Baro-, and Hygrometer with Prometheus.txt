[Music]

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:23,039
hi I'm Nicola I live in Berlin and my

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,300
apartment had a moldy spot and so I call

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,010
the janitor because I live on the

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,099
highest floor and I was afraid maybe

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,369
it's leaking from the roof who knows and

00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:34,380
then he checked and said nah it's you

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,480
you just need to air your apartment more

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,940
often then I felt like okay how often is

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,200
it like well that's pretty easy you

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,750
actually just have to avoid a dew point

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,239
and I said okay and then I looked up the

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,520
dew point I thought like oh because the

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,140
dew point is so dew point is the point

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,420
when the temperature that is the

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,640
temperature when devolved when the water

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,739
that is saluted in the air as vapor is

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,660
condensing and you know all this this is

00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,879
the when we have something cold and the

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,370
drops show up like a bottle of a

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,930
beverage whistle or a beer yeah and so

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,519
that depends on these three things

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,979
temperature air pressure and humidity

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,030
and I thought like okay I'm not going to

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,490
do all of this myself

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,040
and I thought like oh maybe I can buy a

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,049
little thingy add some kind of store

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,140
like Perot such that will remind me of

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:22,259
that and I looked up I looked him up and

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,500
yeah okay I thought I would and then

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,360
sorry I wasn't read nothing really nice

00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,369
like there was something for 30 euros

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,900
that had unfortunate blinking his play I

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,189
don't want to have a constant blinking

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,409
display in my apartment

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,420
and there was something that was kind of

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,329
better with nagisa for what that was 200

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,060
euros and I thought that is too much and

00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:43,979
so I felt like why is there nothing with

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,590
prometheus and then fr like a wait if

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,540
they sell me that shitty blinking thing

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,860
for 30 bucks they copied that expensive

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,439
and then I thought oh I'll just make one

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,590
myself and that's what I did and I chose

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,439
do those two components for very simple

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,960
reasons they're very cheap the first one

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,750
is a little ship that has Wi-Fi it's

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,399
very tiny it's very small and it costs

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,119
six dollars if you can wait three weeks

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,379
and 12 euros if you want to have it now

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,370
and the other thing is a sensor from

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,040
Bosch

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,870
that does the actual measurement and

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,340
down there that's the one I bought but

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,680
there's other ones too it's all very

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,140
cheap and readily available and I

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,900
combined these and the things that ship

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,909
has a firmware that you can build and

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,409
you actually can get custom builds that

00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:30,360
are done in a docker container somewhere

00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:33,420
in the cloud through a web interface

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,159
that was also nice to see and that

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,110
firmware is written in Aloha

00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,640
and I said modules available that you

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,140
can load so you don't have to do all the

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,420
things herself there's just nice

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,010
namely i2c which is the protocol for

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:49,410
sensors of all kinds the sensor itself

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,299
the Wi-Fi and a TCP server and then we

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,450
get to the thing this is a very limited

00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:56,519
device there is no HTTP server there's

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,980
an HTTP client that can't do very big

00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,530
requests because the RAM is very limited

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,230
this is a very small machine and so I

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:08,190
somehow stitch together a very primitive

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:10,230
thing which is essentially a TCP server

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,549
that to every connections this just

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,549
answers this and closes the connection

00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:22,560
which is almost okay it doesn't work

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:24,540
though and you can like see it here yeah

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,829
yeah you know cat is that's what it gets

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:33,950
that's the whole thing and yeah so

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:36,690
metrics so there are metrics because I

00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:39,090
I've actually been I've actually been

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,440
measuring all of us the whole time like

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:46,470
for the last few hours this is this room

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:50,250
like this is the this is the humidity

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,859
you see these large spikes here so this

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,370
is we air we enter the room we sit here

00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:57,090
for a while

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,700
you can see all of yourself sweating

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,620
you leave the room it goes down more or

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,209
less this thing is what happens when you

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,700
come over here what I did before to try

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:08,840
out the screen because over here it's

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:15,120
somehow much more humid then over there

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:17,400
and down there is the temperature which

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,609
very similar now we get to the bad news

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,260
this is the barometer it will not be as

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:26,220
nice as it was today tomorrow it's

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,320
falling consonant for hours this is now

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,690
the dew point a very good thing so this

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,820
is the temperature this is Kayla visible

00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,889
now yeah it's like the upper one is

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,780
seventeen to low one is sixteen more or

00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,030
less so as long as we don't fall below

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:43,380
that very good this room will not become

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:46,200
mouldy well I'll find what that and that

00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,820
is pretty much the thing like that's the

00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,970
whole thing if you want to play with

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,550
this this is where it resides it's

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,289
pretty hastily done please have mercy

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,789
and yes I know about the race condition

00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:00,600
with the lock things I just couldn't

00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:02,460
find the time yet to fix it well have

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,160
fun and if you want to go on yourself if

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,770
you have three weeks of patience you can

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,910
build it for 13 euros and you have to

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,910
solder four little things

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:24,880
[Music]

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,019
you
