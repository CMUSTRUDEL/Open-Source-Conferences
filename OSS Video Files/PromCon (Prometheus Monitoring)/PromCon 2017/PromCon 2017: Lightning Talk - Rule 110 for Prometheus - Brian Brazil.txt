[Music]

00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,480
hello so my name is Brian Russell and

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,910
I'm going to give you a hundred and ten

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,460
rules for paradius Julius is only able

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,570
to cover like ten so obviously just

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,730
utter teams you should be aware I was

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,349
good and bad practices and considering

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,050
that there's about 300 seconds here I

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,050
become a two and a half seconds each so

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,860
everyone's looking forward to that

00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,440
actually week nope there's a mistake

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,760
here sorry that's the wrong frog type of

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,899
who wasn't charged to see a female I

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,610
think dogs rating should have a chat

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,320
with them as I'm actually going to talk

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,309
about rule to her 10 for communities

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,170
which is very similar and so you all by

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,390
now probably know who I am I do

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,129
Prometheus stuff you know you can also

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,100
give me nice reception money if you want

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:59,219
um but if you look back to last year's

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,050
like it talks and you know I gave a talk

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,629
on the former properties of prompt ul

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,549
and you know demonstrating the prompt

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,310
you was trying to please by implementing

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:17,670
colonized life which you may remember

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:18,210
looks something like this so that's

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,460
still working

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,560
I saw it lighter when you took like a

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,150
year and a half to see it lighter anyway

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,100
but maybe you missed that or maybe you

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,490
found the talk was a little too formal

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:35,009
and so I figured let's let's go again

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:37,560
let's have another go and so rule 110

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,140
it's a linear centered cellular automata

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,909
so it's one dimensional okay whereas

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,799
life is two-dimensional so it's just

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,659
line line line line line reviewing it

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,780
where is you need to treaty structure to

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,720
look the evolution of Conway's life and

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,430
here at rules fresh so basically if the

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,810
setlist cell above me like in the

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,360
previous cell and the one left and right

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,009
we're all alive I'll be dead if the one

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,070
above me wanted to left to rely or as

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,409
rice was dead I'll be alive and so on

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,600
and if you put this down I look at the

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,670
number in binary it comes out as a heart

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,509
antenna so DeLaughter interesting rules

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,509
like seventy tree

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,170
and so how would we implement this in

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,420
front you well well we could create a

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,220
snake Patrick ones and zeros do

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,080
something costs and visualizes changes

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,760
over time use console templates again

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,310
but that's kind of being done and you

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,290
know it sounds like a lot of work but we

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,480
already have things in previous to

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,810
visualize the stage of things changing

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,730
over time like the expression browser

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:42,060
under fana so could we use that instead

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,770
so in radius to zero you know we could

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,720
have the values vary sales be zero or

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,510
one two three four and so on to

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,860
represent the actual height I mean I

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,970
still have the gaps as gaps so me

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,470
knowing it's like the four went down to

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,290
zero and then back up again that'd be

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,420
ugly and the good news is that would

00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,190
produce 2-0 stainless and changes for

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,530
nothing the expression browser we can do

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,940
that and so text very much to every

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:08,070
minute - its talking about it tomorrow

00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,230
so we're going to start small we start

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,380
and we create initialize things and it

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,990
relies the cell number one - well one

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,600
and we said that the state so firstly if

00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,580
this previous state will use it

00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,950
otherwise you basically expand left and

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,600
we initialize good news rule one zero

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,250
only ever expands left so we don't have

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,190
to worry about having less than one

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:32,640
inside the labeling and if you do that

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,810
and I kind of tweeted this out to make

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,780
you wonder what the hell that was doing

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,880
and it produces this wonderful graph you

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,140
know utterly useless as go to each true

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,410
sources like Nolan's business because

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,550
creating new time series every second

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,990
but it seems like in principle we can

00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,140
get you know the expression or browser

00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,490
to do what we watch so let's think about

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,340
how we're going to implement our rules

00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,810
well the first rule is right we need the

00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,560
Center to be true that's the current

00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,420
state unless the left rule exists so we

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,980
want to make it a big zero and not exist

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,400
and of course we need the right to be

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,340
true

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,130
nice and simple we can actually combine

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,350
a 1 1 0 and 0 1 0 because the book is

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,180
zero on the right so if you know what

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,560
kinda maps are I didn't you great use

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,440
those at all I just realized afterwards

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,209
that like if we press this down as we

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,290
have the stage and we must make sure

00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:25,320
that writers as I the left is missing

00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:28,920
correct similarly

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,930
we for 1 0 1 & 0 0 1 now here things are

00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,420
different because we don't have a center

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,130
one that we can just reuse so we just

00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,290
take the one on the right and shift it

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,180
left so that's that first one is doing I

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,630
must make sure that the distance isn't

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,280
set and then we kind of just wore those

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,170
expressions together all the other

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,600
things we want dead and well it's dead

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:52,380
so that's fine and we need initials well

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,720
to get things going and we will now show

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,190
you live what that looks like because

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:05,850
this takes about five minutes to produce

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:12,600
something useful stitch executes yep

00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:14,490
there's lots of stuff and if you look at

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,930
the Wikipedia page for a real woman zero

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:23,990
it looks very similar to - and this is

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,990
sure incomplete you can tap

00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,670
[Applause]

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,660
so as well as the backup image in case

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,389
the devil doesn't work what have we

00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,729
learned today well we have learned as

00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:42,590
you know platonic ideals exist and pom

00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:44,810
QL was turing-complete last year it's

00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,660
took during complete this year so it's

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,880
good at maths that exists and you know

00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,169
rule 110 is trying a place we could

00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,660
implement thumped well which is join

00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:55,520
completion and none of the above is in

00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,009
any way surprising to anyone who knows

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,500
what the words Turing tarpit means which

00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:02,419
also means don't use this in production

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,509
and of course news tailless semantics

00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:08,630
can be used for crazy inadvisable things

00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:12,020
the last point I hope is self-evident so

00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:15,520
I hope that was useful and so that is

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,520
the end of the lightning talks

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:30,400
[Music]

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,540
