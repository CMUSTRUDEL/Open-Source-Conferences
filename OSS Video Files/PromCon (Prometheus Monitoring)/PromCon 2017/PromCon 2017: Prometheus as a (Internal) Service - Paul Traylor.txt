Description: 
	* Abstract:

LINE is a large company with many different development teams. Momentum can be a powerful force within a company so it can take some time, training (including unlearning the old) and evangelizing to get a new system adopted. This talk will give a brief summary of our development teamâ€™s monitoring environment (Prometheus, Grafana, Promgen) before going into educating developers on Prometheus adoption and some of the struggles and lessons learned from providing Prometheus as an internal service.
