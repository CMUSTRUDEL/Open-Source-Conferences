Title: PromCon 2017: Staleness and Isolation in Prometheus 2.0 - Brian Brazil
Publication date: 2017-09-01
Playlist: PromCon 2017
Description: 
	* Abstract:

The biggest semantic change in Prometheus 2.0 is the new staleness handling. This long awaited feature means there's no longer a fixed 5 minute staleness. Now time series go stale when they're no longer exposed, and targets that no longer exist don't hang around for a full 5 minutes. Learn about how it works and how to take advantage of it.

* Speaker biography:

Brian Brazil is a core developer of Prometheus and the founder of Robust Perception. He works across the ecosystem, and is involved in areas such as best practices, exporters, PromQL semantics and client libraries.
