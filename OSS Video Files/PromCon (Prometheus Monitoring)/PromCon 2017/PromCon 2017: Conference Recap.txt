00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,589
I joined SoundCloud back in 2012 coming

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,840
from Google and what we found at

00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:30,840
SoundCloud was already a dynamic cluster

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,449
scheduler before docker or kubernetes

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,339
or so existed and we didn't yet have any

00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:37,409
monitoring tools that worked with this

00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:39,540
kind of dynamic environment we're kind

00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:42,479
of missing the way Google did its

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,790
monitoring for its own internal cluster

00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,829
scheduler and we were very inspired by

00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,659
that and finally decided to build our

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,899
own open source solution which

00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:55,019
eventually became Prometheus and allows

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,420
you to much better track metrics in a

00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:59,910
dynamic environment and ended up totally

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,630
changing the way people work and with

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,909
these environments in one eternam

00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:05,909

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,030
in 2015 I was the preferred munching

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,580
system for both custom and work and

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,440
Myrlie suggested I look at Canisius as

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,160
an alternative to the other things which

00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,870
I looked at a look at it and literally

00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,250
two days later I fell in love and have

00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,649
been really ever since

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,840
[Music]

00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:29,030
at first it was kind of mysterious but

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,460
then once we got started learning from

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:36,280
it it's real we really enjoyed it it's a

00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:38,390
very powerful third language and that I

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,049
guess would be the key strength to

00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:45,850
dicuss is that you can write queries

00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:45,850
with very little text that makes sense

00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:53,119
well first of all prometheus as the

00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:56,869
project is super well design you like

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,789
from every detail it's like everything

00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:01,220
is super thought-out and we have Brian

00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:03,850
to look after us to always make sure

00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,850
everything's consistent

00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,190
meeting people in one person and gives

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,550
you the opportunity to have those

00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:15,040
discussions generate new ideas and

00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,880
figure out new approaches to get to to

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,280
problems as well

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,320
I went to pom-pom last year there were

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,720
around 80 attendees and today we have

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,830
like 230 appendage so it's like a huge

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,210
growth that's really interesting

00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,740
everyone's really interested in the

00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,870
project

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,659
[Music]

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,970
I would try to get involved in the

00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:36,860
project as much as possible because you

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,650
learn so much from having in the

00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,019
discussions of a new github and it's the

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,480
best way to learn a project is to by

00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:46,489
contributing and it doesn't have to be

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,769
actual dough code it could also be the

00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:53,430
patience and there's a lot of areas

00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:57,110
around the project that needs help

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,110
[Music]

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,620
the one next big thing that is coming up

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:07,200
is the Prometheus 2.0 release with a

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,450
completely revamped rewritten storage

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,700
engine that improves performance across

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,590
the board overall resource types please

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,810
come to the next prompt on it's a really

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,540
great event to meet other like-minded

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:31,280
people and exchange ideas

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:31,480
[Music]

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,620
you

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,620
