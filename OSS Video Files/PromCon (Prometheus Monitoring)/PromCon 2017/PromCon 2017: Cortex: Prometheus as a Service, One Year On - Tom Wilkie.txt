Description: 
	* Abstract:

At PromCon 2016, I presented "Project Frankenstein: A multitenant, horizontally scalable Prometheus as a service". It's now one year later, and lots has changed - not least the name!  This talk will discuss what we've learnt running a Prometheus service for the past year, the architectural changes we made from the original design, and the improvements we've made to the Cortex user experience.

* Speaker biography:

Until recently, Tom was a Software Engineer at Weaveworks, where he built Cortex. Previously he was at Google as a Site Reliability Manager for Google Analytics. Before that he was Founder, VP Eng and CTO at Acunu, and before that a Software Engineer at XenSource. In his spare time, Tom likes to make craft beer and build home automation systems.
