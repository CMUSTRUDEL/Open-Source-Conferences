00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,960
I really appreciate the work you're

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,410
doing pulling this together all the

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:31,039
hours you spent working on this is it's

00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:35,989
a huge help to the community and I think

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:38,300
everyone really really like this it's

00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:39,949
hard to appreciate such words when

00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:44,239
everyone is saying it all the time for

00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:45,949
two days but I really want you to calm

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,290
down after the conference and consider

00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:48,829
this to be an excellent work you have

00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,689
done

00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:52,689

good job it is really great and

00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:44,119
well-organized just like last year just

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,149
three times bigger it's definitely the

00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,240
conference but the best food this year

00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:52,250
even though the year is not finished yet

00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,259
no and it's really we kept the community

00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,000
aspect to its it's not even though we

00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:57,470
got adopted across like all sort of

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,810
companies we still kept this community

00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:03,260
revisit and it's really good

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,380
