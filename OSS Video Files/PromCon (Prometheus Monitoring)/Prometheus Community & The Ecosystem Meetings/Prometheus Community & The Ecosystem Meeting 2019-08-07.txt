all right everyone welcome to the

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,150
Prometheus community meeting we are

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:14,400
doing one of these on a month you can

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,460
find the agenda in the document linked

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,250
and I'm I'm Matthias I work for Red Hat

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,699
path isn't able to make it today so I'm

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,460
taking over and yeah I just want to

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,170
quickly point out that we are following

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,380
the code of conduct which you can find

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,620
in Prometheus so please be aware of that

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,290
and report anything that yeah used to be

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,559
reported in private and with that being

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,840
said let's get started with some

00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:47,969
announcement the first first one is by

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:54,989
Brian on cortex go ahead yeah thank you

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:57,270
so cortex which is a long-term storage

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:02,160
implementation for Prometheus metrics

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:06,210
made its first release today it is

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,680
modestly labeled 0.1 and this after

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,580
between running in production for three

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,990
years so so the you know essentially the

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,040
story as we just didn't get around to it

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,990
but a lot of people have asked for us to

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,860
have labeled versions and they won't

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,390
take it seriously until we have that so

00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:36,119
now we have it and many thanks to Chris

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:38,909
Marchbanks who did most of the work all

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:43,200
right I guess that's it anything to add

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:46,259
to that Chris maybe or anything changed

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,899
or is it just like something you take

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,970
the version number now yeah so we have

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:53,369
version number now we're gonna do a

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,390
better job of keeping track of release

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,369
numbers or of change log entries do some

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,640
stuff into the from about the last month

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,079
into this current change log entry but

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,979
yeah check those out those are both on

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,410
github so following a very similar style

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,810
as Prometheus and by that I mean I copy

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,030
pasted most of your documentation

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,070
so thanks for writing that yeah and yeah

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:23,050
let me know or anyone else if you find

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:26,550
any issues with it and thanks gasp all

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:35,220
right cool any questions in regards to

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:38,320
this announcement all right

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:42,100
then I don't think we even have anything

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:45,220
else on the agenda this is basically now

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:48,580
time for the community to ask questions

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,950
as we have that few people I think it's

00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,900
also fine to just go ahead and start

00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:57,610
asking questions in the car and

00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,630
otherwise feel free to also use the chat

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:11,200
in the zoom collar say anything you want

00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:15,100
to discuss this is Alfred Landrum can I

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,080
just ask a question Thanks

00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,940
my name is Alfred Landrum I work at

00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,730
Cystic as an engineer on our Prometheus

00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,190
efforts I submitted a talk for prom comm

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,040
in November I just wanted to maybe ask

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:29,610
if there was any idea when we would hear

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:34,180
back on you know yes or no and on the

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,430
submissions that we made Thanks that's

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:40,150
one for me and so we're currently

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,010
working on the CFP and so the way we

00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,800
work it is that we have the all the

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,560
entries we have previous team or blanks

00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,660
and then I take them and try to make a

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,850
same schedule a - trying to make sure

00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:55,240
things are appropriately diverse in all

00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,980
the different dimensions so all going

00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,750
well I imagine we will start contacting

00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,750
people probably next week

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,950
great thank you

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,280
any other prom Connor related questions

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,880
maybe one question from me that I asked

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,150
the team maybe it's interesting for the

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,480
rest of the public to know I don't know

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,950
if you know Brian but the question that

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,450
I asked on the mailing list yesterday

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:51,850
which is there is no sponsoring catalog

00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:56,380
online yet when can we expect that to

00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:59,230
see well I believe that was fixed

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,940
earlier today okay I'm sorry about that

00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:04,000
yeah no problem like it should have been

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,130
up earlier okay well I guess we should

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,650
probably tweet it with Prometheus

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:13,680
account so everyone's aware okay thank

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,680
you

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,910
anything else related to prometheus or

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,130
as this is also called the ecosystem

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:33,330
call anything you want to ask about Corp

00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:36,290
X or prometheus operator or Donna loss

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,290
or something else

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,780
[Music]

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,639
sure actually this is my name is Ryan

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,560
Chappell I'm actually I work for VMware

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,470
and I've been working with a client

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,389
recently or using Thanos and they want

00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,169
to use the prometheus operator it's a

00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:56,729
fantastic integration Thanos you know

00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:57,930
with it with the Prometheus operator one

00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:00,030
of the things that they're trying to do

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,130
that I don't think we can do yet and I

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:05,100
have looked at the issues for Prometheus

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:07,380
operator there is a issue open about

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,820
being able to specify init containers

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,600
because one of the things that they

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:17,130
would like to do is use the vault auth

00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,750
and console template kind of in it

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,150
containers in order to pull secrets out

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,419
of vault and then inject them into the

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,890
sidecar for Thanos having in the

00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,419
containers would help that but also what

00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:30,930
that would need though is the ability to

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:34,860
define volumes because that's how those

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,110
two containers can communicate so and I

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,460
see that we have an issue for init

00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,729
containers what do we think about the

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,860
feasibility for getting one for volumes

00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:51,389
you know in the you know Prometheus

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:53,160
object doable to difficult the general

00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:57,900
the general idea about the pervious

00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:00,690
operators that we want to try to expose

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,240
the least amount of configuration knobs

00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:05,820
necessary if these are necessary I think

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,220
we can consider them I think we should

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,050
probably talk through the use case a

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,080
little bit more and see what other

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,970
solutions there could be but I think the

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,430
use case in general loading secrets from

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:20,639
ball should be is a reasonable one and

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:23,150
we should enable that in some way what

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,940
way that would be I think is discussable

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,830
but yeah feel free to maybe for the

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,340
exact you space open an issue and then

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:34,560
we could talk through it okay great yeah

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,730
cuz I've been I've been spinning on this

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,320
while trying to figure out you know

00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,480
there are ways that you can specify

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,010
containers that override the the default

00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:44,430
behavior of the thanos container that's

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:48,419
injected but I can't see a way to make

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:50,550
that the vault off and console template

00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:52,020
containers work without that without

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,419
having the ability to define volumes

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,340
because that's how they communicate yeah

00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,620
it makes sense if that's the only only

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,650
way we're gonna be able to do it then we

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:05,990
should probably add it okay yeah well

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,990
I'll put that in today thank you

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:16,530
great question anything else yeah I have

00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:18,889
a question on Mathias operator as well I

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:22,530
think recently there was some validation

00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:24,060
webhooks added for Prometheus rules to

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,270
know if there's any work adding those

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,220
for like service monitors or other types

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:43,229
as well such would there be interesting

00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:45,450
that her media's rules are especially

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:47,990
interesting because they contain prompt

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:52,680
qo and that's why we wanted to do

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:55,710
validating webhooks I'm not sure it's

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,450
entirely necessary for service monitors

00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,730
if we have a use case that can only be

00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,950
done with validating webhooks then I'm

00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,470
perfectly happy with doing that but I

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:08,610
think we should be able to cover most

00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:11,610
things via just open API schemas okay I

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:15,900
think the specific case that I've had

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:17,940
break is a relabeling configs like if

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,240
you specify a bad action or a bad

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:25,350
something and labeling configs I've had

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,360
my Prometheus break for that that'd be

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:31,080
it think admission web poker is there

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:35,010
another way around that I want to try to

00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:37,920
explore with the API machinery team if

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,810
we can have something like enum types or

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,730
enum values or something like that and

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:46,330
in the schema I would the real I would

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,250
try to avoid about

00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,820
webhooks as much as possible because

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:56,050
they are interesting and an operational

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:59,800
aspect like they're they're difficult to

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,600
get absolutely right so if we can get it

00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,240
with a steamer I would prefer that but

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,430
if there is no other way then perfectly

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,200
happy with having it okay yeah I'll look

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:17,820
into if there's any option with the

00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:17,820
schema thank you anything else

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,079
[Music]

00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,190
right them going once

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:08,410
maybe type questions if you don't want

00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,410
to ask or going twice

00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:21,710
click in the chat or make funny faces

00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:25,040
like Ben is doing made anyone typing in

00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:29,870
the chat nobody wants to talk about push

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,940
Matthias I think it would actually be

00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:36,400
cool we have some of the digital ocean

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,400
folks join us next time to talk about it

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:47,870
alright then maybe someone can reach out

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:51,080
to them and otherwise I would say have a

00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:54,440
good day and see for the next time if

00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:56,690
anyone no one is objecting to that then

00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,610
that's it for this month see you in

00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,390
September

00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,390
see y'all in September

00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,950
