hello everyone I'm Paulo Smurfs Atticus

00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:11,380
and I'm your host and this is prometheus

00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,300
and local system community meeting we

00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,880
follow Prometheus code of conduct here

00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,369
so please be nice to one another

00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,689
this is being recorded and published on

00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:24,189
YouTube

00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:27,460
today on our agenda we have someone

00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:31,509
talking about prometheus we have people

00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:34,600
from Tanis from context and from Griffin

00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:36,370
talking about cloud agent so Richard

00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,060
Channing did you recently restart the

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,670
recording it's still recording now if

00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,910
you restart at the recording I'll cut it

00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,910
I

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:59,500
okay cool so I guess we can start with

00:00:53,170 --> 00:01:03,579
Prometheus yes so the latest trees of

00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:07,330
comets is oh it is the 2.70 net and it

00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:09,430
includes mainly like isolation in TS DB

00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,760
so that you can not write a C alpha

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:16,200
scrape Alpha recording hole

00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,770
this comes with a few CPU and memory

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,930
increase but it's not that much

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,060
apparently and paper seems to be a piece

00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:29,800
that just make sure that you take the

00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:32,740
first my no reason not to 17.0 so take

00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,460
the dot one where we fixed regression in

00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,460
the performance

00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:50,280
awesome if you have any questions please

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:54,210
use the chat below I just want to add

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,280
that we actually don't have any bugs now

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,340
so we don't plant or either the two at

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,899
the moment so the two that one should be

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,899
good enough for everyone

00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:14,040
cool I guess again if you have any

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,870
question please please submit them we

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:22,130
will wait a bit for the questions and

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:22,130
then I guess move on on the next topic

00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:38,790
so we open two broken I guess yeah yeah

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:42,090
okay so for anyone who didn't see we

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:45,450
extended the CFP period for for the

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:48,870
North American edition of prom cone we

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:52,080
are fully aware that with the current

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,459
pandemic it's unclear what will happen

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,170
but still we would like to encourage

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:59,580
everyone who everyone who thinks about

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,310
submitting something just submit

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,040
something so we can so we have more to

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,080
choose from and also as of current

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,150
planning we will most likely be making

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,340
the final call on what happens around

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,880
from conan with chrome core north

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,920
america in early May of course then we

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,299
should have enough visibility of what is

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,580
actually happening with German

00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,769
restrictions and everything would we be

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,650
quarantined if travelling bla bla bla so

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:28,489
but up until that time please keep

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,489
submitting stuff

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:38,560
awesome looks like we have a bunch of

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,239
questions so first one could you post

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,459
somewhere in the docs which you need to

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,650
know before starting with meteors I

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,780
think let's maybe postpone those

00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,220
questions like after the announcements

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,079
maybe okay

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,379
it was like a point for questions even

00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:55,989
on our agenda what do you think unless

00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:59,590
it's relevant to the program maybe there

00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:03,090
is a relevant pumkin question yeah are

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:06,099
there plans to make map rongkhun and an

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:10,060
a full remote in some way if not

00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:13,269
possible otherwise currently the

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:17,590
consensus is no we would probably be

00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:20,620
looking at making some content available

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:23,860
it'd probably not be in the same time

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,110
limitations because a large a large part

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,699
of what makes prom con is the in-person

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,789
interactions and the watercooler chat

00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:32,410
and all that jazz so if we if we lose

00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:34,690
that benefit we would probably be

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:38,440
looking at making announcements and and

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,300
having talks recorded without any time

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,139
constraints but we would still be trying

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,880
to get all the all the content out which

00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:47,710
which needs to get out which is also

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,050
another reason why it makes sense to to

00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:52,750
submit to the CFP of course if you have

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,789
stuff which is worthwhile we would be

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,490
getting in contact to get this out in

00:04:54,789 --> 00:05:00,220
some way but it would not take the form

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,139
of one singular conference it might be a

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,280
series of webinars it might be something

00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:05,280
else we just don't know yet

00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:21,230
cool awesome I guess I don't see any

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:26,270
more question

00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:31,600
questions about trunk on I guess we can

00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:36,710
move on on to car tax not them take away

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:41,480
hi can you hear me yep so yeah so we

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:44,600
launched cortex 1.2 last week so cortex

00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,810
is this horizontally scalable prometheus

00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,930
api compatibility solution that you can

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,640
make all your Prometheus's send it send

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,370
their data to and you get a central

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,370
place to query things it's a four year

00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:01,340
old project and we decided to cut 1.0

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:04,280
because we realized it's ready and the

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,890
big features of 1.0 is easy to use

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,170
single binary solution so that you can

00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,670
get started with cortex on your laptop

00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,090
and also you can use the same single

00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:17,030
process solution to scale out we also

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,800
provided API and stability guarantees so

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:24,230
that you can safely upgrade without

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:27,320
breaking things and the third the third

00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,120
thing is improved documentation and

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,780
guides so we have a website cortex

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,520
matrix dot IO that you can visit and get

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,230
started and also like we have production

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,200
guides and dashboards and all of that

00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,430
published so the message around that is

00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,740
cortex has been running in production

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,410
for more than three years but if you

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,510
have been using it for like since the

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:49,640
last two years you most likely would

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:56,390
have to look at code now you don't no

00:06:49,640 --> 00:07:03,740
longer need to so that's awesome

00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:12,350
any questions around cortex being 1.0 so

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:15,680
when did you actually release it so it's

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:21,710
like 15 actually give me a second we

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:23,990
released on second yeah second awesome

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:27,190
congratulations yeah so if anyone has

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:30,620
any questions around cortex cortex one

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:33,560
good time to ask I have a question so

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:37,340
when is the party so we already

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,030
celebrated our party everyone in their

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,380
own house

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:43,970
but once the whole situation is over we

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,150
will be popping some beards somewhere

00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:57,199
hopefully yeah I wish for some ecosystem

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:58,580
part you know if you all want to travel

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,349
to Germany we can just have the party

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:06,050
here tomorrow maybe

00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:11,570
great suggestion not sure that's

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:15,380
possible all right so let's plan this

00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:18,470
offline the next party I guess anyway

00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:24,500
there are more announcements and I think

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:26,659
the next one is from Groff Anna yeah so

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,840
a few weeks ago Griffin and now

00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:32,959
Instagram oh cloud agent it so just for

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,550
some context we were trying to build

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,740
something based around the complaints we

00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:39,979
heard from Griffin oh cloud users so

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,779
mainly why do they need local storage

00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:45,230
still if all the storage is going to

00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:47,570
cortex these customers also don't really

00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,760
want to use sharding the recommended way

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,260
they'd like they like having one giant

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,209
prometheus because it's just easier to

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:57,860
configure once and aside from that we're

00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:59,660
adding more and more products so

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,150
installing a bunch of different agent

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:05,240
binaries so prom tale and Prometheus

00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:08,390
it's kind of it's not as smooth as we'd

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,520
like it to be so the idea is we are

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,440
venturing Prometheus and we are just

00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,980
using service discovery scraping and

00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,620
remote right we also add on a kind of

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,730
like a no effort sharding solution so if

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,700
you're using kubernetes service

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:25,610
discovery we're only going to scrape

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,250
know specific phrases right

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:32,209
scrape metrics that are co-located on

00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,500
the node of the agent is running on so

00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:35,490
that way you have a cluster wide

00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,709
kubernetes service discovery config

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:41,970
and you're only scraping targets from

00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:43,260
each node in the cluster and just

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,790
because we're not using any local

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,959
storage it just happens to use less

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:53,490
memory about 40% less I think is the

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,720
overhead of TS DB over time um but it's

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,320
not like a perfect solution there's some

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,380
trade-offs

00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,440
so now alerting is the responsibility of

00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,120
cortex and ruling or recording rules so

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,600
the alerts are very far away from the

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,610
targets

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,170
you're gonna lose reliability when

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:11,839
you're using this host filtering

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:15,540
mechanism like if if a node goes down

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,709
you can't get alerted on it since that

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,920
node would be monitoring itself

00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:21,570
essentially and if you move to the agent

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,209
you're also risking some vendor lock-in

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:28,580
depending on how the third party it's

00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:31,020
implementing cloud side rules and alerts

00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,120
but we've been using ourselves for a

00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:39,810
while and we're happy with it and its

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:42,540
public so please try it out it's called

00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:45,120
cloud agent we just use simple

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:50,060
Prometheus remote right so if you are

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,140
using any cloud solutions or like any

00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,570
Prometheus remote right compatible

00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,329
solutions like tano's receive em 3 DB

00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,230
Victoria metrics any solutions in the

00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:01,529
ecosystem you can still use the same

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:04,800
agent and have the same scalability and

00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:06,390
like the free sharding but given you

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,990
depend on network and an external

00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:11,640
solution yeah and the name right now is

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,579
kind of just confusing but the idea is

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,860
over time we're gonna add graphite

00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:18,329
support and low key support which is all

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,970
part of the co-founder cloud suite

00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:23,010
hence the name but when you say you

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,560
don't need lookers to get you still have

00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:27,660
a word directory right it's a very small

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,450
Wow after we've confirmed that it's been

00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:34,970
remote written we'll just drop it from

00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:37,980
the next checkpoint yes we saw the well

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,709
so it's still persistent like if remote

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,310
right server is down how long you can

00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:47,160
persist the data is there any limit or

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:49,430
can you persist main that depends how

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,350
remote right handles the right head log

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,130
no I mean like literally cortex is down

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,100
for some reason

00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:58,020
Oreo cluster is out of the network right

00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,610
I mean we're not gonna delete anything

00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,170
from the right ahead log until it's been

00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,030
remote written successfully okay so

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:07,830
let's say I have that case for a

00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:10,170
one-week then what what would happen

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,660
within prometheus no no we've been

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:16,260
tightened no I know but it's the same

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,480
question like because remote rate is

00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,920
only reading from the Wow so whatever

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,150
Prometheus says is the same thing the

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,490
agents gonna do so in prometheus what

00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:28,770
happens is after two hours we delete the

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:32,850
old data because in two hours we cut a

00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:35,820
block from the wall data so if the agent

00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:39,440
is not deleting data you likely will

00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:44,040
fill up disk yeah that's a good point

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,200
yes from eg so keep it around for six

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:52,800
hours currently three hours in the next

00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:56,070
release that we only keep it around for

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,550
two hours at least in the dogs now there

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,380
isn't some way to just lost a tiny bug

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,210
from blocks

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,800
hopefully my takeaways I need to make a

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:07,950
change so we do delete it after after a

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,290
while from the agent yeah like in

00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,790
prometheus it's all tied to the

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,950
compaction cycle and I'm guessing you

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,030
don't have one of those so you probably

00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,630
need to call it truncate every now again

00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:20,370
or something yeah hmm oh sorry

00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,350
checkpoint and then delays it's it's all

00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:26,190
the head code yeah in the truncate

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,960
function I I borrowed with heavy quotes

00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,060
the TS DB code so it's it's using the

00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:34,050
same check pointing stuff just without

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:39,630
the head blocks this is good because

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:41,550
that's very good my question is like you

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,130
are adding graphite and maybe I don't

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:47,460
know maybe prom tale to this or whatever

00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:49,290
like do you want to have a separate kind

00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,120
of components for that or like from code

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,720
perspective you try to embed it within

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,860
the world is DB it's they're not gonna

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,540
interact with each other it's

00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:04,040
essentially gonna act as like an uber

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:04,040
binary okay make sense thank you

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:10,310
so the intention behind is it's

00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:12,810
basically to to account for

00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:17,340
organizational stuff within customer

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,480
companies it's not so much yeah so

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,100
that's basically the underlying

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,230
intention that also gives you a

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,590
direction of where the whole thing will

00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,590
develop

00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,840
right perfect we have ten minutes left

00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,580
so let's move on if you still have

00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,680
questions feel free to drop them in the

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:41,280
chat or and a question and answer

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,350
section but we yeah we have ten minutes

00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,290
and three questions so I think Bartek

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:48,600
know Lukas sorry go ahead and do your

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:51,540
announcement cool

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,250
hey so I'm Lukas I'm one of the

00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,880
commentators and I just want to give an

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:58,680
update about the new Thomas release that

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,540
we've been working on for the last while

00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:06,960
we just cut the second release candidate

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:10,440
so that's our see one of our version 0.0

00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,670
0.0 of thumbs and I just want to give a

00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,200
little bit of an overview of the new

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:17,160
things that we're adding to Sano's in

00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:19,890
this iteration firstly one of the main

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,840
things we've done is that um we've

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,630
enabled the ability to do vertical

00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,910
compaction or offline do deduplication

00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,980
of blocks and object storage so this

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,480
like will greatly improve clearing speed

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,340
and reduces resource consumption when

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,870
you're querying for metrics that are in

00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,880
blocks that are ingested by autonomous

00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,560
receive with replication enabled so if

00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,780
you have a hash ring of receivers and

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,190
they're replicating maybe three times

00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,720
all the data ingest and you end up with

00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,700
three copies of all the blocks in your

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,200
objects origin deduplicating this will

00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:51,450
like massively improve your query

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:54,330
performance we also have promoted our

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,010
new index header operation mode for the

00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:00,240
bucket store to the default also making

00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:03,210
our stores much more efficient and less

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,190
resource hungry and we also added a

00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:10,800
bunch new UI changes specifically we

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:12,720
enabled the bucket web UI on the store

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,250
and the compactor and this means that

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,920
now you can when you're running the

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,150
store you can see all of the all of the

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,850
blocks at the store in the compact are

00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:23,070
actually loading use when you navigate

00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,570
to slash loaded and on the compactor you

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:29,880
can see all of the blocks that are in

00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:31,380
the bucket at slash global we also fixed

00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,690
a really really nasty bug in the store

00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:36,690
that cost all of the posting offsets

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:40,160
rather than just like a subset of them

00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:42,950
like 1/32 of these offsets to get loaded

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,180
and this like this bug number one it was

00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,350
there was a correctness issue and it

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,180
caused some problems but it also like

00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,400
significantly reduces memory utilization

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,650
like insanely and we want to give like

00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,410
special thanks to my cobby chef and

00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:58,640
dmitry ulianov um who helped out in the

00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:00,980
community super hardcore and then yeah

00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,110
we have a bunch of other things like um

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,230
a new strict operation mode for the

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:08,360
bucket store that does enable strict

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,630
handling of healthiness to give like

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:16,130
better response caching and also like

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:17,870
airing error handling and stuff so yeah

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,430
those are some of the the main things

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,620
we've done I mean serration and

00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:24,199
hopefully if everything is stable we'll

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:27,490
soon be able to cut the official release

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,490
in the next few days or the next week

00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,350
all right

00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,800
due to time please put your questions in

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:38,450
the chat and the Q&A so let's move on

00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,670
because we still have two topics and I

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,430
think next one Bartek you want to say

00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,740
something Bartok and I have been sick

00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:49,030
observability voted or maybe Ricci I

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,030
don't know who put this in here so

00:17:50,170 --> 00:18:00,110
there's a CNCs observability working

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:05,570
group or like a sick and that has been

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:09,350
accepted by the yes exactly and so last

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:11,570
Monday the TLC voted us in yesterday it

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:15,380
was confirmed officially as an order is

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:18,350
a sicko observability within C & C F mad

00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:22,580
yummy our chairs we will still need to

00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:24,710
select delete the current the current

00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:29,420
person who is most likely to be the

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:31,460
first tech lead is our tech and cortex

00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,940
was the only project to submit this

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,680
yearly house thingy as of right now that

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,440
is most likely the first thing we will

00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,910
be looking at within this league there

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,630
will be a mailing list there is already

00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:46,940
a selection on the CNC F slack and we

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,130
will also publish a cadence of course

00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:52,270
and such so anyone interested this

00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,270
morning welcome to John

00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:02,800
awesome news yeah awesome news

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,680
yeah if you have any questions I think

00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,590
we still can run a bit over because we

00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:12,060
start that later so yeah yeah if you

00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,060
have any questions please submit them

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:18,280
yeah I think we can move on

00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,760
on the next pick the new benchmark

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,590
Desmond yeah so the benchmark dashboard

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,240
which I originally created because I was

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,580
benchmarking Prometheus one point

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,310
something I haven't updated in the year

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,750
I just updated it this morning now this

00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,310
is actually an absolutely terrible

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,170
example of a dashboard because it has

00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,970
over 50 perhaps lunch and it is

00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,490
completely understandable unless your

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,680
media developer however if you're trying

00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,850
to get assistance from the radius

00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,860
developers and are having a performance

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,600
problem and including a profound a

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,280
snapshot of this will make the

00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,040
communities developers life's much much

00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,020
easier because it is all the core

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,370
processes are these everything metrics

00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,220
for which should be everything because

00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:59,590
Prometheus yeah it'll help to understand

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,970
what's going wrong if something is going

00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:03,340
wrong and where a performance problem is

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,990
but that's just very useful for general

00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,660
debugging if you're looking for help

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,970
either yourself or from Commedia steam

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:13,210
or the broader community and the link is

00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:16,350
in the meeting notes itself because I'm

00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,350
not going to attempt the screen here

00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:22,210
all right perfect yeah please refer to

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,320
the to the meeting notes which are

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:29,560
titled

00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:32,350
by 8th of April 2020 all right so I

00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,640
think Ben had a question I think like if

00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:37,060
there are no direct questions from

00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,790
anyone directly at the benchmark

00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,410
dashboard we can just move on and people

00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,480
can still put questions into the

00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:47,050
question section and the doc argument in

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,600
the chat here but then let's move on

00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,900
like Ben I think you are able to talk so

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:56,230
go ahead ask a question yeah no I just

00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,840
had a quick random idea which was I was

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,330
digging through our build flags and

00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,420
noticed that we don't have built flags

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:05,800
on the discovery components and I was

00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:11,290
wondering if there would be any

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:16,150
objection to adding say no zookeeper and

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:18,280
no kubernetes and etc build flags so if

00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,040
I want to build a Prometheus server for

00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,050
more memory constrained embedded use I

00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,720
could build it with just enough service

00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:28,930
discovery for my embedded use and also

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:34,210
maybe other come other parts of the of

00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:37,270
the binary like embedded Prometheus so I

00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:41,110
think that if you remove if you remove

00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:44,770
Asia you will cut the binary by to the

00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:46,660
size I mean yeah so this is actually a

00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,490
long-standing and we've discussed this

00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,250
at a few deaths someone sitting to last

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,870
one was two three years ago so I have to

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:56,820
find the issues but my recollection is

00:21:52,870 --> 00:22:00,400
that we a priority we've mostly Bartek

00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:02,350
was going to split and refactor tings so

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,730
that you could do this and it should be

00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,250
more like how the node Explorer works

00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,440
and so on and I think we've gotten most

00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,330
of the way to towards factoring that so

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,490
that everything doesn't depend on one

00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:14,530
like Bluebird constructor but the final

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,610
steps haven't been done and I guess this

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:17,050
is something where a community could

00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,830
help and finally breaking those

00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:22,810
dependencies and at that point and it

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:26,680
doesn't seem utterly unreasonable to

00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:28,180
have bid build flags there oh yeah we

00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,520
need some kind of like register

00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,130
constructor in there as well

00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,950
I didn't

00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:36,590
think about that config needs to be

00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,000
broken out like by now everything's

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,040
moved out of the central come fake

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,390
package and most that's nothing gets

00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,160
treated across the codebase but then

00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,860
that needs to be done recursively for

00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:49,490
each of the discoveries and if someone

00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:51,500
does that work then later on we can Dan

00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:54,830
out build but right now we've just

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:57,320
cause Prometheus mm pop yeah I fully

00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,790
agree I would because we were looking on

00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,830
some because the session is a plugin

00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:03,820
problem right and we are looking on

00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:06,920
various solutions on Ingo ecosystem and

00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:09,200
we are really going into the erection of

00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:12,170
the core DNS plugins so we should look

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:16,910
on them is essentially build based type

00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:19,100
of plugins so you can not only kind of

00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:23,000
we can not only like fix it from the

00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:24,560
build size kind of side of it but also

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,690
we could you know allow you know

00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,880
separate remote I know some kind of

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,370
interface that what that we could add

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,410
plugins outside of primitives repository

00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:36,470
of stuff so we could make it you know

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:38,780
plugin about truly so this is like a

00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,840
good opportunity maybe to look on that

00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,730
so I would look on Don Cardenas wagons I

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,380
point out that such things have been

00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,420
discussed before and are contentious

00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,920
like I personally do not want to read

00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,930
party code running inside the freakiest

00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,390
binary because we have enough support

00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,740
problems as it is and but like if people

00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,830
want compile their own Prometheus from

00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:00,500
scratch because some stuff sure but

00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:02,900
having third parties running code today

00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,880
themselves didn't write is a different

00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,290
level of support which done you know we

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:12,530
have enough problems debugging issues as

00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:15,590
it stands unfortunately it's been right

00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:18,230
so I'm I'm also a contributor and

00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:20,420
maintainer of Cordy Ness and the plugin

00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:25,370
system there works really reasonably

00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:27,290
well it is a little hard for some of the

00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:30,740
plugins to keep up with the upstream

00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:32,360
plug-in interface and so we should be a

00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,630
little more careful than the core DNS

00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,940
developers were in setting up the the

00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:41,360
event the interface for how a plugin

00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:44,370
gets added I there was several times

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,450
where I actually it it took to you

00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:51,049
to get one plugin that was external

00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:56,400
updated in order to actually get it

00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:57,510
compiled able again yeah

00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,429
well thankfully if they use different

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,620
oaken terms of service discovery those

00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:05,909
api size the exist haven't changed into

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:08,340
goat well yeah so i'm of course making

00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:10,440
learn essence from other projects but

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,059
right now the interface is chuck it on

00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,830
disk she doesn't have that problem but

00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:15,600
these are trade-offs we can discuss them

00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,580
at the next dev so much see if the

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,710
trade-offs and change but anyway the

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:23,279
action item used to first fix the config

00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:25,700
package we should probably elaborate on

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,600
the github issue or something yeah

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,529
there's an issue that's been open for

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,870
two three years already

00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:35,130
yeah so let's update with the latest I

00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:37,559
guess sorry I think this is a perfect

00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:40,320
like example of what has been discussed

00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:42,450
behind doors kind of or not behind doors

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,919
but like somewhere hidden in all the

00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:47,899
discussions that are happening kind of

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,220
right but we have more questions so I

00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:52,919
recommend everybody kind of trying to

00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,169
follow the discussion and then let's

00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,970
move on but I think we like there's room

00:25:55,169 --> 00:25:57,510
for a discussion at the next step summit

00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,789
for sure

00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:00,840
because we have two more questions

00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:02,760
coming in right now

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,250
and I would want to read the one by

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,840
Mario and here if you are new to

00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,640
prometheus and potentially need

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,830
long-term storage how do you decide

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,350
between Thomas and cortex for non clouds

00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:15,210
I currently lean towards cortex just

00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:19,200
because it supports Cassandra and is

00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:20,580
free and it reached b1 and now you just

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,020
answered the question I can't read it

00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,069
anymore

00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,069
[Music]

00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:31,559
yeah first of all I think the best

00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:35,580
answer I can give you is go to the

00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:38,429
premiere prom Khan videos the recorded

00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,950
videos there was a talk by Bartok and

00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:43,980
and Tom and the differences between both

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,539
storage long-term storage systems but

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,860
maybe in partake and got them want to

00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:52,049
quickly say something I don't know yeah

00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,970
first of all why tell us his

00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:57,809
experimental local storage that's good

00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,320
I'm curious anyway I think maybe you

00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:00,779
mean that

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,470
cortex has a experimental block storage

00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:06,779
maybe I know but anyway like that's a

00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:09,990
good question to be honest we are trying

00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:12,750
to with the community propose we already

00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:16,590
proposed various talks for next prom con

00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:18,899
about that so definitely stay tuned and

00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,850
yeah we're definitely working on some

00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:23,399
case studies and like realistic

00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:26,309
deployments for certain requirements

00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:28,620
where you should go with what there's

00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:30,179
definitely lots to choose from so the

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,690
best way is to start both and just

00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:36,570
explore but obviously some good

00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:38,580
documentation on you know experience is

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,039
something very useful so we'll be

00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,899
working on that and some user stories

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:46,740
more for sure from both cortex and Dino

00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:49,289
sites yeah and yeah Thomas won't stop of

00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:52,799
Cassandra so if that's your choice then

00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:55,350
your choice is easy yeah okay follow up

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,080
on the file system there's a file system

00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:00,360
driver for Thanos which seems which is

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,750
experimental cuz that's for testing but

00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:06,480
the general th DB support is is not

00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:12,299
experimental and exactly the same that's

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:14,399
used I guess that you can run Mineo to

00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:17,190
have an s3 interface that you can use

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,200
against Thanos and I would say that

00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:21,509
Thanos is just as production radius

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,389
cortex we just cut one or two because we

00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:27,529
are confident that we won't break things

00:28:23,389 --> 00:28:30,090
but like Thanos is also production-ready

00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:38,070
cool I want to talk about context

00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:41,130
advantages would do you want to

00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:43,590
car packs a little bit or no so I I just

00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:45,240
linked the talk that kind of compare

00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:49,590
stano's and quartets and when to use

00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:52,590
what and also okay I can I can also add

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:56,790
that we are embedding the tano's storage

00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:58,500
engine in context so like hopefully in

00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,780
the future you can start out with one

00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:07,190
and move to the other if the trade-off

00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:07,190
change to the contour for the trade-offs

00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:15,090
cool I guess we have one more question

00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,800
so it's from Alexander slightly of

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:19,470
thought become using the Prometheus

00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,570
operator for a while now currently I'm

00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,970
promoting more ad use usage of

00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:26,640
kubernetes within my team and the

00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:31,050
friends issue is that there are some

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:36,240
components not working on our v6 v7 and

00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:38,490
I'm 64 config map preload question are

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:45,360
there efforts to push my edge topics in

00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:47,610
general and 487 64 in specific yeah so I

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,850
actually worked on this for my cube con

00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:53,490
talk where I deployed Prometheus and the

00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:56,160
entirety of Prometheus stack on on a

00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,810
Raspberry Pi and I know exactly the

00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,760
problems around this I think there's an

00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:03,750
issue on the prometheus operator and

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,060
they're like two containers that we need

00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:09,270
to part to arm but like Prometheus

00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:12,240
itself alert manager and a bunch of

00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:14,760
others are already multi arch so you can

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,370
you can start using them feel free just

00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,910
to to like search for exactly that topic

00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:23,760
on the Prometheus operator repo and it's

00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:26,340
literally just like making updates to

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,830
the make file and the docker files and

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,740
and such and then that's that's it like

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:35,550
that's also all that I had to do for for

00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:37,530
my cube con talk but yeah I wasn't able

00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:40,200
to push through it in my free time kind

00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:42,920
of exactly so had appreciated and

00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,920
welcome

00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:51,159
call anyone and anyone else has any

00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:56,330
opinion on one spot for Prometheus and

00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:58,970
other tools I mean we try to support

00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:01,639
those right and I think we'll continue

00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:04,909
at least for 64-bits

00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:09,429
systems I don't know if it's you if it's

00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:11,840
useful to pursue their 32 and I mean for

00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:14,840
Prometheus itself you just like deploy

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,779
it on on a Raspberry Pi or even on like

00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,639
a k3s cluster and it just puts down the

00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:23,029
correct image from from the registry

00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:25,789
like there's little you need to do like

00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:28,279
compared to running it on on AMD 64 so

00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:30,320
for Prometheus itself that's fine the

00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:33,350
question is like rather specific to the

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,789
Prometheus operator yeah like for for

00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,859
Metis itself it should be noted that

00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:39,559
running at 32 pitch will probably not

00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:42,379
end well because as our fruit is - we M

00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:44,149
up a lot and as of like the index

00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:47,929
optimizations was just an just picked up

00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:49,429
we a map even more so like your total

00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:51,919
data size has to be less than probably

00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:54,679
like 500 Meg's these days for it to work

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,169
on 32-bit but this only applies to

00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:59,720
preemies itself all other components in

00:31:57,169 --> 00:32:02,059
the ecosystem I imagine I guess probably

00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,710
tunnels as well but older non storage

00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:05,700
components should be fine Maternity of

00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:08,440
it

00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,000
all right perfect

00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,070
I think that's all the time we have

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,549
actually so I want to thank everybody

00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:17,379
showing up for today's call I'm super

00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:19,899
glad that so many people joined after

00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:22,450
last week's failed attempt and we still

00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:25,029
had like 30 people in the car

00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:27,580
super-good updates and news and great

00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:30,250
work the community is doing and yeah

00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:33,250
with that I hope to see everybody next

00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:35,529
month actually in three weeks

00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:38,200
because we needed to move it one week

00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:42,330
right so that's gonna happen a bit

00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:45,519
earlier in in three weeks for people in

00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:48,250
APEC to be able to join as well but

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:53,019
that's fine social isolation makes us

00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:55,480
more productive right I guess alright

00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:58,559
then stay safe stay healthy and see you

00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:02,669
in three weeks thanks everybody

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,669
