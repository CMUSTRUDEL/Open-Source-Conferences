um

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,880

um be nice to each other we are

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,640
following the cncf code of conduct

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,960
um and with that i don't think there is

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,360
anything i have to say uh julian

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,000
you want to go and talk about a new

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,480
prometheus

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,719
release yes we have released promoting

00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,760
2.25

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,120
with multiple big features like the

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,760
remote write receiver and

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,600
the attempt setting from ql there there

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,440
were a lot of other changes

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,879
and like it was released two or three

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,280
weeks ago and

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,080
we did not get any buggy new book

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,640
reports

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,799
yet about it so it seems like this is

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,200
gonna be a good release and i encourage

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,000
you to update

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,560
and for the next three days which will

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,560
come this month so before the next

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,520
community call we will probably have a

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,280
new service discovery which is scaleway

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,960
which is called provider

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,280
and also probably we will have the

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,000
exemplar support coming in the coming

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,400
weeks so i hope to to get that

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,880
before the next release so we can play

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,880
with that

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,200
very good stuff thanks for the update

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,000
um so yeah update to the latest version

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,720
then

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,840
um i think richie isn't here

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,560
um gene do you want to do this as well

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,240
then

00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,360
because you initially put it in yes

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,399
so the next prom con will happen

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,040
in may and basically like we are in the

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,679
cfp phase until friday so we

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,760
we have a short cfp because like we are

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,239
aligned with kubecon

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,280
so i encourage all of you to submit your

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,040
talks to

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,200
to the cfp so we are welcoming

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,640
the list of the topics is in the cfp

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,920
itself anything that we

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,239
would accept and basically like after

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,520
that

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,000
you will have like i think

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,000
two or three weeks to record after you

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,120
are accepted to record your presentation

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,400
because it's a virtual event

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,599
so that's it so please submit your talks

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,720
before friday if possible and then

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,760
we will do the review soon after that

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,519
deadline

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,599
thank you

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,599
awesome i think you can just continue

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,599
yeah i don't know if bartek is there but

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,159
i don't see

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,680
him but basically like we have got

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,599
reports from the community that

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,080
some people want to join the country

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,319
with the robots from multiple time zones

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,319
so now instead of doing that in the

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:19,840
evening in europe we are splitting that

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:19,840
into different diamonds

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,149
um

00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,149
[Music]

00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,200
[Music]

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,280
um so i guess yeah like split the

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,200
prometheus contributor office hours into

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,120
two time zones so everybody

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:54,640
like from uh america as well as

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,080
uh more like asia countries can

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,439
uh can join and participate and i think

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,720
that's that's really great

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:06,239
um so i guess it starts

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,680
from this week onwards similar to

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,760
to this called 10 am utc and 5 pm utc so

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,280
if you can make it to this one um i'm

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,560
pretty sure you can make it to

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,799
the other ones if you if you're

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,479
um able to and i think we just got

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,280
julian like we completely asked you

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,759
there so i

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,600
just quickly talked about the prometheus

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,479
contributor office our split

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,919
so if you want to do the next topic um

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,639
feel free

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,680
yes so we have released the last art

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,199
manager

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,080
in june i think but like we have

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,280
we will do a new release probably this

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,199
month

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,199
in the big feature we have time-based

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,720
muting so that you can mute the alert

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,520
based on the time directly in the art

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,320
manager

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,600
i like to do like uh holidays and that

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,160
kind of things

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,639
and also negative matches for alerts

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,720
which means

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,800
for silence history which means that

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,720
like you can now create a silence for

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,600
like non-fraud or that kind of thing

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,240
instead of needing to silence everything

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,199
but

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,039
so this is like quite a nice improvement

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,720
to the silence that has been done and it

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,199
was like a big work because like you

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,520
know

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,680
there is the api there is the engine and

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,320
there is the ui that needs to be updated

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,240
but like

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,400
this is now all coming together and it

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,039
should be really ready this month and

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,440
like we

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,320
could release candidate in the coming

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,360
weeks and

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,080
i'm quite excited about it and of course

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,680
like over

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,759
the last nine months we also have a lot

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,759
of bug fixes and improvements as well

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,680
awesome thank you for the long list of

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,720
updates

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:47,520
um ben i think you

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:50,639
want to talk about the postgres exporter

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,000
yeah so we just added another uh adopted

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,560
another project into the prometheus

00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,240
community uh github org so now we have

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,000
the um uh postgres exporter that was

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,479
the most popular community maintained

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
one um there's quite a lot of work to

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,240
catch it up to

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,400
our normal build and release process but

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,600
we've made the first release of 0.9

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,600
which is basically

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,639
cutting the the current release as is

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
but with

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,160
uh all the the usual previous build

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,520
process

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,720
uh next up is

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,840
uh adding multi-target support so that

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,960
you can use it against rds

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,880
more easily and other similar

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,039
situations where you have a an

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,960
externally managed postgres if you can't

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,240
local localhost deploy the postgres

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,759
exporter

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,840
um and then uh yeah i

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,960
also just want to mention what there is

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,319
quite a lot of projects from the

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,919
prometheus community

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,479
uh we're always looking for more

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,599
contributors even if it's just answering

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,919
uh uh bug requests and other

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,599
other issues on the uh in the issue

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,280
trackers for each of these

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,280
uh features so if you care about

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,240
postgres uh please contribute to the

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,240
postgres exporter

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,400
good time for anyone to update what's

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,759
running on postgres instance somewhere

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,960
that's for sure um

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,960
all right cool uh before we get into the

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,840
ecosystem updates uh i saw rishi joined

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,919
we already

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,120
touched the prom con topic anything to

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,840
add besides the

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,240
cfp deadline is in two days

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,960
and mainly it um as you will have

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,840
noticed

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,000
um we we are co-locating with kubecon

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,039
this time as a bit of an experiment and

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,199
a throwback to

00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:48,800
2016 when we had a prometheus day

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:51,360
in seattle and we just see how it goes

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,280
we might or might not do a second

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,000
program later in the year

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,560
depending also on user feedback and such

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,479
so

00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,919
by all means please tell us how you

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,840
liked it with the

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,680
co-location or didn't like it or

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,879
whatever of course

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,000
experiment um and please submit

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,400
to the cfp like we told you it's closing

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,319
but

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,440
please actually submit course we are

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,479
falling into this

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,039
thing where people don't really

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,720
apply for online conferences for all the

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,000
wrong reasons but like i get it

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,440
i have the same thing yet on the plus

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,080
side this means it's easier for you to

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,759
get content

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,759
in if you if you want to

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,479
if you want to submit so this is

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,959
actually a plus for anyone

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,680
who has a story which they want to tell

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,320
and if you

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,080
if you need some some help with

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,240
sharpening talks or something

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,120
we have done this as part of of

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,040
community outreach a lot of times

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,880
so if if you have an interesting topic

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,399
but need a little bit help in

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,399
in polishing your thing talk to us

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,279
right awesome um yeah so

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,959
definitely definitely think about

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,560
something and

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,880
and apply awesome thank you

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,839
richie then let's continue with the prom

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,120
migrator

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,120
um whoever put that in

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,920
hello everyone um good morning and good

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,720
afternoon uh i am hard kishin

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,800
and me and vinit will talk about um calm

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,640
migrator from skill and tops

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,040
i'll give updates about from migration

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,160
and from scale and then fast forward to

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,600
for photos to beneath so um

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,600
with the intro from migrator

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,160
is um data migration tool for prometheus

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,480
data where you can migrate data from any

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,320
from each remote storage to any other

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,959
permission simulation or

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,880
ometers local data to any remote source

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,440
system or from ats

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,080
so this tool is like immune to failures

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,680
which means

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,880
um it can resume the migration process

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,360
from where it left off

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,640
and at the same time it can concurrently

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,720
pull and push data to

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,240
multiple storage systems so that the

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,839
throughput of data migration can be

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,680
faster

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,440
for more information we have a blog post

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,920
on this which explains about

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,680
the project and the limitations this

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,360
link of the blog post is mentioned

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,800
inside the

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,240
prometheus community meet doc and

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,000
right now we have released a beta

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,640
version of from migrator and we are

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,600
looking for

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,600
more feedback on it

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,040
and talking about um from scale we

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,200
release a 0.2 version of from scale

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,120
which supports

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,279
multi-node in time scale db which is

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,760
horizontal scalability and then

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,959
this version has improved from ql query

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,279
latency which is

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,279
up to almost four four times the

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,959
previous performance

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,200
then we are also working on a new um

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,800
high availability method which is which

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,120
will be released in the upcoming release

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,600
of

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,720
from scale and this is inspired from

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,440
cortex

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,200
this new method will also enable you to

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,120
scale from scale independently based on

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,600
your requirements

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,200
further the new release has features

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,720
like um

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,399
the added modifier which was added

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,959
recently in prompt scale

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,640
for in from ets and this is by default

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,959
disabled

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,560
and the release also contains various

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,760
fixes and improvements

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,959
some like created to postgres vacuum or

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,079
vacuum stuff and i think that's about

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,680
from scale and another call beneath

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,399
for uh updates on tops

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,079
so hello everyone so we at time scale

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,560
have been working on an observability

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,200
suit

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,959
called tops so currently the tops

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,200
project only supports

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,959
monitoring so you just need this stops

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,880
install and it installs the monitoring

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,160
suit in your kubernetes cluster

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,399
and it also provides full life cycle

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,680
command such as if you want to change

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,360
your password or

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,920
config the update the configurations and

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,839
prometheus config so yeah we have

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,040
released a new blog post on how does the

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,720
project

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,480
work and what is what does the future

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,760
hold for the talks

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,200
and we also support added a feature like

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,560
you can connect to an external time

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,720
scale db like

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,160
you have manage time scale if you just

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,480
give the

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,000
url and it just gets connected all you

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,519
have is the scraping

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,200
things and the prometheus in your

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,000
kubernetes cluster and

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,760
also we are currently looking in the uh

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,839
working on the ways to integrate cube

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,079
prometheus with us so currently

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,240
uh in tops prometheus doesn't support h

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,240
a we are just using the

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,560
the default prometheus helen chart which

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,120
has the cube state matrix and node

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,680
node exporter as add-ons but we are very

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,600
much

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,040
interested in adding q prometheus as

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,720
add-on to tops

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,120
so yeah we are we are currently

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,399
evaluating the helm charts and json

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,240
and how to integrate it into tops

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,240
yeah that's the update

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,240
awesome uh thank you for the

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,360
three projects you just talked about

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,639
it's quite a list

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,360
um yeah i think

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,519
it sounds good and we can continue with

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,120
the prometheus operator

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,040
i think probably wanted to talk about

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,079
this

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,800
yeah so as for prometheus operator um

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,519
we just released the new release zero

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,760
forty six

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,880
zero this is primarily a stability

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,160
release

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,600
uh but to mention some main points we

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,480
dropped support from

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,839
for prometheus one dot x that's a blast

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,040
from the past

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,959
and we also created an adopters md file

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,040
and looking for companies that actually

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,760
are using prometheus operator to share

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,440
their

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,839
um their setups

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,440
also on cube prometheus side as the

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,600
project was already mentioned

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,079
um we switched the default branch to

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,279
main

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,320
following the prometheus but did the

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,480
same

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,480
and the culture factoring that i was

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,600
announcing in i think january

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,720
is now complete and we are looking for

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,120
users to migrate to a new setup

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,399
and the migration guide uh pointing out

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,560
our major changes

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,480
uh is also described versus link in the

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,320
in the document for that

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,120
we are also working on the battery ux

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,079
for the project um we identified that uh

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,560
it might be very hard to start with the

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,120
project

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,040
and to use it since it's uh quite a lot

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,160
of json code which might be

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,480
not familiar for many people so we are

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,360
we are working on something that is uh

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,320
that should be

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,800
solving that issue with uh more familiar

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,480
tools

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,399
and we are very uh very fond of we're

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,480
looking for we are looking forward to

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,480
work with tops on on the project

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,480
all right um thanks power for the update

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,920
um

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:07,440
it seems like this it had a emoji

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,079
um by top spontaneous i'm glad you're

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
here

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:14,160
um all right um i

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:18,720
think the last point would be networking

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,720
and as an mp etc

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,160
yep yes megan

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,440
so many of you will have seen the

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,079
document

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,079
i would invite the widest possible

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,079
feedback if you care about networking

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,600
which more and more people

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,320
in the premises ecosystem do so fyi

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,079
both ben and i plan to break a lot of

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,920
parts about how snmp

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,240
worked in the past we made a safe harbor

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,880
release

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,320
for snmp exporter for anyone who depends

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,199
on the old style of working

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,880
and then we are planning to to break how

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,519
the conflict works and break a few other

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,720
things everything is listed as linked in

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,600
the document

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,120
so if you want to work on that or if you

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,680
have

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,120
users or people you know or yourself are

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,839
interested in networking

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,839
give it a read

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,120
all right thanks richard um

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,000
okay i think that's pretty much it i

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,199
don't know if there are

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,720
any questions um regarding

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,720
anything we already talked about

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,759
give you a couple of seconds you can

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,759
also drop them in the chat if you want

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,720
to

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,680
seems everything was fully

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,920
understandable

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:47,199
and super clear at the same time

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,600
um i i want to add that we had last week

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,800
our developer summit

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,360
for the prometeus project

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:59,279
and i think that the recording should be

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,279
on youtube now if i'm correct

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,320
i already watched it

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,079
so yeah maybe we can drop the link in

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,000
the in the document

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:12,000
as well okay which is on it okay good

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:19,760
okay she wanted to say something

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,559
i'm just yes i'm linking the video as we

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,280
speak

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,039
i'm just looking for it and yes clearly

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,000
you are why that now it's open to the

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,679
public

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,919
we send the announcement to the point is

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,600
developers mailing list

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,200
for the moment it's the last third day

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,200
of the month at 3 pm

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:42,000
european 3 pm utc yes

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,919
all right i think people are interested

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,440
that's really good feedback so they can

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:54,640
plan ahead and join next time uh

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,280
awesome richie dropped the link there's

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,200
a

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,600
playlist which i will link in the

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,080
document so you can i think you can

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,640
subscribe

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,000
to just a playlist in youtube somehow so

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,919
if you only

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,280
playlist you can also subscribe to the

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,320
leader

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,720
that makes sense but also this uh these

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,600
uh

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,080
meetings uh should should be landing on

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,760
the same

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,280
youtube channel so you can just

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,919
subscribe to everything

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,919
i'm just saying

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,480
all right anything else um

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,640
actually that's a good point we

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,520
discussed this within team recently

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,320
um so we are experimenting with putting

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,360
more

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,240
content on the youtube channel of

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,320
prometheus and i would love to see more

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,480
thanos content as well

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,559
what what do the non-prometheus team

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,480
members on this call think does it make

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,320
sense for prometheus to

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,000
for the prometheus channel to also

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:57,840
publish stuff about

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,840
friendly projects or is this a diversion

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,840
i'm not speaking up as fono's maintainer

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,799
so

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,000
maybe we can make like a poll somewhere

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,520
like uh

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,280
maybe twitter poll i know there are a

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,160
bunch of people who aren't on twitter

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,840
but

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,080
it might be able to give us like a rough

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,559
idea

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,679
lily is asking how do you choose which

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,679
ones qualify

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,200
prometheus family and i know that family

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,720
is a contentious word

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,559
but basically projects which are

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:44,720
near to prometheus by by their history

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,120
and acts in the past so

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,080
i would see for example cortex thanos

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,160
openmetrics

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,640
i would say that things like the

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,480
operator cubesat matrix

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,760
all those things which are historically

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,200
super near to

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,440
prometheus are part of this but if we

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,919
find other stuff to experiment with i

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,840
think

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,840
more is better than less um

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,640
i mean the the counter argument uh which

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,679
i know making for frederick

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,120
is that it dilutes a little bit um so

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,880
that is that is the counter

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,960
consideration

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,919
um which i also think is a fair point

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,720
but i think on

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,159
on balance but yeah this is not about

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,480
discussing

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,240
or rehashing the team discussion it's

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,559
about getting feedback from what

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,559
the people support to the thing want

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,480
not having participated in the previous

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,120
discussion

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,919
and yes i'm the thanos maintainer i

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,520
generally

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:51,200
see that probably a bit more activity is

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,400
possible with the prometheus youtube

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,080
channel so

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,880
i don't see like a reason not to

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,559
put more on there because it's been

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,960
pretty pretty quiet

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:08,799
so um that's just as far as my opinion

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,120
um so

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,480
what the actual scope is we can discuss

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,000
offline i guess but

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:19,360
um and kind of like

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,280
i'm thinking that probably um

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,880
yeah there's like room for more content

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:31,840
because it's quite quite quite a

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,840
little i don't know yeah

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,120
all right anything else

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,520
all right i think then let's give

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,640
everybody

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:53,520
a few minutes back and see you in

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:56,559
april uh for a call at 5 p.m i think

00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:00,320
utc um remember to

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:03,840
submit prom con proposals if you want to

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,240
to do a talk uh update to the latest

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,559
prometheus version because it's awesome

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,240
and check out all the rest people we're

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,799
talking about

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,799
all right have a great week bye

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,200
