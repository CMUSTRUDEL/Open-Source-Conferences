00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,640

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,840

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,880
yeah so everybody proposed talks that's

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,040
how it works

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,200
um and then the ecosystem updates

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,560
um probably put in some prometheus

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,560
operator updates

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,880
so yeah so we released to zero forty

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,920
nine

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,119
zero yesterday and now images are

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,480
mirrored to quay and to google container

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,520
google no not google github container

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,080
registry

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,680
we added some support for proxy url in

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,360
probes

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,959
and support for web tls for prometheus

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,200
we're still not on par with features

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,400
from prometheus and alert managers so

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,760
there are still

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,879
pr spending and issues

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,800
issued so if you have time to actually

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:41,200
contribute code or maybe do some reviews

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,200
we are heavily encouraging people to do

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:50,800
that and to help us with

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:55,200
with development

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,840
sounds great yeah um

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,760
and i think that's already kind of it

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,159
for the agenda i don't know if anyone

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,720
has

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,720
anything else to announce right now

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:19,840
otherwise we'll keep it brief and short

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,879
okay i guess that's it for july kind of

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,920
a summer

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,760
summer break vibe going on which is good

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,239
um maybe it's somewhat similar in august

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,440
but

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,599
until then uh have a great summer

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,080

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,080
where you are

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,040
all right take care my way besides you

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,680
are wasted in software you should be a

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,680
radio host

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,120
