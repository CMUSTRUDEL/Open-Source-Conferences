hello everyone I'm your host publicist

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,950
Atticus and this is prometheus and

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,809
microsystem community call we follow

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,730
Prometheus code of conduct here so

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,950
please be nice to one another this is

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,400
being recorded and will be published on

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:23,519
YouTube we also have Mattias who's our

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:25,199
co-host say hello Matas hey yeah and

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,560
today we will be giving away some

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,570
prometheus bag to active participants so

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,989
in order to qualify you just need to ask

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:37,530
a question and we will roll at the end

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:40,559
who Vince from if you swag so today on

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,920
our agenda we have Prometheus

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:50,190
announcements some news from tannaz

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:52,170
cortex graph on AV 7 update and done

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,800
talking about Prometheus community

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:59,370
projects so Prometheus update can start

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,620
oh I am from Aegis update so hello

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,140
everyone my name is Bartek i'm from

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,570
tears and tongues maintainer so it will

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,570
be super quick because this release is

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:15,390
kind of small and the reason is that we

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:19,439
had like two dots 17.2 week ago however

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,189
we just released a fresh one with like

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,030
month

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:25,950
more kind of changes and notably we have

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,680
kind of three things first of all we

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,920
have wall size reduction so we noticed

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,409
that it was kind of too big unnecessary

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,780
it's kind of in a half let's say which

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,240
like improves red light time and like

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,020
the amount of things of different on

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,409
disk I would say but also on top of it

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,090
we have support for yogur so right now

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,790
we can set up a permit use with younger

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,740
and from views we'll send some

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,439
interesting spawns to younger so you can

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,180
actually go back and tell which portion

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,430
of current use is the bottleneck or

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,710
things like that so it is super epic and

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,479
we are looking forward to change that to

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,600
open telemetry at some point so you have

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:10,950
more support for more packets as well

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,530
and then at the end we also moved

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,750
Federation to not query remote and

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,600
points because it was designed not to do

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:22,410
it so that might be a change that you

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,270
not see as well and then we have one

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,980
interesting change coming in I would

00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,900
have many interesting changes but one

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,900
that I looked would like to highlight is

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:34,140
the EM mophead chunks that garnish from

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:38,550
graph analyst was doing and essentially

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:40,440
it it just improves how we store kind of

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,560
the the things in the memory for the

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,160
first two hours of the metrics and it

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,550
just reduced the RAM the memory used for

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:54,810
froma to use significantly I have given

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:57,180
some numbers like 20 from from 20 to 30%

00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,970
of less Ram so which is which is amazing

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,100
and then starting this release or aimed

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,220
for the next release its aim for the

00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,989
next release because I think it's it's

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,220
super soon but this is what I'm what I'm

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:13,860
telling about the future right yeah so

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,400
this is what who can happen in in 2.19

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:22,170
hopefully oh and I mean directly have a

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,790
link for that possible reversed sorry

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,239
what they mean yeah I'm gonna add I'm

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:33,080
gonna add a link to that pull request or

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:39,840
issue in a mock if you look for EM

00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:42,030
chunks six seven nine perfect okay and I

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,070
want to quickly mention to community

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,530
bridge project so community bridge is a

00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:49,410
program for students as you may know and

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,570
I'm talking about that now because today

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,970
or like this week is the only chance to

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,840
get apply for that so just go to

00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:01,470
community bridge website and you can

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,450
apply for both like any kind of CNCs

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,750
project but for prompt use we have two

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,030
nice projects one is the retrospective

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,840
rule evaluation which is like issue

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,910
number 11 so I think is super super you

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,910
know first issue that was created for me

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:20,310
to use and then we have also project for

00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,700
improving remote right so you're welcome

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:27,360
to to help us if your student if you are

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:34,800
agreeable to join so that's for

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:37,229
from DS yeah awesome any questions if

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,599
you have a question just submit it in

00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:41,599
zoom or put it on the dark

00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,849
let's wait like a minute

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,639
you

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,870
awesome I think

00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:21,700
one particle think we are talking now

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:24,910
about Thomas that's correct

00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,670
so for tennis we had kind of

00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,770
announcement last prom to second sister

00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,140
meeting about like latest release so

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,510
let's not talk about that actually the

00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:37,180
next race is next week and it's looking

00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,880
good as well because we I mean we are

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,680
moving very fast forward we have so many

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,430
contributions and kind of thanks for

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,360
that like we are barely kind of even you

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,730
know managed to review all of this but

00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,640
notably we have we are proud to kind of

00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:57,610
improve our ability on the duplication

00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,760
algorithm internals because we have kind

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:03,190
of improved identification algorithm

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,260
that handles the replica from juices

00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:08,890
it's not as easy as you'd you would

00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,540
think of and he was sometimes in each

00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,510
case is not working very well with

00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,240
counters and thanks to Ben and get lab

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:19,030
who gave us like so much data just to

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,130
investigate and reproduce we managed to

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,830
fix it and found it so this is a huge

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,350
step to kept reliable the duplication

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,850
that we can enable offline as well and

00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:31,890
that was kind of blocking the offline

00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:35,050
steps so this is super nice then we have

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:37,540
actually I posted about that kind of

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,670
yesterday we have a new integration for

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,120
store API so essentially you can put a

00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:45,010
simple proxy on top of tano's and enable

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,650
from queues or anything remotely

00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:50,380
compatible to access from ventanas data

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:53,950
so this is between it from from G

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:56,770
research company and then we are also

00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:58,600
also working on the prom QL concurrency

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,270
actually we're literally discussing this

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,120
this morning so Kemah one of tano's

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:06,010
maintainer is working on that and while

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,320
we don't want to kind of enable this on

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,240
permit use yet because there is no

00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,440
reason to make it concurrent for a

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,840
single process but we are having a huge

00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,330
kind of benefit in from jessica system

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:23,310
like cortex and tano's where we can

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:26,529
actually tell prom ql2 for every fetch

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,179
from data

00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,069
in the back ends so it could be objects

00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:32,079
or it could be whatever to do it

00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:35,049
concurrently so think about one query

00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,119
that habit has some sub queries or maybe

00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:39,969
you know operations on different metrics

00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:42,369
like division like whatever you need to

00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:44,409
it was doing a sequential fetch now it

00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:47,559
will do concurrent so this will improve

00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:50,079
latency are very very enormous Li so we

00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:53,169
are super happy about that and then one

00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,599
last but not the least Peter and Marco

00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:57,849
from cortex are like keeping

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,999
contributing so much to Donna's and I

00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:04,179
think will submerge the support for cash

00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:07,599
for four chunks so like chance is the

00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:10,659
very well this is where your samples are

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,009
start so now you can catch those you

00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:14,469
will have you will be able to catch

00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:16,809
those on memcache D and that you know

00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:20,079
and they're all mostly improve you know

00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:21,909
the latency as well and amount of amount

00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,129
of operations again object storage so

00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:26,859
that's pretty amazing I'm super happy

00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:29,409
with that so that's the most notable

00:08:26,859 --> 00:08:31,449
things and quick update for community

00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:34,329
bridge Dennis is also participating and

00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:38,139
we have I think two projects right now

00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:40,240
one is Docs versioning so this is

00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:42,399
actually what chrome use is looking

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,759
forward as well so you know the ability

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:49,990
for huger that templating like you know

00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:54,149
the website engine to to be able to kind

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:58,889
of see the versions of different

00:08:54,149 --> 00:09:01,809
document document the version of the

00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:04,089
dogs for each version separately for

00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:06,699
each release right while this is not has

00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:09,069
nothing to do with kind of metrics every

00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:11,709
project needs that so we would like to

00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:15,929
kind of Mentor that and second project

00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:19,660
is request logging and and tracking and

00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:22,689
limiting so this is also antic work that

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:26,170
is needed on tunnels and yeah I'm

00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:28,209
actually connected to to work garnish is

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,249
doing as well with Cole box and and

00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:32,529
serious life cycles so we are definitely

00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:36,519
moving in direction of having better

00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:38,709
limiting storage as well so oh yeah and

00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,360
let's quickly mention one more summer of

00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:42,070
dogs which is

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:47,080
this is like he had another program but

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:48,760
for documents kind of and yeah we are

00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,030
kind of planning to propose the catechol

00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:55,810
de tutorial kind of finish of finished

00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:59,400
completion of that for Thomas as well so

00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:03,850
please join us that's it Thanks

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,190
awesome awesome any questions we'll wait

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:13,420
about one minute please put Sam on zoom

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:15,430
or yeah or on the Google Doc there is

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:20,290
one question that is asked in the Q&A

00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:22,780
section okay any plan study this binary

00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,210
sizes of tano's couldn't get 60

00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,980
megabytes not sure if they're a concern

00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:31,120
in the industry but it's something that

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:34,780
maintenance are thinking about 16 or 60

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,960
bytes 60 megabytes yeah this is like

00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:40,720
interesting topic like we are not aware

00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,460
of the need of this so if you are in

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,320
very neat and you have like use case

00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,080
that you really want to I don't have

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,630
production infrastructure or like you

00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,300
are it's very painful for you just put a

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,830
ticket on that and just let us know that

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,880
is the problem because we were not

00:10:53,830 --> 00:11:00,220
optimizing for that right so so there

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,340
are certain steps that you can you can

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,260
you can do you can build by binary goal

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,240
and binary in a certain way that Street

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,280
that strips down the debugging and like

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:13,660
you can definitely have helpful this

00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,290
size or even even more and so or even

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,940
less sorry

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:24,100
so yeah just let us know and that's

00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:28,470
that's all awesome I guess we can move

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:30,640
on to cortex updates

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:36,550
Brian do you want to do the G sock

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,910
update sure hi I'm Brian Boram I got the

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,370
news

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:42,300
couple of days ago we we got a slot on

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:45,880
google Summer of Code

00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:49,720
so Jai Batra who I don't think is on the

00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:53,930
call is gonna be the student and the

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:56,300
project is selective indexing so

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,940
the moment cortex indexes every label

00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:04,700
that it gets she's really fast and

00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:09,260
really expensive and so there's a theory

00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:11,089
at least that if you just in Dec or at

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,399
least a few if you eliminate fields that

00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:19,760
you're never going to query on like le

00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:23,920
and then okay why you mostly never query

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,130
on anyway that's the idea and that's the

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,380
update

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:33,620
so welcome J Batra yep

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,750
he also submitted a pull request to add

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,670
version documents to cortex so that is

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,520
also super cool we will also have

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:45,440
version Doc's like Prometheus and soon

00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:48,350
like Thanos and so we are going to cut

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,029
cortex 1.1 next week we are also

00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,959
following a six-week cadence like

00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:56,720
Prometheus and lots of good things are

00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:58,790
coming hopefully will merge TLS support

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,279
like end-to-end TLS between components

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:06,410
we are using the same node exporter

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:08,240
library we wanted to do some remote

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,890
write mirroring to two different

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,570
clusters so that we could set up a test

00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:16,190
cluster based on the block storage it in

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,900
in parallel to one of our production

00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,880
cast clusters so that we can test the

00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,830
block search performance so for that we

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,480
wanted to do remote write mirroring and

00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:26,000
we wanted to write a component for that

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,920
but turns out NY has a mirroring

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,770
directive which works really really well

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,870
for us so we did not need to change any

00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:34,670
of the data that we were mirroring so

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,140
this works really well but hopefully in

00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:43,250
the future we can collaborate on a

00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:48,740
mirroring tool that also changes gates

00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:50,209
data and as part of 1.1 we've been

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,490
running the right ahead log inside

00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:52,910
cortex in production for about two weeks

00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,260
now

00:13:52,910 --> 00:14:00,620
and we're hopefully going to call it not

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:03,339
experimental give all the guarantees for

00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,329
that yep

00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:09,529
so that's it

00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:12,589
from the context of dates awesome if you

00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:15,850
have any questions about cortex or

00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:18,470
Karthik's update please ask them now I

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,110
can see that we have one question what

00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:23,239
is maintained by this community I guess

00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,980
we're gonna it is something for later

00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:26,809
yeah yeah something for later because

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:30,439
we're gonna talk about it later

00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:34,360
thank you for the question cool so any

00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:34,360
questions about cortex

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,899
let's wait like 30 more seconds

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,280
you

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:11,860
cool I think we can continue now we have

00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:14,890
graph ama oh hello hello everyone I am

00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:18,700
are witnessing from Griffin elapse I

00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:21,370
will be presenting some new features

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:26,050
from our upcoming version 7 beliefs

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:29,830
which is out in beta first of all I will

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:32,860
be discussing our new revised plugin

00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:37,120
architecture which is basically a

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:39,430
unified system for developing plugins

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,470
with both front end and the back end

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:49,570
components this is something I've been

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:53,910
working on myself and the back end

00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:58,260
component of plugins is actually

00:15:53,910 --> 00:16:01,750
launched para fauna as separate classes

00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,920
communicating with the hosts - ah via

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,730
the a

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:14,100
Hasek or plugin protocol which is on top

00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:18,070
of G RPC and we use Apache ro as

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:22,810
transportation formats for passing data

00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:27,700
frames between plugins and the angra

00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:31,420
fauna and one of the plugins i've helped

00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:36,750
develop using this new architecture is

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:40,270
the Google sheets resource which allows

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:46,450
visualizing google spreadsheets in ingre

00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:51,850
fauna furthermore we've developed a new

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:56,910
go plug-in sdk for for writing plugins

00:16:51,850 --> 00:17:01,020
and which is again wrapping the hoja for

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:06,459
plug-in protocol for communicating over

00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:10,240
G RPC and I'm going to switch to screen

00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:14,760
sharing because I just want to to

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,760
demonstrate this functionality

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:28,490
so what I'm showing here is basically a

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:33,590
gauge panel displaying one row from

00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:33,590
Google Spreadsheets and

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:44,640
a new feature that has been introduced

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:48,860
in version 7 is this so-called inspected

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:53,070
drawer where you can see the tab blur

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:58,620
representation for example over the

00:17:53,070 --> 00:18:03,120
query results so this so here you can

00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:08,930
see the the the tabular representation

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:14,540
of the older sheet and you can see

00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:16,800
statistics metadata and you can also see

00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:19,830
Jason representations of the panel

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:23,640
itself and the the panel which can be

00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:31,500
quite helpful in in debugging your

00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:39,810
Reforma visualizations and another cool

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:43,050
feature is a query history where Reforma

00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:47,480
can keep history of a certain time span

00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:50,370
by default won't be a history of your

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,250
queries within that time span so here

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:57,660
you can see today I've performed 17

00:18:53,250 --> 00:19:00,930
queries and it's possible it's possible

00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:06,270
to favorite your queries and you can

00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:14,630
also add a you can add comments to your

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:14,630
parents which which should be be helpful

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:25,320
and this also brings me to the last

00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:28,500
feature I want to show which is the the

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,610
tracing viewer in the in the explore

00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:38,370
page where you can see the traces from

00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:44,100
from yay again or Zeke in backends the

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:45,910
data sources so here you can here we can

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:53,860
see

00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:59,860
tracing span from from Jaeger with its

00:19:53,860 --> 00:20:08,559
it's tags and and the process process

00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:15,880
may metadata so that that is all I have

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:20,020
to present for now awesome thank you and

00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:22,320
this is a document how to oh now this is

00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,320
hell

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:32,200
thank you so much yeah so if anybody has

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:35,130
any questions for Gravano folks it would

00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,130
be amazing

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:44,820
cool let's wait for like 30 more seconds

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,310
you

00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:58,840
all right I guess I'll start into the

00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:02,110
previous community we've been slowly

00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,870
onboarding new projects under the

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:07,660
Prometheus community repo this is a a

00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,700
semi-official place where exporters can

00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:13,920
be maintained by the wider Bri theist

00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:16,380
developer community and user community

00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:20,530
in the last couple of weeks we've added

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,660
several new exporters and to prompt ql

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:27,330
language related components so that you

00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:31,470
can use prom QL as part of your editor

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:33,130
and then of course the the exporters are

00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,080
exporters that are important to the

00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,570
community but we're not getting them

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,640
some of the maintenance from their

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:41,860
original authors because the original

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,660
authors aren't mean weren't able to

00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,220
maintain them and now they have a new

00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,020
home and hopefully we can get more

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:54,220
people to participate in updating those

00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:56,530
exporters yeah so do we have some kind

00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,270
of altar right and export alike I didn't

00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:00,640
go long so that we were can follow well

00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:03,370
best practices when we get a new

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:07,500
exposure we kind of copy what we do

00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:07,500
somewhere else and try to do the same oh

00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,690
we have the writing exporters guide and

00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:18,180
the official previous talks some of the

00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:21,520
patterns are are not exactly documented

00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:24,670
as part of bringing in these various

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,130
exporters the what I've been doing is

00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:30,970
updating them to use some of the

00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:34,530
standard exporter patterns like circle

00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:39,250
CI builds and prom you and all the other

00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:41,980
mostly build related components the

00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:44,770
other thing is that the exporter is an

00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,720
integrations list on the pts io like the

00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,480
bar for adding that is roughly speaking

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,070
sending a pure but as part of that your

00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,460
exporter will be reviewed and you will

00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,960
get commentary and basically you don't

00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,370
have to implement any English unless I

00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,310
say please stop putting passwords in the

00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,960
command line but everything else there

00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,910
is a suggestion but at least you know

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,490
that anything is that is on that list

00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,650
has at least been looked at and some

00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,030
feedback being

00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,700
and not necessarily implemented because

00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:14,680
well as Ben says the community should

00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,240
help these teams long term and just

00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,070
pointed people to one team will

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,570
hopefully encourage the community to

00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,910
come together and improve things over

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,380
time because obviously not everything is

00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:26,910
going to be produced perfectly out of

00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,910
whole cloth first time around

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,440
good thank you

00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:35,299
awesome we have so we had the question

00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:37,100
for prometheus community what is

00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:37,909
maintained by Prometheus community

00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,259
prometheus

00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:42,379
I know it's still what we wanna do a

00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:48,200
prank on update ok sorry please continue

00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:50,509
done who put on the prom cone apply into

00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,610
the West I'm not sure if we want to do

00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:59,059
pro con update but I think we have to do

00:23:52,610 --> 00:24:01,549
a prom cut update yeah it's a physical

00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:07,340
thing it's a goner I think that's kind

00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:10,179
of obvious to everyone which is current

00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:17,809
thinking is also very much going against

00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:22,730
even trying to have a as it currently

00:24:17,809 --> 00:24:25,549
looks we we don't really expect social

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:27,080
distancing to be fully revoked and you

00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:29,240
basically would meet that for any

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:33,379
anything of any size and especially as

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:37,119
we wanted to to grow beyond the 220 in

00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:40,490
Europe as well that makes it even harder

00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:44,230
yeah long story short this year there

00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:48,950
won't be a physical which is nice that

00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:52,389
being said we will have a virtual one we

00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:55,549
are currently tempted to I either do

00:24:52,389 --> 00:25:00,230
either do like a month and then have one

00:24:55,549 --> 00:25:02,600
or two talks every every every week or

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,389
maybe have a week and then just have two

00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:08,240
or three times per week obviously time

00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:10,309
zone and blah blah blah I have a strong

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,710
preference and I would like to hear what

00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:14,710
what every one of you is thinking I

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:21,320
would vote for distributing kind of in

00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:24,019
time so we are not overwhelmed and

00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:31,490
everyone can join and also have time for

00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:34,600
family and work agree with that would be

00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,600
kind of a nice trade-off

00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:41,619
I would prefer limiting it to a week

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,619
rather than the whole month

00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:48,320
yeah putting it out over a week yeah a

00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:50,510
week Mont is a long time a week at least

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,990
you know in spread across time zones but

00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:56,060
amongst just dragging on a bit much so

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,990
my own personal preference is also to

00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:02,780
make it more like a week to to keep

00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:05,360
overhead and also time commitment like I

00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:09,110
agree that kind of sucks with like this

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,000
is a we've very you might not have too

00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:15,410
much time but to be honest it would be

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,480
the same if we if you include treasure

00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:20,480
and such and if you if you need to go

00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:24,770
over the pond you basically are not are

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:29,060
not available for family for a week

00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:30,920
anyway so it's it's even less impersonal

00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,650
thing and it's it's way easier to

00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:37,070
organize and to keep keep some people

00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:40,720
interested but that's not me deciding

00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,720
hey we have to do it like this

00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:52,160
I think week is still better than just

00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,100
one day fact of everything and sitting

00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:59,750
well it would be one day it would be

00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:02,270
week maybe have one top rate for per day

00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:10,040
or maybe two every two days or whatever

00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:11,480
like that'sthat's yeah like I think it

00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,030
would make sense to kind of like make it

00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,920
dependent on how many talks we want to

00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:18,890
have kind of as we're right and then

00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:23,840
from there take it from there yeah no

00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:25,910
problem many are proposed sorry we have

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,400
a normal pronghorn is about 20 talks

00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:30,880
plus ten thousand hundred fifteen twenty

00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,880
writing talks

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:48,470
what about tweeter ball yeah I can do

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:51,170
that you didn't consider it yet but and

00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:53,030
another question is like that's because

00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:57,320
there are people that propose already

00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:59,740
right are we going to do yet another

00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:05,180
totally different resset of their

00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:07,310
proposals or no no no that's part that

00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:10,340
was part of the contingency planning

00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:13,610
from basically almost day one and that

00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:17,030
if we are not able to do a remote in

00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:18,560
person things that we would that we

00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:23,480
would reuse the same content obviously

00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:26,000
we obviously and also everyone is still

00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,500
more than then invited to to submit

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,110
stuff of course we're still looking for

00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,480
content like it actually makes a few

00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,100
things easier to have this like you

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,810
don't have travel restrictions you don't

00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:40,250
need to think hey maybe I want it visa

00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:42,110
maybe I don't have funding blah blah

00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:52,340
blah blah all those concerns go away

00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:56,080
which is also kind of nice yeah awesome

00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:59,750
I think we can move on to questions if

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,510
anybody if we don't mind so basically we

00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:04,550
had a question from Shay what is

00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:06,530
maintained by prometheus community forum

00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:09,170
if you suffered it at home chart or back

00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:13,060
you Prometheus just wondering which is

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,060
which of them is more up to date

00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:25,220
probably go ahead so actually I mean it

00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:29,150
depends on what you what is what is

00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:31,970
meant by Prometheus community so neither

00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:36,830
of those charts are maintained by the

00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:38,960
maintainer of Prometheus or Prometheus

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:43,220
operator all those are separately

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,470
maintained by folks in the community we

00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,100
used to have a chart even though we

00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,740
didn't

00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,750
maintain it ourselves either and we

00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:53,810
actually moved it out of the previous

00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:58,760
operator Rico because nobody was

00:29:53,810 --> 00:30:02,960
maintaining it and so the there was kind

00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:05,450
of a problem or mismatch of people like

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,900
to consume the ham charts but nobody

00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:12,590
wants to maintain them and there was

00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:17,210
recently an issue on our on our repo

00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:20,540
asking if there could be a move back I

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:23,030
don't think it until there is someone

00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:25,220
who's actually committed to to

00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:27,290
maintaining it I don't think we're going

00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:29,300
to do that that said we're very happy to

00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:32,690
give someone who wants to give that a

00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:35,660
shot a blessed space essentially like we

00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:38,780
can create a repo pacifically for for

00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:43,640
the sound chart but the maintainers

00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:45,500
don't use helm themselves so like we we

00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:50,330
can't really maintain it in a way that

00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:53,440
is satisfactory to people and I think

00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:59,750
this is this touches a wider point that

00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:03,020
the premises community as a whole like

00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:05,660
do stuff with it it's not just to be

00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:08,510
there to be consumed it's actually meant

00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,250
as a place for people to experiment and

00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:17,720
do something is Frederic site in a

00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:19,780
breast way awesome if you need it maybe

00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,070
see what find someone will help you but

00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:24,140
it's a problem with them if they want to

00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:31,100
consume it or not it's kind of the point

00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:32,870
of film awesome awesome I think we can

00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:37,430
move on to the next question then you

00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:40,340
had the question yeah so the we've been

00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:42,770
we've we added compression for the right

00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,140
ahead log a number of releases ago I

00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:47,450
don't think a lot of people have run in

00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:50,030
any issues with it or bugs there hasn't

00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:52,160
been a lot of reports and we've been

00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,670
running it in production for a number of

00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,220
months now

00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:58,490
and it looks pretty good what do people

00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,660
think about turning it on by default so

00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,090
I think

00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,860
that as we just made some changes with

00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:07,610
the wall like reducing the size by two

00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:10,130
and that we will start missing a one

00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,290
with will he play with chunks in memory

00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:14,690
that kind of things that it might be

00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:17,120
safer to stay white another release to

00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:20,330
change that so that if we get people

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,090
having problems hitting the wall we

00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:26,390
kinda know where it is and not to big

00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:28,130
changes like that at once yeah I was

00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:30,500
gonna say the same as Julian like

00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:33,230
enabling wall compression is pretty low

00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,780
risk however it am up stuff coming in is

00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:38,510
high risk and having those both in the

00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:40,220
same release is unwise but we probably

00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:42,680
could have done it in two eighteen

00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:46,460
parity safely and people got in a 4x

00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,990
reduction in well size but I guess I'd

00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,690
reduce from the next release if a map

00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,680
doesn't land or do one after assuming M

00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,420
map doesn't turn out to be too

00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,420
problematic and if not one after again

00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:05,160
awesome awesome I think we can move on

00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:09,140
to the next question

00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:12,480
so Matthias you had a question yeah so

00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:15,150
while I really appreciate the other like

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,620
nice features and you I improved more

00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:19,650
like actually user experience

00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:22,020
improvements for graph on a 7 we do run

00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:24,420
a bunch of like kind of more immutable

00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:27,170
graph ana instances so we don't really

00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:29,850
want things where like people can like

00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:32,610
essentially put state on on graph ana

00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:35,299
right so like the query history is

00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:38,160
somewhat state but like especially like

00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:41,330
favorite inquiries and such like that's

00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,620
something at least for like an immutable

00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:45,929
deployment of graph Anna I would like to

00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,820
see at least like the Ava to disabled so

00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:49,710
that like people don't start favorite

00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:52,590
enquiries and then all of a sudden like

00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:56,309
the pot gets restarted and like they're

00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:58,230
confused why it's gone so I guess that's

00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:00,720
like - you are will over someone else

00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:03,679
yeah I'm like say I'm taking all of it

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,679
thanks

00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:13,100
so one thing to add the query history as

00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,010
far as I know is in the local browser

00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:18,290
state and its local to you so even if

00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,909
you restart kevanna as long as the

00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,860
cookies are same as long as the local

00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:25,100
browser state is not cleared you still

00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:27,740
have the query history be like I don't

00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,110
think we've added like graph on a level

00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:32,030
query history just yet that will be the

00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:34,280
next step and probably if you're having

00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:40,700
no back-end database you won't be able

00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:43,370
to do that so we had exactly this

00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,080
discussion and I wasn't certain

00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:47,390
if that was to be solved of the

00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,429
discussion but I know that that I made

00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:56,750
basically the same argument that that I

00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:59,000
didn't want to have we will check yeah I

00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:02,000
mean like I totally get that like people

00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,930
run database and that makes sense for

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,630
their deployments but they're also like

00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:11,690
how about we just put the answer in the

00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:14,270
in the meeting notes afterwards then

00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:16,010
everyone on this that's that's the

00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,270
easiest way to ensure that everyone here

00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:21,400
in this question will also have an

00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:21,400
answer that's good

00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,670
awesome

00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,120
and we also had a couple of questions

00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:35,420
about graph on which has been answered

00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:38,990
by a brain chat so I think this is it

00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:42,980
we are like out of time so Matas do you

00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:46,130
wanna roll the dice and tau Henare yeah

00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:49,490
so like as far as I could see we had

00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:52,100
three people outside of Prometheus

00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:53,750
focused themself asking questions when I

00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:57,320
like roll the dice between one and three

00:35:53,750 --> 00:36:06,140
and three is like I use the Google

00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:15,590
random generator number so Madonn you

00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:19,210
won the price you want to swear yeah if

00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:21,110
