	00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,600
so yeah recording so yeah that was

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,719
fun or maybe not but i guess um

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,400
that is a good reminder not to

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,440
not to tweet meeting urls we had similar

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,600
issues early

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,960
in last year so i guess it's school

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,119
holiday summer

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,480
i still remember all this fun from my

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,640
freenote days you could

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,160
always tell when you had school holidays

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,000
somewhere of course

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,599
people started doing exactly this kind

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,119
of thing anyway

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,119
let's do actual work

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,840
and sorry for everyone now only watching

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,000
the recording we had some

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,239
interesting code of conduct violations

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,520
just a second ago

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,640
um but let's do work so um

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,920
first point of order we were asked to

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,199
adapt our our governance

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,039
um while there is currently nothing in

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,640
the actual

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,760
requirements still there was an

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,080
ask to have to not have a self-appointed

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,680
benevolent dictator for life

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,520
that government's change has been made

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,880
that is in pull request

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,479
number two and i would ask you to

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,280
um to confirm it i see brian already did

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,080
confirm it

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,799
um yeah and just suggested adding a

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,560
comma

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,840
yeah i saw yesterday yeah no uh uh

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,880
yeah i could still make sense either way

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,960
i think it's just a little cleaner that

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,479
way

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,040
yeah okay no worries we'll do after um

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,119
the one thing to point out which is

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,000
important in the change and that has

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,600
already been

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,520
uh like i already talked about this with

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,520
with toc and with um

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,520
sick governance if my memory serves me

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,880
right

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,960
i'm really bad with names as you know um

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,079
there is now a provision of alignment

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,040
with

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,079
prometheus cortex and thanos which is

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,319
standing before everything else in

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,000
the governance and also to change

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,039
alignment away from the prometheus

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,680
project

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,319
we would need unaluminus agreement from

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,480
all open observability team members

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,239
um which is the initial reason to to

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,760
have the self-appointed benevolent

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,280
dictator for life thing and now we're

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,360
just replacing that

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,599
protective function with with a

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,640
statement of alignment

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,000
so i get we already have consensus on

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,840
this one but again

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,840
please note that in the in the actual pr

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
justin

00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,480
sorry so the next one um itf update

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,920
i got quite some feedback out of band

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,519
but not on the mailing list

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,840
uh for whatever reason um

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,599
well people were concerned and basically

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,159
had impostor syndrome

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,680
there as far as i'm aware itf lists

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,280
actually encourage people to

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,599
to post anyway

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,319
i will or we should be putting in more

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,959
rational

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,360
uh in prose about what this actually

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,519
means

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,280
where it's coming from how much adoption

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,120
it has i know we already have verbiage

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,720
in the in the intro section

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,599
but we should be putting in more um also

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,440
um i was asked to put other numbers like

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,159
for example that

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,799
the client goaling is the 29th most used

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,280
library

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,720
in go on earth blah blah blah blah like

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,959
all those uh

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,000
adoption numbers to just uh strengthen

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,959
the case which

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,680
uh that this is basically documenting

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,959
existing

00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,000
and and widely adopted uh concept

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:04,319
and not trying to to to do something

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,080
from scratch um also i registered for

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,519
itf 110

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,640
and in the scope of awg

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,760
or a you know apps awg

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,040
um i'll be talking about about

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:23,199
this effort and about standardization

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,840
to just reply to any

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,840
any questions

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
um

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,680
and we have a few updates um i do think

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,880
we need to

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,080
need to expand the faq

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,000
quite a bit just to to carry over

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,520
the most common questions um i can also

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,520
link to the

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,800
dlc explainer which i did i think a

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,199
month ago

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,000
also about like differences and

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,560
alignment with

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,639
open telemetry openmetrics blah blah

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,360
blah blah

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,960
maybe a little bit where is this faq

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,160
should we refer to

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,520
it should in the end live in the

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,840
open metrics repository we do a little

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,639
bit

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,280
of verbiage already or medium bit of

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,600
verb

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,320
which um but we should put even more

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,320
questions

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,360
we keep getting the same question which

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,360
makes sense to

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,160
uh to expand this um

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,400
i am also tempted to just put in a

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,880
timeline of sorts and everything just

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,680
to enable people to uh to onboard

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,000
themselves

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,000
more quickly because uh historically we

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,520
didn't do a super great job of this

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,840
and while obviously we can argue that

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,720
it's basically just prometheus reference

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,039
code anyway

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,160
um it just makes sense to have that in

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,440
one single place

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,000
so i would i would try and get a lot

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,440
more

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,520
control in there um on the same uh

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,880
at the same time also looking at the at

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,880
the internet draft and

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,400
like exceeding the two from each other

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,000
yeah i think a separate faq makes sense

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,319
i'd be wary of just

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,759
going full faq inside the infinite draft

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,800
because that's not what that's for

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,840
no no that's outside of the actual

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,560
specification

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,319
uh for inside the specification uh it's

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560
about strengthening uh

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,520
the case for yes this is an actually

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,560
widely adopted organic standard

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,360
for outside the specification it is

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,840
about

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,560
basically walking through all the things

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,919
also

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,280
linking to the other resources we have

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,520
explainers of context i know that quite

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,720
a bit is in the consideration section of

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,039
the actual specification

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,240
but experience has shown that people

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,199
don't read that section

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,680
so um it just makes sense to to distill

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,880
it down

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:59,199
into an faq style thing

00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:03,360
to just make it more easily accessible

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,759
yeah and

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,400
that is more than it already we're at

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,759
aob

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,479
um i had one item just from reviewing

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,319
the

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,000
circular exemplary storage one in

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,000
prometheus uh

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,360
callum asked the question that hey it's

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,280
not pointed out

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,880
that time stamps of exemplars should

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,039
increase over time across expositions

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,639
which you know we can probably just make

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,000
that as an explicit line

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,599
but that's like the only thing i've

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,800
noted that hey that might be a little

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,840
bit clearer inside the docs like

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,840
everything else is pretty clear

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,960
that is yeah

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,800
okay i i don't have that section in my

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,160
head but yes if if that's the case then

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,520
absolutely we should we should

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,120
strengthen that one

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,560
makes sense makes sense

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,800
because i recovered timestamps generally

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,680
but not for example but i i

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,800
like it it was obviously so obvious to

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,240
me i didn't even think of mentioning it

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,080
unlike everything else which is

00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,520
so obvious to me what i mentioned anyway

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,319
obvious is is is is a dangerous word of

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,080
course what's

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,000
obvious to one person might not be

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,800
always to another person

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,440
um and yeah so yeah but we'll just put

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,520
it in

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:19,280
it's a good point it's a good point

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,280
um for anything else

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,479
i mean this is a super short one because

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,879
we did basically release

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,560
we can maybe for people watching this

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,280
those two bits and pieces might be

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,919
interesting so

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,880
this is basically me repurposing this

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,479
call

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,479
for general information um so a

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,320
uh within the context of prometheus

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,519
buren uh presented his

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,480
uh high resolution histogram proposal um

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,240
we can also link

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,880
this from the notes so people can find

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,480
it after and that is way way way too

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,120
early to actually

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,279
really do anything about within

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,399
openmetrics proper

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,360
yet it's currently being proposed and

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,600
discussed

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,560
the other piece of information which is

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
relevant for

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,680
people watching this on youtube is

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,760
that there is now a prometheus working

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,560
group with an open telemetry

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,240
where we are actively working on on

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,000
basically aligning

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,480
open telemetry so it is

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,920
open matrix and permit this compatible

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,920
and just walking through

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,760
through all the issues and and trying to

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,160
help where we can

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:35,200
by either uh yeah adapting explaining uh

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,279
whatever um to just see that those

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,720
efforts um

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,040
are compatible yeah

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,120
and like reading true bjorn's proposal

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,200
it's reasonably high level

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,240
right it's not much adding much more as

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,320
someone who's been following his

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,000
presentations and whatnot over the years

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,160
it's just writing them all down largely

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,839
there's some new stuff in there

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,680
and you know that's obviously still a

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,720
while away and the one thing that just

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,560
kind of stood out to me from

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,079
an open metric standpoint is how does

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,839
this work with the text format

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,760
because i think in terms of long-term

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,120
adoption you know openmetrics is always

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,880
going to have text that worked out

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,480
really well for regis just making sure

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,920
there's an answer there i think it's

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:20,560
too early to to really have text

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:23,279
format um to really have text format

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,279
answers here

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,800
the intention of burn is to to do this

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,640
in proto more than in text which for the

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,560
exploratory phase seems

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,560
seems to make sense um but this is way

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,600
way way way way before the point where

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,399
it actually matters

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,920
in in the official standardization of

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,560
the wire format

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,079
so currently it's the intention is to

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,519
not even have this in a feature flag or

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,880
anything but literally just carry

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,120
branches

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,480
per sub project and just implement it

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,000
there test it there

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,279
see how it works and once

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,200
it's reasonably stable and battle proven

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,279
then and only then actually look at

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,000
officially formalizing standardizing

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,720
blah blah blah

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,160
blah so i wouldn't expect this to happen

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,920
anytime soon

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,519
yeah i i just had the general concern we

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,240
accidentally end up with two de facto

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,720
standards

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,320
or well two standards whoever you count

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,920
no so from the prometheus side the

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,200
intention is and remains

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,160
that uh that open metric is uh

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,680
is the format which prometheus supports

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,040
as the one single thing

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,360
once things become stable um while it's

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,200
in

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,920
in experimental phase everything goes um

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,680
it's like again it's not even the future

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,519
flag it's literally a branch at the

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,320
moment or the intention is to have the

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,360
branches

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,519
somewhere there already so yeah

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,880
it feels as if this one is super short

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,160
but on the other hand we

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,600
i mean we had a little incident uh we

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,839
don't have guests due to the little

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,760
incident

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,800
and we're more or less in

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,959
maintenance and and

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,639
incremental improved mode at the moment

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,760
anyway

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,839
so one thing which i need to do is

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,440
actually figure out what's happening on

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,320
the prometheus calendar because there

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,360
are at least

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,360
two different calendars

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,000
and i publish both the prometheus dev

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,120
summit and the open methods

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,240
dev summit in the prometheus community

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,440
calendar which i

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,079
thought was directly but apparently not

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,200
but i don't

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,720
see the real uh calendar in my premises

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,720
io account so i don't

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,240
know what's happening there and that

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,399
needs to be fixed

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,760
and also i need to be figuring out how

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,760
to protect against

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:46,720
um those future occurrences of course

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,760
what i just saw in in google meet as

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,320
protections was

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,360
abysmal in in comparison towards zoo

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,480
meds

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,000
i know that google for education has all

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,639
the bells and whistles which we would

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,200
need but

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:06,240
apparently um that's not the case for

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:08,399
for uh which are in depth

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,639
not good let's let's phrase it as not

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,639
good

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,680
and with that we're at time anyway or

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,680
two minutes before at time

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,200
so yeah to anyone watching this morning

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,600
this didn't work out as

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,120
as nicely as we had planned and for the

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,120
next one it'll be better

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:35,839
um and please

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,839
join the next one and try and be part

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:45,680
cool see you everyone

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,680
