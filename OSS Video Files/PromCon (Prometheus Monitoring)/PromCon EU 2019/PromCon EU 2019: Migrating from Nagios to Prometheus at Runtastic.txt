	Speaker: Niko Dominkowitsch

Thinking of replacing your existing monitoring solution with Prometheus? In this talk we will show you how Runtastic moved its monitoring and alerting stack from Nagios to Prometheus. We'll show you how we managed to do this, how monitoring and alerting works with Prometheus and what challenges we were facing.

We will cover these topics:

    How our journey started
    Using Consul for Service Discovery
    Using Terraform for managing health checks and silences for new micro services
    Building a pipeline to test and deploy alerting and recording rules automatically
    Using OpsGenie for Alert management
    Examples of common checks in Nagios and how we implemented them with Prometheus
    Examples of custom written Exporters
    Lessons Learned
