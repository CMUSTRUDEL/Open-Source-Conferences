Title: PromCon EU 2019: Remote Write Storage Wars
Publication date: 2019-12-29
Playlist: PromCon EU 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Alejandro Cespedes

Remote write storage is a hot topic, several systems existed for a few years (Cortex, M3DB, InfluxDB) and some systems have been born in the past few months (Thanos receive, VictoriaMetrics). Each system has it's own architecture and different trade-offs. In this talk, Alejandro will present adidas findings on experiments to benchmark various remote write open source storage systems such as Cortex, M3DB, Thanos, VictoriaMetrics and others. The experiments try to benchmark scalability and elasticity of each storage system.
