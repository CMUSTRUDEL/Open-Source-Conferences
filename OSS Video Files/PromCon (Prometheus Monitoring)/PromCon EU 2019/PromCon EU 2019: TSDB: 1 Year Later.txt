Description: 
	Speaker: Ganesh Vernekar

Since a major revamp of the Prometheus storage engine as part of the Prometheus 2.0 release, there have been a lot of enhancements and feature additions in TSDB.

In this talk I will speak about all that has gone into TSDB since 2.0 was released, some of the notable ones include:

    Backfilling
    Disk size based retention
    WAL compression and read optimizations
    Postings compression and lifting the 64 GiB index size limit to be practically unlimited
    Allocation and memory optimization for compaction
    Various optimization for the queries
    Read Only mode
    Isolation

I will also talk about how each of these developments impacted Prometheus and how devs embedding them in their own apps can leverage them.
