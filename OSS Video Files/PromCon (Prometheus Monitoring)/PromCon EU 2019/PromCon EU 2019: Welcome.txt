00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,140
tomorrow tomorrow's closing keynote this

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,600

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,640
not okay

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,910
don't burn yourself out and if you see

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,500
anyone who's burning out talk to them CN

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,660
CF is also starting stuff in this

00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,560
direction that's really good I really

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,170
appreciate it

00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,180
I didn't use it but like people should

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,720
be using it and people should be having

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,460
those conversations and that privilege

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,369
should be here for me for you for

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,340
everyone I mean especially given like we

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,590
have 220 seats and people would have we

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,280
would have sold 500 so yeah it's a

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,530
privilege to be here software is

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:27,600
changing the world software is eating

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,550
the world and you're part of that the

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,479
climate catastrophe is also eating the

00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:36,180
world and you're also part of that so

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,080
let's do a test everyone who has

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:43,650
children raise your hands everyone whom

00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,170
I don't keep them up keep among everyone

00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:52,380
who thinks they might have children at

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:58,200
some point raise your hands or who has

00:01:52,380 --> 00:02:00,180
nieces or nephews or whatever like keep

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,659
it open keep it up we'll keep it open up

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,459
so lower your hands I know keep them

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,659
open if you flew here else lower them

00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:14,220
okay you get my point

00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:18,239
thank you we're coming to that in a

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,069
second we don't have new Baxters here we

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,300
are using up the sash which I kept at

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:23,830
home for last year and the year before

00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,440
they're positioned over there and over

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,230
there we will not be printing new bags

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,090
unless in this show of hands

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:38,970
people actually want bags so who wants

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:41,770
bags cool we need some data at least

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,680
same for printed schedules raise your

00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,300
hand if you want printed schedules

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:52,870
he makes them he likes them so we have

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:54,520
one printed schedule next year cool but

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,050
in all seriousness we have the bags I

00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,670
will not be throwing them away I'll just

00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,410
be putting them out again and again and

00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,120
again until they are gone so if you

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,580
wanna back take them again they're here

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,540
and at the t-shirt booth or table

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,190
whatever and just grab them if you want

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,630
them but only grab them if you want them

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:15,870
for t-shirts we can also do show of

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:20,710
hands who wants t-shirts for prom cone

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:23,080
yes so if you plan to use what you

00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,850
showed great if you do not plan to use

00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,780
your t-shirt just put it back on the

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,850
table

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,440
and someone who has actually planning to

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:34,090
use it or to bring it to someone else or

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:39,130
whatever can take it just a little bit

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:41,530
conscious about that stuff so about

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:47,380
sustainability and such some of you saw

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:50,140
this this is the attendee swag on

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,300
purpose I mean for for for carry-on only

00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,040
it's a little bit icky for forty ones

00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:58,930
who want we can tape some water bottles

00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:02,530
to make it even worse but we thought

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,600
about keeping something which or giving

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:09,910
something which you can keep same for

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:11,920
speakers they have a little Prometheus

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,450
logo what you can oh yes yes yes they're

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,239
actually engraved with the prometheus

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:19,049
level course obviously why wouldn't they

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:23,290
be same as those balls obviously

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:28,260
carsales it would be kind of stupid so

00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:31,510
that is terrible Tom here that kind

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,990
approached me recently asking about

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:38,169
offsetting travel co2 emissions

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:41,710
and I was like a good idea but why not

00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:43,060
200% why why stop it's being carbon

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,580
neutral when you need to go negative

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,970
basically cause else everyone who kept

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,520
their hands on open you know what I mean

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:59,259
up thank you

00:04:50,520 --> 00:05:00,490
English hard yeah so yeah graph Anna

00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,830
doesn't have a booth but they're

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,110
offsetting 200 percent of all travel and

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,729
oil food of everyone coming here we did

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,910
some stats on where people are coming

00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:13,479
from gets constant stats on how much co2

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,190
this this actually means and I think

00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,440
with honor people have some little

00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:29,800
pouches with them which you can even

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:31,360
plant and have some basil I wanted I

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,000
mean I'm involved with quite a few

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,039
conferences I'm going to try and do this

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,509
for more conference as well because I

00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:43,380
mean travel is kind of needed for tech

00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:46,120
that's unfortunate but it is like it is

00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:49,120
on the other hand we can please try and

00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,919
do something you can also try and do

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,990
something so maybe start the

00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,210
conversation at your company offset

00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,009
travel 100 percent to 1 percent 300

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,889
percent maybe you have other things

00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:03,639
which you can offset but start having

00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:06,130
those conversations and yes it's just

00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,930
the subtank so it would be way better to

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,050
just not create any of those emissions

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,099
or waste any of the plastic or whatever

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,169
but if you have to and you honestly

00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:17,500
think you have to then at least try and

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:20,190
do something about it some genetalia

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,419
stuff launches pretty late

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,750
fourteen hundred fourteen fifteen

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:27,909
something basically course of any

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,860
restrictions with all the people working

00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:31,240
here who need to grab food before cuz

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,289
else we have security issues blah blah

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,270
blah

00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:36,610
so during the pauses planned for this

00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,909
that we have pretty late lunch

00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:43,180
on both days we have toilets on both

00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:45,279
sides of this room so please use both

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,430
it's not too many toilets but we'll

00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,430
manage

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,150
that's the password it's also over there

00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,730
if you need it and if your neighbor

00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,640
looks into into the email for you a

00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:00,090
picture a book in their email with the

00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,510
know before you go that's also in there

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:11,470
will there be enough food at the dinner

00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:12,610
dinner social event no no just just so

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,800
everyone knows like that there will be

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:18,160
food yeah there will be food there will

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:24,840
be food obviously but it will probably

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:29,770
be hard to top to top that's pretty hard

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:32,080
oh yeah good great thank you for for

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:35,470
leading it is so if anyone tries to make

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,500
a question into a statement after a talk

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,450
we will shut you down not because very

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,180
evil but because it's really really not

00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,590
fair to do the others in the room if you

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,330
want to make a statement we have a

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,830
lightning talk system you can write

00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,830
yourself in over there it's already

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,210
pretty full but I think we should manage

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:56,230
but please don't abuse the system of

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,540
course it's it just sucks we have a

00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:01,030
color coding system we have almost run

00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:04,060
out of green stickers which is good I

00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,740
just heard someone mentioned that the

00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:11,410
last Microsoft event ran out of red

00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:13,150
stickers so yeah but we have some more

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,070
we have more stickers over there we have

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:18,900
many t-shirts we have met at the

00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:23,200
entrance and we have we have tons more

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:25,000
but not so many green ones if anything

00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,520
is happening just approach anyone with

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,340
one of those green badges which means

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,650
deaf we do have the code of conduct

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,780
which is fine zzf and all of that and we

00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:39,130
