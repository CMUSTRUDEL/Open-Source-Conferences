Title: PromCon EU 2019: Prometheus @ Datacenters - Or Why Modbus Is Even Worse than SNMP
Publication date: 2019-12-29
Playlist: PromCon EU 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Richard "RichiH" Hartmann


The cloud runs on servers, and those live in datacenters. Most everything in datacenters speaks ModBus/TCP; SNMP being considered too modern. Lessons learned and problems overcome along with some nice pictures.

[Music]

00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,960
just for the record if that was in

00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,209
Google slides I wouldn't have made it in

00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,529
that timeframe la tech Beamer all the

00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:23,500
way yes

00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:26,380
anyway I'm reaching I'm pulling area

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,570
center it's one of the most modern in

00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,369
the world it's according to the harshest

00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,700
constricted standard which you can find

00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:36,610
outside of military installations so I

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:41,500
dare say it's it's not crap and I'm

00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:43,780
using my pose for this so I'm going to

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:48,879
refer to SNMP a lot of times so who a

00:00:43,780 --> 00:01:01,510
sort of SNMP I pity you who has heard of

00:00:48,879 --> 00:01:04,170
mothballs okay I pick you so SNMP is

00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:06,820
pretty old as most of you will know

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,580
Matos is way older it's way more

00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:15,370
horrible the test male way more boards

00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:17,710
and and horrible bits and pieces it's

00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,300
fair to say that without SNMP the

00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,850
internet would break down within hours

00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:25,330
of course no one would be able to

00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:27,280
actually manage what the internet is but

00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,340
quite frankly if we didn't have what was

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,640
if that just went away the whole society

00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,590
some people and I'm not joking I mean it

00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:41,020
sounds funny but I'm not joking it is

00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:43,210
ever free there there's no field where

00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,870
you won't find anything which which

00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,100
speaks mumbles it's insane

00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,770
you wouldn't have power you wouldn't

00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,810
have tap water you wouldn't have nothing

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:56,260
ports like those large cranes and such a

00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:58,230
more mumbles ships is the engine running

00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,580
is going backwards forwards or multiples

00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,320
there would be nothing even even

00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:05,860
production streets like your your

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,690
Snickers bar and everything on motors so

00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,989
it's kind of important and it's kind of

00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,400
ignored cause it's horrible and of

00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:14,290
course it has serious security build and

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,300
of course why would you have security in

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,219
something that oh well maybe in

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,379
something that important but you just

00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:22,209
don't and that's something to keep in

00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:24,130
mind course you can't just shoot it in

00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:26,740
after you need to you

00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,880
need to replace the complete the

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:33,520
complete standard basically so there is

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,260
several flavors of Montes the two most

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,910
relevant ones are argue and mottos TCP

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,100
just to increase the pain there's also

00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:47,970
Modbus over TCP which is completely

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:55,150
different from what pass TCP same as FTP

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:56,590
FTPS and SFTP so basically most things

00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,160
you will find today on what those are to

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,590
you most of what you want to be using is

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,980
mottos TCP and there is a way to

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,290
translate this one special mention for

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:13,020
my post what those esky course that's

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:16,360
just double horrible but some people use

00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:19,180
so yeah you want to use multiple TCP and

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,690
bridging RT you into TCP is pretty

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:26,190
common there is a deeply ingrained

00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:28,960
concept of Master and slave within us

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,170
which we got rid of in what was exported

00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,700
for obvious reasons because it's one of

00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,110
those things so just like you put

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,270
someone put it there and you just keep

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,890
using that that name and you don't

00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:42,190
really think about it but it's actually

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:44,020
quite horrible so just don't

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,820
it makes birding a little bit harder

00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,410
course you all of us on you out of your

00:03:45,820 --> 00:04:00,790
standard but quite frankly I think it's

00:03:47,410 --> 00:04:03,820
worth it so let's take in you have

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:06,910
addresses which obviously go to the 65k

00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,950
but why would you use the hex value in

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,320
something which is binary no you're

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:14,290
using decimal of course why wouldn't you

00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:17,500
and obviously you have these ranges

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:20,950
where you precisely define what is

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,890
allowed to be in there and discrete coil

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:26,770
outputs or output coils that means you

00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:29,260
have actual coils which do measurements

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:32,650
on is there power on that line or not

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,680
and that is how you test is this thing

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,300
on or off course in the 70s that's how

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,570
we did that stuff Chris

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,640
you didn't have any other way that's

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,900
very this is coming from that's still

00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:49,180
underlying this protocol so yeah

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:53,110
basically you get bitwise for for the

00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:55,090
first two and bird or two bite cause

00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,560
word didn't exist at a concept or it

00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,210
wasn't clearly defined we're talking

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,580
about the time when they weren't even

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,880
sure if a bite would be seven eight or

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:09,310
stick there or nine bits so or six so

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:12,880
yeah you need to do bitwise addressing

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:16,720
within the stupid block of course why

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,290
wouldn't you and no matter what you do

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,470
you always get two byte blocks back even

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,660
if you ask a sub address it'll just give

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,810
you that whole word of course why

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,750
wouldn't it and you need to really

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:34,050
really like clobber stuff together by

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,050
hand

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:49,900
for example flow 32 I've seen all three

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:56,790
of those on the line and sometimes you

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:56,790
have documentation I didn't see the last

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:12,010
yeah so jumping back to here sorry to

00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:16,180
hear readwrite is output read-only is

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:19,120
input so yes of course it's from the

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,860
perspective of the sender and not from

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,230
the perspective of the actual device

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,650
which you are talking to course it would

00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:28,450
be way too unconfuse if it would be like

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,150
relevant to you actually wise you're

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:35,080
thinking about and obviously you're

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:38,770
skipping zero the decimal zero even

00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:42,130
though you're doing binary and obviously

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,410
you start counting with one at that's

00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,480
binary zero but only if they feel like

00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:49,810
it course within the Nano fields it's

00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,620
not define in to whatever like it's not

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,990
even

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,860
anything it's just free-for-all you can

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:58,570
just put in whatever you have also the

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,610
possibility to just use the other

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,830
addresses no one is stopping you there

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,150
is no test suite which won't fail or

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:08,800
anything you can do this if you want

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:12,699
there's one very very simple way to

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:17,530
verify if if you did it correctly stuff

00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:19,090
breaks easy it just stops working maybe

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,470
your I don't know power plant explodes

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,560
and then you know okay I did something

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,560
wrong

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,590
maybe someone dies I don't know maybe

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:30,430
you're cooling in the data center stops

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:35,440
and everything's on fire and yeah it's a

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:38,410
quite high stakes game to play and the

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,160
reminder again you wouldn't have water

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:47,830
or anything if mod was just went away so

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:50,850
who has heard of SNMP myths good maps

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:54,100
are similar just not defined as anything

00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:57,880
like there's no you know standard for

00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,440
for them you can't test them and the way

00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,570
to find out if you actually did

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,660
something wrong this stuff just breaks

00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:07,090
because sometimes even if you just read

00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,039
out the wrong register the PLC decides

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,130
okay I don't know that register best

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:15,789
thing to do just stop

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:16,900
of course why wouldn't you so yeah you

00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:20,919
have to be really really really careful

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,960
and yes this is not a joke I got

00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,030
documentation which is basically a scan

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,220
of old photocopy paper because it's an

00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,800
old controller why would you update the

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,870
documentation it's still good paper from

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:41,279
the 70s if you looked at those are RFC's

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:41,279
that looks like it it's lorries

00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,250
I've seen the people who've worked with

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,230
this and this is industry standard do

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,420
you have your hex viewer which is able

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:54,510
to speak one pose are to you and or what

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,730
does TCP you have a mapper or maybe you

00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:59,220
don't you have an excel sheet where you

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,350
define your your stuff which you want to

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,600
read out your signal list as they call

00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:08,220
it and then you just need to endless

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,740
amount of time taking those if you have

00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,690
somewhat sane maps it's relatively easy

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:17,070
to see me automatically turn this into

00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:19,110
configuration which is good but no one I

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,530
ever met who is doing this for actual

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,570
day work ever does they don't do

00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:29,420
everything by hand and they start at

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:32,990
zero every single time why wouldn't they

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:36,390
so what do you use is for data centers

00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:43,680
everything except the cameras they speak

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:46,980
SLP but this is a list it's really

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,660
really everything and yes we have

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,120
bulletproof vests in two of the rooms

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:55,440
and yes if you shoot at this bulletproof

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:59,040
glass I'll see this through what was of

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,040
course obviously everything which is

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,320
relevant to this data center is read out

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:09,090
by mulpus which is kind of scary to be

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:15,720
honest that Isis is not complete so why

00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:18,210
am I doing this I like pain no seriously

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,150
it's the only thing which I found which

00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:25,190
is supported by even half of those of

00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:28,830
those machines many of them can do SNMP

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:32,100
all of them except the cameras can do

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:34,830
one pose like everything access control

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:40,140
intrusion alert fire suppression

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:43,200
everything so it's super horrible it

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,450
really really is it really really is but

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,520
it's also very reliable quite simply

00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:51,120
because people would die if it wasn't so

00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:54,209
that's quite good motivator for you

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,550
and there is an exporter this version

00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:59,360
you only want to use this version it

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,620
actually follows promises best practices

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,870
the other stuff which you'll find online

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:08,149
is not following this if you have

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:10,860
anything in your data center or your

00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:13,019
orders shipping coming in okay

00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,240
that's the stuff which you want to work

00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:19,559
on thanks to Max who's not here he's in

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:22,589
Paris if you have any sorry I can go

00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:27,980
there if you have anything using are to

00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:32,220
you I highly highly highly suggest that

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:34,499
you get a PLC as a gateway to put this

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,749
into TCP there is actually a low library

00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:40,079
which allows you to directly connect

00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:43,290
serial controllers to Modbus RTU you

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,540
don't want to do this I kind of you

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,370
you'll see it in the in the slides but I

00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,920
kind of skipped over the point of hard

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:54,089
real-time good point who knows what hard

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,800
real-time is okay so there's the concept

00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,459
of soft and hard real-time soft this

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,019
basically best effort or good effort and

00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:04,050
hard real-time is unless it's perfect

00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:07,860
things explode what boss are to you is

00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:09,749
hard right huh so I really really

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,720
recommend you don't touch this with

00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:14,309
software I use PLC's which are which are

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,980
certified for this in which which I

00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:20,939
actually gear for this

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:24,059
what's a PLC program programmable logic

00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:27,660
controller I think it's basically what

00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:31,860
I'm thinking basically what you write or

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,350
burn the firmware like yeah

00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:40,519
so not even FPGA or anything is like

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:43,740
really really fifteen yeah

00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,779
caveat reading out multiples sometimes

00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,550
takes several seconds even a small

00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,670
controller can take like six or twelve

00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,589
seconds to just read out a few bellows

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,910
which in turn means you have to take

00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:58,019
this into account especially with

00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:59,759
premises for the PLC's which I'm using

00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:03,540
I'm currently having them reprogrammed

00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:05,069
to expose the time how long they took to

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,959
read this out

00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:08,730
of course again they have hard hard real

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,220
time internally so they know precisely

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,600
how long it took they have no idea what

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,100
I should want the ancient times they

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,929
don't know if it's 100 years ago or 100

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,579
years in the future I don't care but

00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:19,499
they're not precisely how long it took

00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:21,989
well that's once they're what they're

00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:24,269
exposing Brian hates me for saying that

00:13:21,989 --> 00:13:32,639
I might adapt the exporter to to

00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:37,829
calculate correct time but yeah I can

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:43,079
work with that there is something of a

00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:47,790
C's we ish thing which you can use for

00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:50,359
maps and many not all but quite a few of

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:53,999
the manufacturers for for equipment

00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:56,160
follow this I wouldn't dare to call it

00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:59,009
standard but it's it's it's not that

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,189
horrible and I actually want to have

00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:03,480
like anyone who knows it's an in peak

00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:07,259
sport and how to generator works

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:10,169
something very I define I out those bits

00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:14,220
and pieces and it turns that into valid

00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:17,249
configuration of course it's it's super

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:22,079
super super horrible to do by hand it

00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:27,239
works but it takes ages yeah just a

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:29,489
reminder again you never like maybe 60

00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:31,350
maybe 80% of people in this room hadn't

00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:33,480
heard of what goes before but quite

00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:38,540
honestly without this society wouldn't

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:42,389
work for glass like 50 years or 40 we

00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:44,449
would collapse I hope you have lots of

00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:44,449
questions

00:14:49,580 --> 00:15:00,030
and give any questions I'm just really

00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,220
curious did you really test the

00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:13,110
bulletproof glass and easy shootin did

00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:15,150
you see it on there but I'm one of so

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:19,260
for the normal security relevant rooms

00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:23,940
we have I try my transition to us which

00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:25,740
is basically break proof glass we

00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,650
actually have two layers of that in the

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,650
non-security relevant rules and one of

00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:33,480
those glass panes broke so I didn't do

00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:37,500
this yet but I intend to take a glass

00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,360
breaker and - to break it and see it pop

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:50,730
up I didn't have time to do this here

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:56,370
yes yes expensive it's it's medium for

00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:57,780
figures it's like super also like the

00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,670
frame and everything also needs to

00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,180
people to proof in you so you can't

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,180
shoot this

00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:09,000
I think the modbus exporters super cool

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,740
I think is a great way to bridge your

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,120
really old traditional like the

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,040
industrial world which runs everything

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,720
like he pointed out - like the modern

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,550
prometheus world have you seen other

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,380
people use something like this or do

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:25,800
something similar to other protocols or

00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:28,320
other industrial systems yes I think the

00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:32,250
university project where we formed this

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:40,070
room so that person used it for

00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:44,700
something I know that they also use it

00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:46,740
the old version version there is most

00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,780
certainly others I felt around a little

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,970
bit and there was some some feedback on

00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,940
the question of what bus and then

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:56,400
fermitas I did talk to a few people

00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,510
recently who who were also trying to get

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,570
all this observability

00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,920
world on the Industrial Workers if you

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,110
look at the licensing model and if you

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,329
look at the scalability and like the

00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:09,880
performance of all the old industrial

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:12,400
style visibility monitoring

00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,319
observability tools they are horrible we

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,140
are talking high five figures for like

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,290
five thousand data points and that's

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:23,199
every minute or maybe every two minutes

00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:30,010
yes so there's tons and tons of meat I

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:31,870
expect this to become bigger so just to

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,540
understand the basic thing that my bus

00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,669
exporter does is it basically you're

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,820
reading all of the out all of the

00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:42,130
registers in succession and storing the

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,260
buffering native values or how do you

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,990
handle situations where it takes too

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,150
long to or maybe not too long but a long

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,590
time to read all of them or if there are

00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:57,520
side effects to reading any of the

00:17:50,590 --> 00:18:01,030
registers so basically yes so I have the

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,690
configuration if you know do you know so

00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:07,330
I have a configuration if you access

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,480
that module in the exporter I will send

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,790
queries to that device ask for whatever

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,530
is in the configuration use the

00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:16,540
configuration to turn this into stuff

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:20,020
which promises understands and exposing

00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:24,610
thing and that can take a short time or

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:32,520
a long time doesn't matter do we have

00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:34,300
any more questions all right thank you

00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,370
yeah thank you

00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:48,089
[Applause]
