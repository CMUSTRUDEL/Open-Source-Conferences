farnacles and putting them on youtube

00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,080
and they're getting a lot of views

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,240
actually

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,839
um i'm now not saying the cortex one

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,040
will but i think we should record them

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,120
and make them available because not

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,799
everyone can make this time zone right

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,160
yep cool all right i've started it

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,920
recording um

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,840
i'm also in the prometheus dev summit so

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,080
i'm probably gonna bounce back to that

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,520
and just leave this recording but talk

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,680
to you all later

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,680
just chris thanks

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,760
i think mean um my advice this this only

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,160
affects

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,600
single large tenants i think the

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,600
compaction thing

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,040
um i think my advice right now is don't

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,399
run single large tenants run smaller

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,239
tenants we have the

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,239
multi-tenant querying and stuff which

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,280
means you can that's one workaround

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,120
another workaround is run your

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,160
compactors on bigger machines faster

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,079
machines

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,680
um but in general cortex uh you know

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,719
prometheus compaction is

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,120
single threaded and and is a pain and

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,000
improvements upstream will help this but

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,120
i think it needs

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,719
like bigger architectural changes and i

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,120
we don't have the scope to do them at

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,120
the moment

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,479
so yeah i just i found the slack thread

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,560
where eugene was saying

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,520
maybe they i don't know where they work

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,240
or whatever but

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,720
maybe they would um do some work on it

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,080
so

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,720
so we should reply great

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,439
please do yeah um it do you know what

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,880
timezone is

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,240
uh eugene's in maybe uh you can join

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,600
this next time and

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,520
and talk about his plans like i'd love

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,560
to love to hear his proposals

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,000
7 45 a.m

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,360
makes it in east coast

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,920
right so yeah our time zone

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,920
oh okay

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,520
all right uh what's next

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,680
uh josh sharding

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
hey everyone um just a quick fyi that i

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,840
have open up a proposal

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
um to do some work on the other manager

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,480
to make it more scalable um i know marco

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,160
has reviewed it and jacob as well

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,879
um i'm just wondering anyone else has

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,920
more questions

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,360
and please just like give it a look um

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,959
there's a lot to digest because it's a

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,080
pretty big architectural change

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,000
um just drop by any questions and let me

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,280
know

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,080
yes i know like i talked to you i've

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,239
never actually put them on the github pr

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,239
um but i think it looks generally good

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,040
from my point of view but also like i

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,160
am not a super experienced and anger

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,280
manager and roller user at this point

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,879
we're still getting there but so it

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,319
would probably benefit from people that

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,879
are running this in production already

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,879
having a look

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,840
you want to give a brief overview josh

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:08,720
of the design

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,280
um is there anything we can share to put

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,040
a

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,959
diagram by any chance um

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,840
the design dock uh linked or is it

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,840
always in markdown now

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,239
we drew all those really pretty images

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,239
people need to share

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,680
yeah sure thank you sure just going to

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,680
share the the google doc if that's all

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,239
right because

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,239
i don't know how to view github images

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:52,159
so this is how it works right now

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,720
basically all alert managers handle all

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,799
tenants

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,840
and there's three-way replication and

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,280
this is pretty much

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,959
i mean you can replicate it as many ways

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,640
as you like it uses gossip but

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,840
there's not much point in replicating it

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,120
beyond this you're not actually getting

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,560
scalability

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,879
um and the proposal

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,920
this design docks in the pr but the

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,120
proposal is effectively to

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,120
this is not going to come as a surprise

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
to anyone is to apply the cortex ring to

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,239
this

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,560
and to shard by tenant we're going to

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,079
embed an alert manager distributor into

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,360
the alert manager binary

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,919
we're going to route um the gossip

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,800
via the rear of the ring and over grpc

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,880
um so that

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,280
you know you you got it only to your

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,320
that tenant to that replica set

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,400
um and we want to put the state

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,240
so the you know periodically flush

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,520
silences and things like that into

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,240
an s3 bucket

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,759
there's a lot of detail to this right um

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,639
and the details in the design dock but

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,919
this is the

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,919
the rough the rough plan

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,840
yep that sounds accurate

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,320
any questions any comments i would

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,980
suggest to make sure that we use

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,600
thanos object client for this work yes

00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:13,120
[Laughter]

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,800
the i guess the thing to state this

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,080
won't allow you this will still have

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,400
like compaction right this will still

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,880
have the one very very large tenant

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,039
doing

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,320
billions of alerts a second this doesn't

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,840
solve that problem right

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,880
this solves the i have a hundred

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,880
thousand tenants problem

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,560
um there's you know there's a whole

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,639
bunch of different options and

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,240
trade-offs here but

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,520
i think this is the i think this is

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,800
relatively straightforward and obvious

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,440
myself to be honest

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,240
so is this other problem on the horizon

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,160
like is it

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,440
is that going to be solved at some point

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,520
as well

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,120
i mean you've got other issues if you're

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,320
sending hundreds of thousands of alerts

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,360
a second

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,560
okay like let's go to real people right

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,160
like also i mean our analysis of alert

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,479
manager right now

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:06,080
is um where is it here we go

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,880
you know we can handle 700

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,600
plus in a relatively modest uh alert

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,440
manager

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:17,039
we can handle like 700 plus tenants

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,160
um so it's not it's not a huge burning

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,400
issue i don't think

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,160
um but you know obviously we'd like

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,160
every component in cortex to be scalable

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,080
yeah we've had we've even had like users

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,440
with like 400 active alerts at the same

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,280
time and

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,720
there's no significant increase from

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,720
just from that user alone as well

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,080
for the time being we i personally think

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,000
it's not necessarily a

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,520
big problem but you never know right

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,120
[Music]

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,560
i mean it'd be a problem if you start

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
going to tens or hundreds of thousands

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,080
of tenants we

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,400
you know for sure but at the scale that

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,960
we run cortex at

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,960
it's not it's not challenging but

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:15,919
all right thank you no worries

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,440
um do we have anyone to speak about 1.6

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,120
where is jacob let me see if i can

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,880
he might actually i think jacob is on

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,280
vacation actually

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,240
um i haven't seen any progress on this

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,440
release so

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,440
perhaps there are no news

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,880
well that probably means it's after the

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,199
new year now

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,199
does it

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,680
it's a fair bit i

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,479
yeah i will work early next week um

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,680
so i will get back to jacob in case i

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,120
can take over

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,039
uh the release and i can

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,360
um and they can release the stable

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,360
version

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,840
yeah if we could get an rco um before

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,840
christmas and then

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,479
there is rc zero out is there was it a

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,479
pizza pizza

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,840
so he watched them i meant no using rcu

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,840
right yeah there is rc0

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,479
well that's a bit of status we could

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,080
write down

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:30,639
rc0 is already out

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,639
out is anyone running it

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,959
yeah we do since a couple of weeks this

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:40,000
is the second week we're running it

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,680
oh well i shall well it'll already have

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,760
been been and gone in our staging

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,320
environment but i'll i'll stick it into

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,320
production

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
okay

00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,680
all right i think we came to the end of

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,720
the things that were written in the

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,000
agenda

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,760
anyone else got any thoughts

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,880
uh i actually hi i am dhruv uh

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,440
recently uh signed up for this i'm

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,560
just reading about the cortex uh i would

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,600

like to

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:48,839

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,399
prometheus area if there is a scope and

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,480
possibility nice

yeah sure yeah thank you uh i

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,279
i have uh experience in uh distributed

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,120
systems back in distributed systems

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,880
maybe i'll give you a little overview of

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,880
what i have been doing uh

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:14,720
so i work i started working

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,360
uh my first job was at oracle

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,240
where i spent three years building uh

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,000
infrastructure

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,760
related stuff application security

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,079
infrastructure and then i worked at

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,480
splunk for five years basically uh

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,079
focusing on back-end distribute system

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,680
like clustering and indexing

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,680
uh data application that area and uh

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,200
after that uh uh i ventured into a

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,399
couple of startups you know there's a

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,600
company called cribble

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,480
uh uh that i worked there like

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,600
was a very early engineer there uh uh

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,120
recently rejoined

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,040
splunk uh in indexing team

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,480
so that's where i am so i have

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,440
experience in back-end distributed

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,839
systems

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:59,279
um yeah nice are you uh

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,640
do you work with chris uh no

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,320
i think we are in completely different

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,959
teams i just happened to see his name

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,800
today

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,079
uh i would like to chat with him after

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,839
the call

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:12,160
yes yeah so uh

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,920
the reason the way uh how i got to know

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,480
about cortex and

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,959
cortex is because one of my teams was

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,000
using

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,040
grafana and cortex we are clients for

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,279
the team that host

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,720
i think probably christie might be the

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,000
one who might be running it

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,200
we are just using it so that's how i got

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,760
to read more about cortex and uh grafana

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,760
in general like so that's why i felt

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,959
like maybe i can contribute

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,839
that's great welcome um we we're we're

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,800
dying out for

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,079
for contributions um there's two i've if

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,519
you've got access to the notes

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,920
which are on the invite but i'll paste

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,200
oh they're in the chat as well oh no not

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,279
there there's a link to the notes in the

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,079
chat um

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,639
there's uh two links two tags we use uh

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,320
one is

00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,000
help wanted and one is hacktoberfest um

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,519
and good first issues oh they're good

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,680
first issues as well nice where's

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,040
that one yeah i was gonna say we're sort

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,839
of having a fight in the notes

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,440
over uh there's a lot more good first

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,000
issues than there are hacktoberfest

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,720
although they

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,720
they pretty much overlap in the um

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,680
you know if you look at both of them

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,959
uh they're they're a little variable

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,360
um i would say

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,279
but some of the things like like uh like

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,480
supporting jaeger endpoint for instance

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,680
you know that's i think a

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,399
pretty simple bit of config

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,360
might be nice first issue or http

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,440
endpoint to show overrides

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,360
i would i would vote for http endpoint

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,639
to show overrides i'd love that one

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:51,120
that was by i mean tom wilkie

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,120
yeah okay sure

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,320
okay http there must be jira for that i

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,600
think that

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,279
yeah we have issues yeah that uh

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,079
if you can find your way to the notes

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:06,480
and um find your way from there to those

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,839
uh queries on github um

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,720
when you clean notes are you referring

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,120
to the written notes or notes

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,120
notes yeah the the document the cortex

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,560
community meeting working doc

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,600
okay yeah sure i'll take a look at it

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,720
for sure yeah yeah

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,399
i'd vote for 1324 too or

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:30,399
um you know come into our slack say hi

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:33,760
um the thing is a big it's a big system

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,600
right so so you very likely to have

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,880
questions when you first

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,160
get into it um there's plenty of small

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,920
things for the ruler and the alarm

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,680
manager if you ping me on slack i can

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,240
direct you to some of them

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,320
okay okay and i think another thing is

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,920
really valuable is where we have not

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,399
written down what the problem is but you

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,920
know as a newcomer

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,600
you're going to stumble over certain

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,079
things and it would just be so valuable

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,600
if

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,279
you put a little something in the docs

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,399
or in the readme or something like that

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,519
like for the next

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,720
new person sure uh

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,720
because once you've been doing it three

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,519
weeks you'll have totally lost all

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,079
memory of

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,600
what was so hard about getting started

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,079
you'll be you'll be in the really hard

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,279
stuff

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,199
but uh i think it's really valuable for

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,240
a newcomer to contribute that way just

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,079
just for the next person yeah sure i'll

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,360
i'll try to come up with something so

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,399
i spent uh some time reading stuff i was

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,079
trying to figure out like

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,600
what would be the right entry point

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,199
right like so

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,199
uh i i don't directly work on uh

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,639
this uh like you know cortex or promise

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,800
this is my daily job

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,320
right so i thought maybe i'm missing

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,399
that thing

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,639
where if i know let's say if i'm working

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,279
in a time team which handles lot of

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,720
large scale clusters then i get to know

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,680
about some problems where i can

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,079
contribute

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,920
right i was missing that so i was

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,639
looking for that experience

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,800
in general like i was trying to see how

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,120
i can bridge that gap

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,000
but i think looking at small issues and

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,399
then

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,199
crawling up would be the alternative

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,600
approach as well

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,760
i believe yeah yeah

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,120
yeah i mean it's it's kind of difficult

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,600
um

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,000
the bigger the bigger things need

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,199
coordination it's it's quite hard to

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,560
predict how long well even for the

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,519
people who are very experienced it's

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,440
hard to predict but at least

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,160
if we if we kind of know someone's

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,759
capability then we're willing to commit

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,959
um so i guess that's why we tend to say

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,959
start with the small things and

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,639
yeah it makes sense once you've uh once

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,680
you've picked off a few small things and

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,160
got comfortable

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,759
running and contributing my only

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,440
suggestion would be when before you do

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,920
tackle any large uh

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,920
larger changes write a design doc um

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,639
submit a pr with a markdown document

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,160
with like

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,079
you know a clear problem statement an

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,160
analysis and a proposal

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,160
um like you know the uh josh's alert

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,720
manager wants a good design

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,160
um you know and there's uh we're

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,440
starting to

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,880
put more and more design docs in

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,320
markdown so that there's also the

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,279
history of all the design docs that have

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,320
gone on and

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:20,839
all the proposed changes sure okay cool

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,959
makes sense yeah thank you no thank you

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,800
yeah did i just read that you're at

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,360
splunk as well

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,320
yeah i i joined splunk like a couple of

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,519
months ago in

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,959
in september okay cool i will reach out

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,160
to you at slack and get you set up on

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,759
our cortex stuff

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,279
sure sorry i'm only mostly recording

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,320
