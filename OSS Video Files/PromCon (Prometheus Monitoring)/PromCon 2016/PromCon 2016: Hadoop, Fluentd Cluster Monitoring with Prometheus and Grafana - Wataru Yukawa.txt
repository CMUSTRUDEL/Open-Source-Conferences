Title: PromCon 2016: Hadoop, Fluentd Cluster Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana - Wataru Yukawa
Publication date: 2016-09-04
Playlist: PromCon 2016
Description: 
	* Abstract:

At LINE, we are creating and maintaining a log analysis platform on top of Hadoop, Hive, and Fluentd. We were unsatisfied with existing monitoring systems like Ganglia and Nagios and recently started using Prometheus and Grafana. We especially liked Prometheus's powerful query language, unified monitoring and alerting, as well as the pull-based architecture. We created Prometheus exporters for Hadoop and jstat and fluentd, and are also using Node Exporter to monitor machine-level metrics. For access and application log metrics, we use fluent-plugin-prometheus. This talk presents our use case.
