years involved in that and others open

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,359

00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,609
haha slide so if anybody wants to

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,460

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,489
everything so um i used to work at

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,579
Google like many of the people working

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:42,030
prometheus I was in love with Berman

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:45,920
back in the day and then when I went

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,570
back to real world I was a bit desperate

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,170
because of all that could find was not

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,610
yes so as soon as I heard the

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,160
announcement that jumped in at least the

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,070
IRC channel and I started contributing a

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,039
my contribution is maintaining

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:06,540
prometheus Ford again and through dull

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:09,390
Tony to Boone 21 other distributions and

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,340
now i'm not working any company anymore

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,590
so i'm not offering to hire anybody but

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,840
a freelancer's is anybody needs one here

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:23,159
m m so first of all who cares about

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:27,720
debian m nowadays i get a lot of slack

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:30,659
about distributions especially when you

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,670
see projects that end up in dot IO and

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,979
stuff like that distributions is all

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:41,340
stuff for all people yes Logan well and

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,810
it's not shiny so as somebody said today

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,020
earlier don't believe everything you

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,729
read in happen is the the reports of the

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,720
death of distributions are greatly

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,399
greatly exaggerated basically not

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,170
everybody can afford the image software

00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:01,290
and lack of some kind of quality control

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:06,030
and proper integrations and certain sick

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:09,060
game security support their trade of

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,530
course distributions are so especially

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,150
debian with the slowest of them all

00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:18,580
and the Dave the stable releases is

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:21,280
usually done every two years but you

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,350
have backports actually a halt any more

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,450
like that but you can have more

00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,760
up-to-date software but using but black

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,950
person for personal computers I run

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,360
testing or unstable so that's actually

00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:37,720
bleeding edge software on my laptop

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:41,230
right now so promises in debian i been

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,570
working on this for being half now since

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,320
neither these are very very good

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,810
supporting for parameters in debian

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,700
instead of having to download a packet

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:55,330
package or thur ball or something from

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,069
github or whatever you can get installed

00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,720
Prometheus right now and if you do that

00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:02,200
you actually get a parameters that works

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,420
out of the box with some saying default

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,400
settings of course you'll need to trick

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,700
for your own needs but you can start

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,620
parameters in 30 seconds prometheus is

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,540
packaged the other manager the push

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,450
gateway are ready to be installed and

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:19,090
the all every actually big from field by

00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:22,810
default to talk to each other and they

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:25,840
not gay and they notice porter to the

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,630
goal library is there python library at

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,959
the kind libraries I mean the chango

00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:35,650
integration is there a few exporters

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,980
like MongoDB my sequel well the notes

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:42,190
Porter 14 p qi bouncer which is

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:45,250
something for something Aaron died of a

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,959
sudden Reno and they see advice order

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,290
that they can also be intervene to

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,320
Prometheus and entail a package to and

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:56,170
after Rena belt grok a actually think I

00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,370
gonna package that soon because my

00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:03,700
experience with em tell was not very

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:06,370
good it crashes all the time so I try to

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,829
keep the package is very very up-to-date

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,260
with upstream so when there's an

00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:13,690
announcement for our release I try to do

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,329
that in the next few days not more than

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:19,630
a week or two and that's up that's

00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:23,050
unstable but after five days if there is

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,880
no big issues that becomes testing so if

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,980
you're running testing every you can

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,120
you can use it and since these are go

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:32,890
package is actually very easy to just a

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,870
have installed packages from testing

00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,060
from the packages from testing into your

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,410
stable server because it's not many

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,660
problems will address or something which

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,740
is usually a headache if you're trying

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:47,920
to mix distributions and also work in a

00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:51,220
back porting the whole stack em but

00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:55,050
that's a lot of work I'm working on that

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:57,280
so any help is welcomed I have a real a

00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,040
couple of exports testing are we there

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,010
and so many libraries but still didn't

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,190
get the whole primitives so yeah help is

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,670
welcome and yeah just up get installed

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,670
