	00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:06,750
from current 2016 is the first-ever

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,760
conference around the Prometheus

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,500
monitoring system and the goal is to

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,150
bring together people from all around

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,940
the world from companies large and small

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,619
who are using Prometheus to bring them

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,720
all together here in Berlin in this room

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,490
to give talks about how they're using

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,039
Prometheus what they are building around

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,869
Prometheus to exchange experiences and

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,680
then also build a community around the

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:31,199
system that is amazing and I'm really

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,850
happy that this even came to be since I

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,170
mean it's the first one and then

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,630
obviously there won't be more because

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,940
it's been really great so far a lot of

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,500
interesting speakers have come and

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,750
presented all types and ways on how to

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,969
use Prometheus and I'm really really

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,559
happy to be here I was probably one of

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,210
the best conferences I've ever been to

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,620
it's very rare that you go to a

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,090
conference and you're like sitting on

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,719
the edge of your seat because you want

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,219
to hear every single talk great variety

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,989
of people all doing different kings of

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,660
Prometheus and everyone learning from -

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,690
just great to see

00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,700

00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,570
