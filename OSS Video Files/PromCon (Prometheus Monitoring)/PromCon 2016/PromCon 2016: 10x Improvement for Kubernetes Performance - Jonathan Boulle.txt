Description: 
	* Abstract:

Scalability is one of the important factors that make a successful distributed system. At CoreOS, we love Kubernetes and help drive the project forward through upstream contributions. Learn how we analyzed Kubernetes cluster performance to gain insight into cluster behavior under large workloads and learn where there are performance issues. See how we used Prometheus for improving Kubernetes scheduler performance by 10x.
