Title: PromCon 2016: Full Stack Metrics with Triton's Native Prometheus Support - Richard Kiene, Tim Gross

	* Abstract

Triton is the open source data center automation solution that powers public cloud and private data centers world-wide. In early 2016, Joyent undertook a project to expose infrastructure and system for every instance — including infrastructure containers, Docker containers, and hardware virtual machines — using a Prometheus-compatible agent. The project, called Triton Container Monitor and described in our public request for discussion, https://github.com/joyent/rfd/blob/master/rfd/0027/README.md, takes advantage of container-native architecture, kstats, and other native introspection tools.

Additionally, developers need tools to expose up-stack application metrics to Prometheus. ContainerPilot, the open source, application-centric micro-orchestrator that makes it easy to build and operate portable application containers, now features a Prometheus-compatible telemetry interface to monitor application performance with user-defined probes. This interface brings monitoring directly to the container and eliminates the dependence on complex host monitoring for application-specific details.

In this session, Container Monitor lead engineer Richard Kiene will discuss the challenges and successes of implementing Prometheus as a native interface in Triton, and ContainerPilot lead engineer Tim Gross will demonstrate ContainerPilot telemetry and discuss the application-level decisions around defining metrics to drive application scaling.
