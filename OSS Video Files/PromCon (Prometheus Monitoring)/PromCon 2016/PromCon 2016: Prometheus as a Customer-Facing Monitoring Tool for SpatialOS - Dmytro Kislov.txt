Title: PromCon 2016: Prometheus as a Customer-Facing Monitoring Tool for SpatialOS - Dmytro Kislov
Publication date: 2016-09-04
Playlist: PromCon 2016
Description: 
	* Abstract:

At Improbable we provide a platform for spatially distributed simulations to our customers. We use Prometheus for monitoring our internal microservice stack, but also offer it as a first class customer-facing system on our platform. As far as we know, we are currently running one of the largest Prometheus set ups, with multiple clusters of federated Prometheus stacks. Given the nature of the simulations built by our users, monitoring becomes their go-to tool for debugging and troubleshooting. Since our customer facing Prometheus stack is multitenant, we have also implemented monitoring data isolation based on ACLs.

In this talk we will be discussing our federation set up and monitoring data isolation.
