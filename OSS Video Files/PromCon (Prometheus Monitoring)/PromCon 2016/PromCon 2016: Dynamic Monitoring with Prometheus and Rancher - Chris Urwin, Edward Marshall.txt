Description: 
	* Abstract:

Both Prometheus and Rancher have extremely active communities and were born from the same requirement to support the newer dynamic infrastructures.

This talk will focus on how Rancher and its community are leveraging the power of Prometheus for monitoring both hosts and applications, and how we are leveraging Prometheus's dynamic server discovery to minimise the amount of static configuration and maintenance.
