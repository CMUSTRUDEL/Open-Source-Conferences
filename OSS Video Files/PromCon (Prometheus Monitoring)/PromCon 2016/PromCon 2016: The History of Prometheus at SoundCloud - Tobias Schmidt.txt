Title: PromCon 2016: The History of Prometheus at SoundCloud - Tobias Schmidt
Publication date: 2016-09-04
Playlist: PromCon 2016
Description: 
	* Abstract:

The way SoundCloud monitors its services and infrastructure has dramatically changed over the last couple of years. Monitoring, alerting, and being on-call is now deeply ingrained in every engineering team and we have learned a lot on the way.

This talk will describe our transition from an ops team to a "you build it, you own it" approach, why we needed something like Prometheus, as well as how Prometheus helped us to achieve that and highlight a few success and failure stories.

* Speaker biography:

Tobias Schmidt is a production engineer at SoundCloud and an active contributor to the Prometheus ecosystem. Over the last few years he has helped to integrate Prometheus in SoundCloud's infrastructure and worked with product teams to gain more insight into their services.
