Title: PromCon 2016: Prometheus Design and Philosophy - Why It Is the Way It Is - Julius Volz
Publication date: 2016-09-04
Playlist: PromCon 2016
Description: 
	* Abstract:

Prometheus is an opinionated monitoring system that chooses to do a lot of things differently from traditional monitoring systems. This leads to a culture clash for those used to other approaches, and raises questions as to why we didn't take a seemingly better approach. This talk focuses on the "why" behind many of the design decisions that are core to Prometheus, including pull vs. push, the dimensional data model, relabeling, per-process exporters, stateful client libraries, as well as aspects like metric naming conventions and having a non-distributed storage as a design goal.

* Speaker biography:

Julius co-founded Prometheus and lead the project to success at SoundCloud and beyond. He now focuses on growing the Prometheus community and is the main organizer of PromCon 2016. In a previous life, Julius was a Site Reliability Engineer at Google.
