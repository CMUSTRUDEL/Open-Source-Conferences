Monitoring at Scale: Migrating to Prometheus at Fastly


Over the past 6 months at Fastly we've migrated away from our legacy monitoring systems and have deployed Prometheus as our primary system for infrastructure and application monitoring.

The Prometheus approach posed some unique challenges over traditional monitoring systems, whilst at the same time enabling us to easily scale our monitoring infrastructure alongside our global network growth.

It hasn't been completely smooth sailing and deploying Prometheus across a globe spanning network serving over 10% of the world's internet traffic has raised its fair share of challenges both technical and cultural.

In this presentation you will learn how we addressed these issues in ways that deviate slightly from conventional wisdom, the mistakes we made along the way, and how the new system has been received by our teams. We hope that our experiences can help you succeed in deploying Prometheus within your organization.
