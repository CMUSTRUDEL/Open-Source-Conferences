00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,240
Rahm Cohen was originally an idea that

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,240
came up three years ago sometime in

00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,100
winter when I thought okay we have a

00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,320
certain growth in the parameters project

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,060
itself now it would be really good to

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,559
bring together all the people from

00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,600
around the world who are starting to use

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,880
it who are starting to contribute into a

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,770
place where they can all share knowledge

00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,480
and experience connections between

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,120
people are important because most

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,010
province and tech are not that hard the

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,009
really hard issues are people problems

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,110
like if you misunderstand someone or if

00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:12,150
you just don't get their intention and

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,979
then these misunderstandings or maybe

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,810
not seeing the common shared goals which

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,060
in truth you would have if you were just

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,890
talking differently this is something

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,260
where like this personal contact just

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:30,970
can really help

00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:30,970
[Music]

00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,640
it's important to have community events

00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:40,070
like this to get people together and

00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,990
actually put a face to your name you can

00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,820
have discussions online all you want but

00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,370
like actually sitting down having a chat

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,870
maybe having a beer or soda or tea that

00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,580
really connects people and this

00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,940
connection lasts way beyond the actual

00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,940
meeting

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,659
[Music]

00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,700
so I heard about prometheus through Q

00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,260
Khan and then I was a scholarship

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,150
recipient there and got to meet Brian

00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,970
and asked him all the questions about

00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:11,900
logging and monitoring and so I read the

00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:13,370
the pre-release book and then ironically

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,020
I came back to Honeywell and they said

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,330
hey we want to move forward with using

00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,360
more open source that is secure and I

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,950
saw Prometheus on there the first

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,970
instantiation was really small 80 people

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,630
now we are at 220 it's going really

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,880
great

00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:31,459
we really see that people are starting

00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,680
to use primitives in way bigger scales

00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:36,950
and much more serious ways in really big

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,690
companies even banks then you know we

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,900
might have anticipated a couple of years

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:43,640
ago and we are now at a point where we

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,800
really have to think about growing the

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,690
conference because so many people were

00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,940
not able to attend because of the size

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,920
the main reason for people to attend

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,590
conferences like this is not even the

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,239
toxin of their content it's just talking

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,739
to other people hearing about their

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,900
problems maybe proposing a solution

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:01,760
hearing solutions from them and just

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,810
connecting on a person and an entire

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,810
technological level

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,170
you actually can be an engineer you can

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,630
solve problems you don't sit around

00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,060
complaining you say you know what I want

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,040
to do something about it and you create

00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,950
something awesome so that's what's cool

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,750
about it you you make an imprint around

00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,000
the world I think this is prom Commons

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,020
fantastic mean so good almost as good as

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,490
last year's but you know unfortunately

00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:33,230
 and tricky Turkey now this year's

00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,450
prom Khan was absolutely awesome it's

00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,830
nice to see so many people so many

00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,960
familiar faces it really does feel like

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,820
a family and I always get really super

00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,070
motivated to do more work on prometheus

00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,300
after every pond con so I've got so many

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,460
ideas for things I'm going to go back

00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,840
and do okay I hope these are gonna be

00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,090
bloopers

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,389
[Laughter]

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,389
