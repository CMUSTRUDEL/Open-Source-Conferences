	00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:20,230
so what arrived yeah so a few of you

00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:25,599
have been asking me like how are things

00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:27,699
going and like stressed and something

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,260
people always like they take interest of

00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:30,849
which actually happens behind the scenes

00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,160
and disregarding all the usual stuff

00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:37,449
like keeping a lid up on all the things

00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,430
just like the last few days so tons of

00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:41,410
sponsor stuff was being held in customs

00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:44,500
and all of them sent her stuff to my

00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,270
home so I like collected it and all the

00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,829
things but at least I didn't I didn't

00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,840
have to drive to the customs like last

00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:52,050
year that kind of stuff we still have

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,090
300 frigate spinners sitting somewhere

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,860
because they might be against laws and

00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:01,300
regulations which have not been cleared

00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:04,030
up by by customs but whatever I couldn't

00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,390
really find a truck to rent I literally

00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:10,960
found it on Tuesday well on Monday night

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,330
no Tuesday night so on Tuesday my day

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,360
job exploded and I actually had to like

00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:19,000
on Wednesday get that truck load that

00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,099
truck shower make myself pretty argue a

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,530
lot with people who were not quite

00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:25,810
present and then rush to revenue that to

00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,399
find out that all this nicey when space

00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:33,550
which we have would not be available

00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:36,250
because like the a/c didn't work yeah it

00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,440
kind of sucks but still like we planned

00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,420
for that like we had more sponsor boost

00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,580
this time and we didn't have space for

00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,649
sponsors for all those of you who were

00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,940
like here last year also we ordered more

00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:47,500
food for breakfast cause we know I

00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,349
actually had the space to put that food

00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,319
and then like we didn't have that and

00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:55,539
all of a sudden like AC has been fixed

00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:57,069
and then secure is this yeah you can

00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:58,720
choose you can either like be like there

00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:01,750
or like there so either you have the

00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,390
green space and not those toilets like

00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:07,119
literally two toilets per gender over

00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,259
there or you can like not have the event

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,550
space and have more toilets and we're

00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:14,680
like yeah no so we fixed that with like

00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,890
gobs and gobs of money which is

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,290
amazingly a lot but whatever so other

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,410
stuff we didn't have water to flush the

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,480
toilets a few of you noticed

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,920
we had some light rain during the social

00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,920
but it was like only a little bit

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,730
food-distribution

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,890
kind of broke down this year you all

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,110
noticed and there were some issues with

00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:45,610
side security doing stuff but whatever

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:48,280

00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,400
the pronghorn organizers email address

us ASAP because as soon as we get them

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,210
we will start publishing them on the

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,000
schedule and the videos will probably

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,620
take a week or two more but again as

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,210
soon as we have them we publish them and

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,840
we'll probably tweet about it so you

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:51,690
guys can just in girls can just grab it

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,800
then please give feedback this you can

00:06:51,690 --> 00:07:00,090
actually like to take a picture of that

00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:02,340
makes sense like the first time it's

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:04,050
just like a small form which please fill

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,010
out and give feedback on all we did

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,750
because that's what we kind of depend on

00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,460
then we will have the second social

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,720
which is kind of informal it's agostina

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,050
Keller same as last year

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,850
uh no it's fine phonetic I dare say a

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,740
lot of people will just like head over

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,800
there I checked the weather it should

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:29,970
not rain like last year if you were

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:31,650
there last year it was brutal yeah yeah

00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,980
you have to paper on your own that's

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,970
correct

00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,080
like that's why it's the informal one

00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:43,550
[Laughter]

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:47,010
yeah so also because more to celebrate

00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,260
as of today open metrics actually join

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,540
us

00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,340
Ã§f at sandbox level and the embargo has

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,010
been lifted so there's probably stuff

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,680
any news about this and that's pretty

00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,990
much it please clean up around yourself

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,340
so there is staff here has less to do

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:21,160
and see you next year

00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:21,160
