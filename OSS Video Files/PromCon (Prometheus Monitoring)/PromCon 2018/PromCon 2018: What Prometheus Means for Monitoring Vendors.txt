Title: PromCon 2018: What Prometheus Means for Monitoring Vendors
Publication date: 2018-11-10
Playlist: PromCon 2018
Description: 
	Speaker: Jorge Salamero Sanz

Users have been looking for a better understanding of how Prometheus monitoring and other commercial monitoring tools compare and contrast when it comes to Docker and Kubernetes monitoring. Are they enemies? Lovers? Twins separated at birth? Let's go there. This talk will discuss the Prometheus ecosystem from a vendor perspective.

okay well thanks everyone for coming my

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,690
name is Jorge I work at the stake and

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,390
this is probably one of the most

00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:22,029
difficult talks I have ever given this

00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,910
can be very polemic and it was easy to

00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:28,390
speak a lot about cystic but I wanted to

00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:31,600
do it like more generic more about what

00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,610
should be Prometheus not for cystic

00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,980
obviously I'll talk some details about

00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,470
cystic but more for any monitoring

00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,540
vendor out there but first of all

00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:44,229
probably wish a thing well what's up

00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:46,210
money train vendor and I was thinking I

00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:49,960
was looking at the ecosystem and I could

00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:52,239
see at least three kinds of monitoring

00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,299
companies working around Prometheus

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,220
people who started or companies who

00:00:55,299 --> 00:01:00,280
started to like more traditional in

00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:03,670
monitoring companies who build databases

00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,460
and they authority are all they expanded

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:09,250
into the monitoring so things and

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,500
companies that started after Prometheus

00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:15,010
and gizzard Prometheus as their base or

00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,290
base technology I'm going to focus on

00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,300
the first one first of all because as

00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,150
they probably fits into that category

00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:26,110
but also because it's probably the most

00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:28,000
challenging sector and next we need to

00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,100
talk about what's Prometheus I'm pretty

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,770
sure everyone here knows what's

00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:36,070
Prometheus but when we talk to the

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:38,830
general audience not folks here

00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,560
Prometheus means many things it's a

00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:45,100
metric server a time series database and

00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,410
should be only that where in reality or

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,320
in practice means a few other things

00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,240
our entire monitoring stack built from

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,340
many different components so they have

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,320
different names but we understand that

00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,630
as a Prometheus as well a matrix

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,090
interface and we just saw that like

00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,580
Prometheus metrics becoming open metrics

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,350
and also wait instrument very cold the

00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:09,009
Prometheus library so there are many

00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:12,489
things that we just get together under

00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:14,530
the Prometheus name so let me talk to

00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:18,099
all these things that Prometheus means

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,430
and how can as our monitoring vendor

00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,840
approach through the different areas

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,249
when us how

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,310
monitoring Mandir when I had to provide

00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:30,769
my customers a way to implement custom

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,340
metrics I have a bunch of different

00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,650
options

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,310
I have DMX for those who were using Java

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:40,060
study recently even X bars for people

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,680
using go and with most of the companies

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,950
yesterday is to provide their own API

00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,989
and then either the company had to

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:51,680
maintain a set of libraries for

00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:53,629
different languages or the end users

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,750
have to do their own thing

00:02:53,629 --> 00:02:58,760
which was a pain in the ass but not for

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,769
the customer but also for everyone like

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,469
this over a vendor had to maintain a

00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:06,439
huge code base with very little value

00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:08,060
because it was not differentiating from

00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:13,959
any other vendor everyone had to have

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:16,159
metrics but the user had to basically

00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,230
interface with different vendors if he

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,239
was switching vendors or was using

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,919
multiple tools like imagine instrument

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,989
in a code with two different libraries

00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,239
because in your organization you have

00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:28,819
two different monitoring systems opinion

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,400
just really and while you change

00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:31,819
language then library it's not available

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,699
anymore

00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:36,439
and recently with the adoption of micro

00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:38,259
services kubernetes all this new

00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,790
technology is some all of these

00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:43,669
instrumentation or metric formats they

00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:47,150
didn't just didn't work there were some

00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:49,729
attempts to fix these problems metrics

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,530
to means here are data monitoring

00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:54,169
company came up with an extension of

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:58,449
study diversity that added some tagging

00:03:54,169 --> 00:04:02,030
but it seems the Prometheus metrics has

00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:04,549
solved this this problem ah

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,949
Prometheus metrics it's Bob Ennis we

00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:08,359
just are so on open new metric server so

00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:10,219
I'm not going to go deep there and

00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:13,430
they're even there are even other

00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:17,030
projects like implementations or ways to

00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:19,549
expand a standardization farther from

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:23,000
custom metrics into tracing and other

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:25,009
things so all these it's really really

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,900
good for our monitoring meander

00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:29,270
point of view so having a de facto

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,659
industry standard for exposing metrics

00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:35,090
it's great because we can forget about

00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:36,650
our work which is a pain in the ass and

00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,110
we see that cloud knee

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,900
the applications start to support these

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,580
metrics out of the box like tones of or

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,770
or the different component synchronizes

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,800
the exposed directly metrics easily so

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:52,160
Cuba state metrics as well different

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,919
services like East York or DNS like the

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,070
oldest developers of these projects they

00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:00,770
directly expose their internal metrics

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,509
years in one of these endpoints so for a

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:06,310
monitoring bender there is very little

00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:09,020
work today for a developer point of ear

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,490
instrument once you support many

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,440
different vendors either if you are

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,389
using a pro open source project or you

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,789
are using a commercial vendor would be

00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:18,860
great just the instrument once if you

00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:20,660
have an infrastructure monitoring tool

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,990
and then you have an API monitoring tool

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,340
and both support the same format you can

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,910
have the same metrics in two different

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:31,190
places that might be great so for me

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,900
like one of the first things I thought

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,810
about well what's what's prometheus

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,729
metrics for me is can we kill checks

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,190
exporters it scrapes like the yes

00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:43,160
message caissons and they are a pain in

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,380
the ass to maintain so that's been great

00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,229
ah thanks for the key to the community

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:51,020
for for doing that the monitoring this

00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:53,090
talk is talk like I saw a saying before

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,190
Prometheus at the Prometheus server but

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:59,740
also some components like other manager

00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:02,720
Crafar exporters push gateway and well

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,120
this is actually a feature many

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,520
organizations they are adopting

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,159
Prometheus because they can build the

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,530
monitoring system exactly as they need

00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:15,650
we were looking or we could see this

00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:18,349
yesterday where they we have like three

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,120
four different long-term storage options

00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:22,789
this is great different organizations

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,979
they have different needs and we should

00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:27,500
acknowledge that from our monitoring

00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:30,470
vendor perspective and

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,780
at Cystic we thought the first our touch

00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,330
points to start was number one the

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,190
visualization and number two the metric

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,530
collection because if this is these are

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:42,940
the parts where most of the users

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:46,820
interact with the monitoring system so

00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:49,559
we saw that Breanna was becoming a very

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,479
very popular interface and

00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:55,079
talking to our customers talking to

00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:56,579
people are evaluating says they we saw

00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:58,349
that some people they were happy with

00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:01,079
the run and didn't want to change

00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:04,259
so with all right so what we need to do

00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:05,699
is to give people the power to decide

00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,589
what cutting their face they want to use

00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,369
so if they want to use graphite now

00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:11,189
that's great

00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:13,169
let's create data source so they can get

00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:14,969
Cystic metrics over there but some of

00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:17,399
the people they said well we love your

00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:19,499
Explorer you are where you can navigate

00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,689
through your different infrastructure

00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:23,609
and we want to use that and people and

00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:25,199
within the same organization different

00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,629
people they have different opinions so

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,789
as long as they have all the information

00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:33,839
there they can use different UIs and

00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:38,029
that's fine with the metric collection

00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:40,319
it's a very similar story in under our

00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:43,229
Prometheus's talk you have the adviser

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,009
node exporter QA state metrics different

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:48,479
sources of metrics and information and

00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:52,039
assisting we have a completely different

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,709
approach and actually Cystic started

00:07:52,039 --> 00:08:00,329
doing this since they get started as a

00:07:54,709 --> 00:08:02,729
linux linux tracing or linux are yeah

00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:04,949
train system called tracing tool open it

00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:06,299
was open source and people they really

00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:10,139
liked the technology and they wanted to

00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:12,659
pay to get more value out of that so we

00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,459
we created a monitoring company out of

00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,499
that first open source praying and our

00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,869
agent is very different like it has an

00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:21,209
EVP eff system called tracing gives you

00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:23,549
fair process metrics it works really

00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,589
well really well with us shortly if

00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:27,959
roses assets continue agnostic like

00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:30,089
people use it with many other things

00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,370
that they are not just docker and the

00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:34,439
instrumentation is great but they say

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,839
well we love prometheus and we don't

00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:38,939
want to change that well that's a

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,009
reality we need to accept it but we have

00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:44,579
an awesome technology there what we can

00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:47,730
do well provide a way to those users

00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:50,069
that they want to work with Prometheus

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,589
but they love our technology to use that

00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:54,749
within their system so our agent it's

00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,610
also going to expose metrics as a

00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:59,220
Prometheus endpoint so a primitive

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,690
server can scrape all these metrics that

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:05,370
we collect in a very unique way and have

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,480
in there Prometheus server finally the

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,830
Prometheus server itself the time series

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,960
database

00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:14,140
some organizations they want to run

00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:16,420
Prometheus and they run it in very

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,950
different ways like some of the is

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,650
they're only monitoring tool in some

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,800
others they have run they have it

00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:26,800
running alongside other monitoring tools

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,020
so well if they have that need are says

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,360
take decided that we just should offer

00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,830
support for open source Prometheus it's

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,170
someone needs help with remediate will

00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:39,790
help them prepared there are other ways

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:40,900
to prove to provide help because there

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,450
are some challenges all we saw

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:47,350
scalability issues pack ins long-term

00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:49,990
storage operations and the answer to all

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:53,110
these challenges has been well first of

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,640
all offer hosted Prometheus Markin again

00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:58,450
in this talk yesterday of long-term

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,980
storage we really mention or or we saw

00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,870
that there is a bunch of different

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:05,740
companies hosted offering hosted

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:08,110
prometheus but well we took in a

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,150
slightly different approach and we have

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,710
our our embarking that has some

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,780
different features it's based on

00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,460
Cassandra but provides a scalability in

00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,280
antemer storage operation and

00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:21,640
permissions which is a highly demanded

00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:24,970
feature on on the enterprise world but

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,310
again we saw that mmm how people can

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,990
interact with our back-end that's like I

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:31,720
don't want to be completely locked in

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:35,140
into your back-end I have a bunch of

00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,890
different tools that they need to query

00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:41,740
our my metric server and we saw again

00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:44,650
that within the primitive system from QL

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:49,150
was becoming the de facto standard for

00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:52,270
querying metrics so the obvious answer

00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:55,720
has been well if that's what people want

00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:58,950
let's implement that in our interface

00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,560
between our back-end and the Prometheus

00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:06,580
ecosystem so that works actually these

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:10,000
metrics are not only years within our

00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:12,400
time series metric server but also in

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,110
other parts of your infrastructure so

00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:19,010
like the latest versions of kubernetes

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:21,890
they can they use Prometheus itself to

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:24,829
orchestrate some parts so we even have a

00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,899
custom metrics API server that talks to

00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:29,260
you this is the backend and that's

00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:31,579
something older vendors to do because

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:35,329
primitives becoming like this on their

00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:38,300
interface for any metrics out there so

00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:40,610
these are the different things we have

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:44,300
done I think that this is a good

00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:48,649
approach and well we had to summarize

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:53,600
this in a few ideas to take away first

00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:55,579
of all from traditional monitoring

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,760
vendors point of view Prometheus has

00:11:55,579 --> 00:12:00,800
been thin seen as a threat but we don't

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,560
say that way instead we think it's an

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,899
opportunity and has been really great to

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,410
the metrics a scenario sation that's

00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:11,720
good for everyone but actually we can do

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:14,690
more isn't prometheus is just nothing

00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,310
standard it's a way to do more things to

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,350
scale with the ecosystem to leverage

00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,630
existing tools and developments of the

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,310
community and approach new opportunities

00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,470
because with new software there are

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:27,079
companies people who have different

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:29,089
needs and they miny the vendor to help

00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:32,570
them not always but sometimes they do

00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:34,760
but like an open source community Orca

00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:37,699
system it's not just about taking it's a

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,380
it's also about giving so contributing

00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:40,730
back to the community it's important we

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,000
have a started to contribute to the

00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:46,220
primitive server we have three different

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,170
open source projects actually since they

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,910
get started as I said before as an open

00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,970
source project so that's very very

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:56,620
important and if we want to see this

00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:00,380
from a very very business point of view

00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:03,829
like open source users are not lost

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,480
deals we need to think as a vendor we

00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,339
need to make money so we need to think

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,589
how we can provide value to those users

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:11,750
so that's very very important for any

00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,930
vendor out there as I said we love

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:18,380
Prometheus we offer support we

00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:22,279
understood from the beginning that with

00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:24,770
the Prometheus ecosystem skyrocketing we

00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,240
need to provide a value the value to our

00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,459
customers in a way that they can

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,030
basically mix much this item how they

00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,530
want to be

00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,690
there are monitoring systems if they

00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:35,150
want to be fully open source or they

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:38,120
want to deleverage some parts into a

00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:40,580
vendor for visualization for metric

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,500
collection for Bakken and we also

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,200
understood that there is need to

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,780
contribute back wave to Prometheus but

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:52,310
also to with our visibility projects

00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:54,320
says the existing inspect Falco etc so I

00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:57,650
don't know what's my timing a have it

00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,440
wasn't too bad uh and before we move

00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:02,090
into the questions if there are any one

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,640
of the things we are - in during prom

00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:07,580
comm is to run a completely anonymous

00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,540
survey this is not a chain this is a G

00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:13,820
to get to know more and publish it

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,830
obviously about how people are under

00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:19,370
concessions are using Prometheus so we

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:22,250
have a 13 14 questions survey that you

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:25,910
can browse here or you can did in our

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:28,250
booth or also be treating the link later

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:30,410
so it would be great if you can dedicate

00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:32,990
a few a few seconds of your time to

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:35,390
complete that and that's everything

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:42,050
thank you helped you you like it enjoy

00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:45,320
thank you yep so then you have time for

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:47,740
questions first of all thank you for the

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,930
talk I really can identify with the

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:53,540
philosophy I think that's great

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:56,240
one thing I was wondering about is so

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,339
you have prom help support you are you

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,740
also thinking about like alerting

00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:02,540
support because there's already tons of

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,170
alerts out there so people could like

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:09,530
reuse those right yes I

00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:10,940
I think product team it's working on

00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:14,000
being able to configure alerts using

00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,880
bronchiole the same way ah you do

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,640
another marna here we see that many

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,670
users they still prefer to use the

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,980
graphical UI I don't know exactly the

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,600
details on how that's going to work I

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:31,160
believe both options are going to be

00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:34,130
possible maybe one more question yes so

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,440
you have a separate career Nettie's

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,970
provider for custom metrics but you have

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,240
prom cal support so what made you

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,779
implement the custom one so that can

00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,740
to the prom career so the the custom

00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:48,290
metrics API server

00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,649
it was an early implementation the

00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,660
people up the marketing team we are very

00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:56,300
excited and very fast and on writing

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,089
crazy code that don't always works very

00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,860
relatable and then the product team

00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:04,279
comes over and that's the final

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:06,649
implementation but that's basically an

00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:11,630
experiment I believe some people argue

00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:13,760
isn't it but we just wanted to have fun

00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,649
and said hey it's not possible

00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,089
permittees it's the only custom API

00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:17,660
metrics area out there that's right

00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:27,260
another one

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:29,779
so thank you anymore we have plenty of

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:34,210
time well otherwise we get a longer

00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:38,789
break thank you very much thank you

00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,789
[Applause]
