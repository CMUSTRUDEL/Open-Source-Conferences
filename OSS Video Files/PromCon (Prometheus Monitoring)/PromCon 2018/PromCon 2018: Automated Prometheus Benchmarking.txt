Automated Prometheus Benchmarking - Pushing It to Its Limits until It Breaks!

We will show you how we are trying to make Prometheus more stable by running automated benchmarking for risky PRs and before every release. In other words, let's try to break it in our tests so it doesn't break in your production.

We will cover why we decided to use Prow and how it is integrated with GitHub.

We will also cover the current progress, the project roadmap and of course do a short demo.
