00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,360
okay

00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:36,320
[Music]

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,600
sorry everybody uh we're just kind of

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,320
changing the oil as we drive down the

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,000

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,040
um let's uh let me pull up easy

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,960
questions

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,640
you guys ready to answer some questions

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,000
team yeah absolutely

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,239
all right so first question

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
i think it may be for jorge but i'm

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,280
gonna let the whole panel

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,800
get in on it after

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,320
the question it's not a question it's a

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,800
statement that's meant to be

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,840
argumentative i think in nature

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,320
this statement is webpack versus

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,320
bazel

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,680
uh basel is the tool for put

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,280
alter you can use webpack

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,360
and basically run weapon so you can use

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,960
java you can use php or words

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,720
system go over so it's not for remove

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,759
one it's for use

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,079
and use all from the mono ripples

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,960
uh the cache and all of the things so

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,400
okay not

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,479
one or the other okay so it's like uh

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,479
it makes webpack better it's not to

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,640
replace webpack

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,520
no it's not that replace okay cool all

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,360
right

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,840
uh craig why didn't you say

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,840
sven diagram i think it was a missed

00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
opportunity

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,920
whoever said that um good work i'm sorry

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,640

oh yeah um that that would be that would

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,079
be a good idea

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,080
that's um you were so close to

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,360
perfection i mean if that person

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,959

i'm too nervous all right man okay it

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,599

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,640
bruv okay anthony

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,400
yes is the is the ng debugging api only

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,680
meant for ad hoc testing or can we use

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,879
it during our unit testing as well

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,360
um so it's not bundled as part of a

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,640
prod build um but it's available on the

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,120
global window object

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,000
anytime that you're not in prod so if

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,920
you don't have

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
uh enable dev mode then it's going to

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,040
happen enable prod mode

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,400

next don't dismiss okay um craig

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,360
you passed up and aaron ma buddy it's

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,560
now the most requested question of the

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,440
conference

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,560
oh god i'm gonna give you 30 seconds to

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
figure out we're going to do another

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,479
question

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,199
you do you tune the microphone to the

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,120
guitar because

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:54,320
it's going to happen all right um

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,880
okay i think this one's for anthony

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,880
do console commands run on a separate

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,840
thread from the app renderer thread well

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,840
i don't know who is this for

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,240
yeah if you break if you're on a break

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,080
point

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,000
the execution pointer is stopped if you

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,960
execute ng update component

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,320
will it run outside the same thread as

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,320
the one holding the break point

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,600
um i would say no because i think the

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,720
break point it's blocking the major it's

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,479
possible

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,000
that it could still run change detection

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,639
but if you're blocking it with a break

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,120
point

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,240
you're walking the main renderer thread

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,919
then

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,960
i don't think anything's really going to

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,440
happen because the actual change

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,960
detection occurs in that thread

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,039
it is possible it's not something though

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,039
that i've tested it's

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,120
it's kendrick asking kendrick's really

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,080
smart so

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,400
he's just i think trying to trying to

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,560
see

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,000
how he's just pushing you how far you

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,720
can go so

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,639
i respect it all right um eric

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,400
what was the email again we want them

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,560

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,560
yes okay should be an email eric

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,919

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,960
our membership page

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,080
it's like nine bucks a month or

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,440
something that would really help with

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,800
the shipping costs we'll ship them out

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,880

take a look at and see if uh some of our

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,000
our premium offerings would make sense

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,520
um but they're pretty cool we're also

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,960

uh you know it's we wanted to give you

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,360
something maybe you could put on your

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,000
desk or your wall that would inspire you

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,520
code the future or whatever um so yeah

okay uh eric can i bring in

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,199
an existing project to stack blitz

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,639
yes you can um we actually so you can

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,720
actually import it from github

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,840
so if you go to like stackblitz.com

00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,599
github slash

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,360
your username repo name it'll actually

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,360
pull it in um

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,639
you can also drag and drop your files

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,400
from your desktop

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,680
into the stackbox editor and load them

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,000
in um

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,680
yeah we're doing a handful of work on

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,960
that actually over the next month or so

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,039
here so it's going to be

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,479
uh by the end of the year we stack blitz

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,840
and this kind of ties into the desktop

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,759
app thing um

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,039
we really want stack this to be the the

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,160
best place for you to do

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,680
your day job even um so yeah we've got a

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,960
whole bunch of stuff coming that'll make

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,919
it easy for you to

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,520
uh pull in uh you know your existing

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,400
projects and even today you can commit

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,360
back to github

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,479
off of static blitz as well i literally

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,160
thought you're gonna say no

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,520
so the fact that you had like multiple

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,160
answers to that it's kind of blowing my

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,160
mind a little bit

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,160
i i have the easy job i get to i get to

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,879
say yeah we totally do that and then you

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,280
know the other

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,800
the five uh guys at the company are you

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,919
know the ones who deserve all the praise

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,039
for who actually make it

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:58,560
happen all right um anthony

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,560
where do i find documentation on the new

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,639
debugging api

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,400
that's a very good question as of right

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,759
now from my understanding i looked for

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,160
it there is none

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,919
zero there's zero that's why i had to

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,360
look up and read the source code to

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,080
actually figure out what they did and

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,080
how they did

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,560
it um so i could figure out how to use

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,479
them um there was a single blog article

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,400
but that was that api has now been

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,400
um changed so there's been some method

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,000
name changes and a bunch of stuff

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,400
but i haven't looked honestly for any

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,080
kind of other blog articles yeah but

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,840
yeah i think there wasn't any

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,759
documentation i think as i spoke with

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,599
the angular team they mentioned that

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,159
that api is meant to change pretty

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,800
dramatically in the near future so

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,000
get like have fun with it bugger with it

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,919
and figure it out but just

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,640
know it's likely to change if you're

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,839
gonna like tool it with a

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,399
with a chrome extension or something

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,839
just be ready to um release updates

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:57,680
as the time goes on okay um

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,839
craig how you feeling you ready

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,480
yeah i got something okay all right all

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,480
right all right

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,279
all right let's see how this goes

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,880
we pop then chain up and send streams we

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,000
map

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,120
filter and subscribe we tap

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,360
we try went through tick wow

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:27,120
to bounce and we throttle time

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:31,120
don't you ever say rx isn't great

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,640
because i will find you

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:38,560
perfect api for building ui

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,279
please don't make me fine

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,279
that's all you're getting

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,720
i was waiting for i came in like

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,600
observables

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,640
it was gonna happen bro all right maybe

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,080
an ng conf next year yeah

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,640
i'll come back up soon for you i'll do

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,680
har i'll do harmony you do you do lead

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,519
let's do a course all right okay

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,079
thank you um 129 up votes on that

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,440
question

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,959
more than all the other questions we're

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
asking combined so thank you for doing

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,760
that

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,200
um eric did the lock did the rocket ever

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,440
launch

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,440
uh yes we have given the satellite to

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,600
the rocket launch provider

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,040
um it is in their hands they're doing

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
their best to get it up apparently you

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,800
have to get

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,519
uh clearance to launch stuff and uh i

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,279
guess

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,519
the government is who i don't know what

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,880
agency or whatever was really curious

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,800
what the heck

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,959
why why we're trying to launch a web

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,040
server into space

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,720
believe it or not uh but yeah so it's on

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,640
the launch for buyers manifest if you go

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,360
to deploy2.space we've got a couple of

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,600
links

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,360
um but yeah we're queued up for launch

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,720
and we're waiting for them to

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,399
to get it onto one of their rocket

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,480
launches all right

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,720
i mean what conferences in startups

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,760
launch rock is the space

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,959
stack blitz only ng conference stack

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,040
blitz there you go

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,240
that's our claim to fame here all right

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,240
um

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,600
jorge does bazel work

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:11,600
with build analyzers slash

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,880
others it's largely vague

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,720
does it work with build analyzers uh

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,160
basically bundle analyzer sorry yeah

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,519
so basil hub every hub the

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,440
remote bitly execute hub but i'm not

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:32,640
sure really i never use i never test it

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,040
or use another analyzer so i i'm not

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,640
sure

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:40,240
really okay um

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,200
eric if you i'm you kind of have to say

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,000
yes at this point

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,959
but um i think you're gonna get a lot of

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,640
fans if you do

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,959
sounds like a big ask but i'm gonna ask

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,279
it okay can we install

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,160
the john papa angular essentials code

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,760
extensions

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,959
to stack blitz uh right now you can you

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,440
can do partial so you can actually run

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,160
john

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,920
uh john papa's uh uh code snippets

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,079
starting i think like tomorrow

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,000
um maybe saturday we're we're trying not

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,200
to deploy while ng-conf is going on not

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,760
to mess with anyone's presentations but

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,839
we have

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,160
snippets ready to rock and roll uh full

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,639
vs code extension support is actually

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,480
coming in the next couple of months

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,760
maybe sooner depends on how fast we can

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,360
move some some of the

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,000
technical details but you're going to be

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,279
able to run any vs code extension

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,079
essentially

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,120
on stacklist which is going to be um and

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,160
it's going to work offline

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,480
too which is conference is over

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,320
hopefully you guys enjoyed this year

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,519
we'll see you next year at ngconf2021

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,399
2021 that's what i said good job eric

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,600
you guys are awesome

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:48,240
tell your team that's amazing okay

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,360
um someone's saying nx workspace on

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,079
stack blitz

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,040
at this point i have i don't okay talk

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,920
about it so

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,200
so the the next gen of this thing is

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,000
going to allow you to run

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,160
any uh any node program you're going to

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,120
be able to run inside stackblitz that's

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,000
coming it's been like a a year and a

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,120
half in the making

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,160
but it's we've got it working which is

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,720
pretty pretty nuts

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,079
um so we'll in a couple of months we'll

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,519
have some more info on that but yeah you

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,320
can run annex

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,000
you can run your own custom tooling uh

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,200
anything that you do locally you will be

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,880
able to do inside of stack blitz

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:30,160
okay uh another i'm gonna give you

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:34,639
an another sales pitch

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:37,600
uh it says uh

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,720
the differences between stack blitz and

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,920
other vs code like cloud ids

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,560
this is just a chance for you to market

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,320
yeah yeah gorilla markets um i mean

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,480
basically the difference so like

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,199
uh in a nutshell right stack blitz is

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,680
um is great for the same reasons that

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,279
today

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,160
everyone here uh uh uses their local ide

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,639
to develop code

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,240
right and why because it's really fast

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,760
you don't have to pay for like a vm in

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,079
the cloud or something you already have

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,279
this

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,120
great machine in front of you so you're

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,959
just using it there it works offline it

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,600
ties to your local file system et cetera

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,720
right

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,320
uh stack which is the only ide uh that's

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,760
online that actually we don't use

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,040
servers like when you go to stackblitz

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,120
and start working on a project

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,279
you're not using a vm that's actually

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,760
using your cpu your memory

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,120
and doing all of that compute inside of

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,320
your browser itself

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,680
right so that's why if you kill your

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,279
internet connection stack blitz will

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,040
keep working like that uh

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,800
that what's on this t-shirt we made this

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,160
on a plane without internet

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,519
right and uh that's great because that

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,199
means we can give stack boots out for

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,199
free we don't have to charge for you to

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,639
have the vm and usually the vms in the

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,560
cloud are like you know smaller than

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,120
your own computer there's latency

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,040
it's not a great experience um and so

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,000
stacklets gives you all the benefits of

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,480
of what makes local development great

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,639
but

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,079
openable in a link and so that's that's

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,480
the the key difference between

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,880
stack blitz and all the other players in

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,880
the market

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,320
my bad my mic was off are there any

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,120
on-prem requirements for running stack

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,959
blitz enterprise

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,839
um it depends on i'd be curious to i'd

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,240
can we query for more information on on

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,480
requirements

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,000
or i i can answer generally i think i

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,000
think uh generally speaking

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,040
um i think the answer is no uh i unlike

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,199
you just basically need to have if you

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,079
have like an internal npm registry

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,240
um that's really the only thing that

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,360
stacklets would need to talk to

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,920
we can integrate with any uh sso

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,120
uh stuff that you've got uh on-prem um

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,639
and the thing can we can also

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,480
a lot of the companies that are using it

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,440
now are actually running stack within a

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,279
vpc

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,560
it's a lot easier to get that set up and

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,680
there's kind of less

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,399
uh less hassle with your itsec folks

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,959
um but it's actually quite uh quite

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,519
simple

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,920
to to get up and running it's very very

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,560
isolated and isn't touching a lot of the

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,519
the

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,680
uh data that is you know is uh would

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,519
require a lot more auditability and that

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,959
sort of thing we have a lot of audit

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,320
logs built into it but you know things

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,839
like your source control or customer

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,639
data we don't touch that stuff

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,920
at all so it's from an i.t perspective

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,160
it's it's pretty great

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,160
okay cool craig

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,560
uh why do you still keep the assertion

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,639
guard in place

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,480
once the input has a type won't

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,399
something be guaranteed to be feasible

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,079
at compile time

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,600
it will be if the person who's using

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,279
your library is using typescript

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,560
but sometimes people use our libraries

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,480
and they're only using javascript so

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,959
there's not really a problem to keep

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,000
those

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:53,680
runtime checks in there as well

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,880
brilliant brilliant

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,880
great job okay are we good on time we

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,920
got one one more

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,120
okay we got okay um someone asking why i

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,240
didn't shave my head

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,679
because i don't shave my head uh

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:13,919
simple uh to to

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,480
to tony does this api that the debugging

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,160
api

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:22,720
does it work in firefox edge and safari

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:26,559
yes okay yes perfect

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,440
craig uh

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,840
who is your favorite cricket player is

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
my

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,039
favorite crooked player um yeah yeah

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:39,120
okay hold on there's two options

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:41,919
kane williamson or virat kohli

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,320
kane absolutely came kane williamson all

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,720
right

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,679
great i think most of us were thinking

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,600
kane

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,880
yeah i think he's the obvious choice

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,200
yeah i mean

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,799
obviously for obvious reasons based on

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,320
like stats

00:17:52,799 --> 00:18:01,120
he shoots he shoots the ball better

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:04,320
yeah he does uh jorge

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,960
question is

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,880
disappeared is bazel like an interface

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,440
between two things frameworks that don't

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,080
speak the same lingo

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,720
no not really baseless for the builders

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,000
on the test

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,960
it's a monorepo system so you can build

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,320
all your projects in your monorepo it's

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,360
it's this thing

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,720
uh put in in a nation engine

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,080
so the thing is you will create your

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,160
project

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,600
all your projects and you can use bazel

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,320
for build

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,120
have some system for public and prevent

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,000
things

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,120
so you can in example angular when

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,039
create a new version

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,480
publish in your internal place this

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,640
place slash base build

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,720
and all the dependencies have this

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,760
folder this bazel build

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,280
start to test so it's it's for this

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,760
it's it's for build and test uh your

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,760
projects

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:13,120
all right okay

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,200
um okay this is i guess i'm gonna throw

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,559
this up there for everybody

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:24,400
i think it's directed at craig how are

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:28,559
types different than classes

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:31,919
i mean yeah i can start with that um so

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,520
types only exist at compile time so

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,039
talking about if you have like type

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,840
thing equals thing only it's a sick

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,160
compile time

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,320
whereas the class will actually be code

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,120
that is shipped to your application

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,240
um you can use a class as a type um you

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,400
can say

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,080
you know assign something to being like

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,160
a type of an array

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,080
that's using a class as a type really

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,520
but types that you do more things so

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,360
types let you do like

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,799
black generics and conditionals and all

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,960
those things they talked about um

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:04,720
so they're similar but different gotcha

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:08,240
okay if the script

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,159
is based off elsa's magic then why can't

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,159
she just start olaf instead of waiting

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,159
for the script to be finished

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,400
because that would be a very good story

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,320
would it it's a plot hole

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,240
it's a plot hole yeah it's a plot hulk

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,000
i'm happy to admit it and besides it's

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,559
about you know kristoff learning a good

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,760
lesson

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,720
about um you know taking care to write

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,400
good types yeah

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,000
i also can't just also can't just always

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,240
save the day we can't just be dependent

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,320
on

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,960
yeah on one person your versions are

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,159
coming of age of kristoff

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,600
yeah okay i saw that i felt that

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,200
thank you yeah that was that was the

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,520
blow i think maybe they missed it i

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,000
think

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,159
i think that the question asker missed

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,200
the profound messaging

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,880
behind the new story that

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,559
disney year talks already right you're

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,760
in talks

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:00,960
are you coming out um april 2021

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:04,080
it's gonna be part of the ride cool um

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,000
all right eric how did

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,840
okay the websites haven't been deployed

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,720
to space so don't ask

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,720
uh craig say again your twitter handle

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,559
um it's phenomenal

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,520
got it that's craig and on github you're

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,120
phenom nom nominal

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,200
yeah three numbers you know too many

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,919
numbers on twitter i got you i got you i

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,240
got you

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:44,799
um craig they want the soundtrack

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:47,760
uh no no no they want craig's songs

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,520
oh you're did you sound clouded yet no

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,400
i'll i'll check one up somewhere at some

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,880
point all right

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:57,360
um it would be cool to um

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,280
if you could we will release him as uh

00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,760
i'm part on the podcast if you want us

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,520
to

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,200
if you get him we'll we'll put a part of

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,919

all right no other votes on the other

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,880
questions anthony it's not possible to

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,280
debug this stuff in prod mode right like

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,200
it has to be in debug only

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,960
yeah so the actual if you look at the

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,760
source code inside of angular

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,280
that creates this api there is very

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,840
strict it is not

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,840
not to be allowed in prod

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:37,120
okay cool thanks uh anthony

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:40,880
um i think the questions are basically

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,880
done last question the four of you would

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,440
you be willing to post your to tweet out
