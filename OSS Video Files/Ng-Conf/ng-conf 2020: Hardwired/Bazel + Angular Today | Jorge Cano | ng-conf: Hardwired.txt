00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,280
about this

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,280
and my first thing is

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,480
it's time to toss a coin

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,480
to your builder it's

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,560
time to basil the next pillar for the

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,000
angular cli

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,920
it's basil okay we need i have

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,120
a good question for all we need think we

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,200
need to think on this

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,159
yeah think in

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,000
four five problems you have in in your

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,040
apps in your ecosystem apps yeah you

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,400
have your angular app

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,440
the backend and apis so

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,480
the bills the all tests thinking you

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,560
know

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:58,799
so the question is it's bazel

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,080
solved any of these problems issues

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,040
so now don't respond wait

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,000
you can respond only with maybe maybe

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,599
not

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,360
yes or no no directly

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,720
yeah so remember

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,560
because maybe after this talk

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:24,320
you can say hey maybe

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:28,080
maybe yes or yes so

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:32,000
we will talk about bazel yeah but

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,639

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,320
basel or or you know what is spaces what

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,560

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,759
if you don't put your hand up i can see

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,600
the chat really

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,320

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,960

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,600
or

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,800
who is the power about the xl so

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,520
i will give a cool example yeah thinking

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,880
in movies

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,440
yeah i'm i'm big fan of some books

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,440
and these books move to movies uh i'm

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,199
big fan from tolkien

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,960
so we're thinking the lore of the rings

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:14,160
yeah the main character

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,199
was frodo yeah the the unique man

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,840
can get the ruin and hey it's not a

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,400
spoiler

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,280
the book is really old and the movie too

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,400
come on

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,320
uh so it's not a spoiler sorry but you

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,680
need think in another characters

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,960
yeah the community of the ring and all

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,160
uh work together but

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,800
if you think frodo is angular

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,800
you need think some it's basil

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,479
so frodo what's the important one you

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,600
know it's

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,639
the man the man have the ring but

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,080
some it's the other man

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,880
push to frodo for

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,680
for finish the movie really uh in the

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,199
bad moments

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,240
some work with frodo

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,440
and pass all the tests so

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,720
some be more efficient and

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,960
more faster to frodo

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:18,720
imagine it's like nine hours of movies

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,800
without sun is like maybe 25

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,840
or something like that but okay if you

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,000
don't see

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,440
if you don't see the movies if you never

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,800
saw any movie

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,440
uh it's it's good time to see but if not

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,960
okay

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:36,960
uh we we can think in another

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,960
do you remember the tnx developers

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,800

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,240
yeah

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,360
but but

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,720
the the next building tests

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,800
exist and that is bazel bazel

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:58,160
is the real the next

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,840
time bill interest okay

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,960
so now you know all the important

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:08,880
of ways so it's time to

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:12,080
talk about the updates bazel 1.0

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,880
the first really really good thing is

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,000
work in all operating system that is

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,720
magic

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,919
because i have windows and doesn't work

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,199

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,960
days

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,720
bazel 1.0 it's working on all operative

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000

windows mac linux and chrome ox

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,840
really chrome os is like hey it's

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,440
a container for linux packwork yeah and

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,639
the other thing

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:49,039
it's publish the

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,680
rpe remote building execute

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,960
this is one magic i will talk some

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,000
slides

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,680
next but okay a lot of things

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,039
in latin america i'm really excited

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,160
about that because

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,720
uh it's the first it's the in qigong

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,520
with

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,919
most people from latin america so i'm

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,280
from latin america so i'm really excited

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,360
uh but a lot of people in latin america

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,840
ask me this question

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:21,199
hey cool use angular

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,599
yes we know and start to say hey google

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,720
use

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:28,479
bazel bazel is in google

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,879
and i say no no

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,680
they think it's blaze blaze it's the

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,800
main

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,599
of all of this and bazel is a fork

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,880
and the the same team from bazel is the

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,560
team from place

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,440
so this team work in both platforms

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,839
and start to move to one but they think

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,800
it's

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,240
uh blaze have a lot of rules and things

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,440
from google

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,760
and are for the business so and for this

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,880
is

00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,000
it's blaze here and base

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,760
so think in this

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,040
you need to see this image yeah this

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,680
image is

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,240
one of the most important image now

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,040
youtube

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,920
google maps estedia i don't have a

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,600
stadia because

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,800
it's only for for europe and u.s but

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,399
stadia and tensorflow they talk from

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,839
around

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:25,120
angular and all of this really

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,720
scale fast into google

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:33,040
thanks to place of bazel yesterday

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:36,320
schulz say hey we have 2000

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,160
or plus no we have really a lot of

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,440
project

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,560
from google with angular no and

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,279
the first thing is i say is okay

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,240
that's it's magic with bazel or blaze

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,440
it's the same

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,320
because you build one time

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,480
and test in others so this is one of the

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,600
magic of the monoripos but the

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:03,040
basal or blaze work really really fun

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,560
uh fine with this so

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,760
okay i talk about remote building

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,000
execute rbe it's a service to

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,720
distribution the execution

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,519
of bills and test actions across

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,880
multiple

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:22,160
workers yeah so uh they

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,440
make uh build fast yeah like

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,440
more efficient and repulsive uh this is

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,160
one of the thing

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,120
but this is scale your build

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,360
capabilities

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,600
yeah and you don't need the build farm

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,360
so imagine

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,160
you have a netbook or a little notebook

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,440
your all on mac this mac with the good

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,079
keyword

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:51,920
and say hey i can build all

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,519
in the monorepo rpe built for you it's a

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,959
remote building execute

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,040
so you don't need thinking buy

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,519
a lot of computers or more faster

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,880
computers you don't need a farm from

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:08,880
for only build and test your application

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,440
the other thing it's tnx tnx faster

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,320
it's not the next developer it's tin x

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,079
faster

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:20,399
ci and test build imagine

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:23,519
in scoli the ci it's like

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,920
four to six minutes for run yeah

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,640
one run from the ci is four to six

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,880
minutes

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,240
it's not really big scully but it's

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,079
called in my machine or

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,440
in the sander machine or in the arrow

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,440
machine we have

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,959
news machines it's like 40 seconds

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:44,079
and when test we have one a branch

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,480
for bazel and we test this it's like

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,120
some seconds you know it's like boom go

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,480
down

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,440
so uh the the thing of this is

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,639
imagine the ci it's only take 10 seconds

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,920
i'm really okay

00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,720
or imagine your build times yeah

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,079
your 30 minutes building time you can

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,200
move to some minutes

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:08,160
so you can move faster really

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,079
the other thing it's uh the the remote

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,639
building execute is an api

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,279
and google create with industry

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,040
standards

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:20,240
so it's really good and easy to use

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,480
and the other thing it's google think in

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,720
rbe or the team of remote building

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,680
execute and place think in this

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,839
uh working for google and for your

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,959
partners testing with the partners and

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,959
all the ecosystem

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:38,240
so it's really prepared for okay but

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,440
what include rb yeah the remote building

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,560
execute

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,440
uh the first it's a distribution

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,240
worker pull for parallel executions uh

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,959
you can build

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,079
and test actions in parallel that's for

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,360
me it's really good

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,279
the other good thing is the remote cache

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,440
the remote cache for sharing

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,639
intermediate and final builds uploads

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,839
its

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:05,040
magic have support in linux for

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,920
build concurrency and

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,600
the concurrency for the gpu for windows

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,760
is on the roadmap i think it's in the

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,360
q4 i'm not sure for this year but for

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,560
the end of the year

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,079
and have storage and visualization of

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,920
all build and test results so

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,959
it's like another magic api

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,240
but we are in the engine conf and we are

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:36,560
in at the end

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:39,680
we write javascript yeah we are here

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,560
and bazel love javascript and with

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,560
blazer1

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,360
we have the full support

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,399
for javascript

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,360
that's yeah in this moment when i think

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,199
this talk

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,199
at this moment i waiting some people to

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:01,680
stand up and clapping you know it's like

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:05,440
oh yes finally but the real thing

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:09,040
it's this give it for you

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,720
so based on javascript yeah

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:16,000
but what this mean

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,199
for the angular developers okay so it's

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,399
bazel can't run javascript

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:26,560
or any javascript ecosystem tooling

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:30,160
that's mean we can use angular here

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,000
so think on this we have an energy

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,279
command yeah then she commands

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,079
read the angularjson and find the

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,199
builder

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:42,639
yeah the builder internally it's called

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,199
architecture architect yeah so in this

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,480
case

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,639
uh we normally use webpack so

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,600
it's like this yeah we have the

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,720
architect

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,480
build builder angular repeat build

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,959
this is the build for default so

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,160
the thing is uh we can change this

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,279
builder

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,880
for the builder for basin yeah

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:10,720
so at the end bazel loves

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:13,600
angular because now we can put

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,040
some parts together and we can run

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,160
arbitrary

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:22,560
initiates too so

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:25,760
now we can use the cli

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:29,199
with bazel with any trick

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,240
or things like that but i will say that

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,920
okay wait this is a deprecate image

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,680
i will see that if you need to

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,399
understand more about wheelers and all

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,440
of this

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,560
please rewatch the talk from mike mike

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,480
it's amazing yesterday okay i

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,320
understand more of the builders so you

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,839
can see the talk from mike

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,000
and if you say hey jorge okay uh bazel

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,160
have a lot of configuration for initials

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,399
and all of this basically have ncla

00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,800
but you have another option yeah uh

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,959
narwhals create this amazing this

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,079
amazing

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,720
it's it's i it's like a tool yeah this

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,839
it's amazing

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,480
i don't have a name for this it's

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,920
amazing nx it's amazing

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,800
uh so if you think

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,320
in to test this fast maybe the more

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,360
faster thing to test

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,399
it's nx it's like

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,440
basil in a lot of things but it's

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,959
amazing so

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:32,560
a big cube to my my friends from nx

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:36,320
but if you have any scully problem today

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:39,440
do you remember we can stop a second

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,560
but remember i

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:46,560
ask hey basic result

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,680
some problem you have some issue in your

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,079
and you say maybe maybe not but if you

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,040
have

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,839
some scully problem with basil the

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,639
problem is off

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,000
because the ecosystem of angular it's

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,519
prepared for pillars

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,559
and and use webpack so you can use basil

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,199
and finish all the things

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,400
for this you can build your libraries

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,360
like show

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,480
manfred you can you can work with all

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,079
with bazel it's

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,839
really similar to working like the next

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,640
does okay i will say big thanks to my

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,360
friend alex

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,919
uh alex help me alex show me the first

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,039
time

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,280
basil i'm really excited about us like

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,280
in the last two years and for this

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,840
create the book and all of this so

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,760
and he helped me a lot and helped a lot

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,520
to work basil with angular cla

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:44,400
and help me so big thanks to faisal

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:48,880
but here we will go here we go again

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:52,720
you know it's like angular this

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,400
all are asking hey which is the roadmap

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,799
for angular 10

00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:03,280
hey which the roadmap for angular

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:07,039
19. you know and here we go again

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,240
some days ago we are

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:14,000
we are moving to

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:16,160
basil 1.5 yeah now typescript

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
have the tsc compiler is not the

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,679
developer of this

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,120
and in the text say we are starting

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:29,200
work on a two dot

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:32,559
x branch so

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,840
we have a new advertion friends we will

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,360
continue

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,280
to bazel.2.0 yeah

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:45,520
so i think maybe the next year

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,520
we will talk about basil just 0 in the

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,520
next enchi conf so

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:57,120
we need weights that's all thank you

00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:11,840
and i really love this and

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:11,840
