have good news and bad news the bad news

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:46,020
is our dear friend entry components is

00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,469
out of here for those of you who don't

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,660
know

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,789
enter components first appeared back on

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:54,059
the scene of the angular and Burton the

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,879
raw version to what its main job was to

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,859
help us tell angular which components we

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:04,159
needed create it and insert it into our

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:06,409
angular application at runtime on second

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,360
there's more

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:12,150
captain babyface what is the good news I

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:17,640
forgot oh goodness the same as a bad

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:22,830
news okay okay guys we have good news

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,960
Android components is out of here if you

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,509
were one of the ones who had to do with

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,479
pop ups and your angle application but

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,619
instead ended up wiling your own defeat

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,890
as you came up with this error here I'm

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,509
pretty sure you can appreciate now what

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,369
angular has to offer with the new

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,600
angular be with not having to deal with

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:49,570
angular components so

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,970
angular the angular core team heard your

00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,860
cries guys they heard your cries they

00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:57,040
heard your tweets the hares our blogs

00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:00,840
and your github issues and they decided

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:06,430
to give the entry components duh boot

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,260
now what exactly did happen that changed

00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,650
and metric opponents obsolete

00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:13,780
well we here at ng-conf news decided to

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,240
go and get the inside scoop and go

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,990
directly to the angular core team to

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,190
find out exactly what happens so let's

00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,980
go behind the scenes and get a

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:28,450
behind-the-scenes look okay

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:30,820
so prior to angular 9 angular generated

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,580
ng factories for all components declared

00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,340
in the template ng factories were as

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,620
that were actually what was used behind

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,990
the scenes doing angular run time

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,730
instead of angular components which if

00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,830
we didn't know about it was what caused

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,890
a lot of the confusion so this was done

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,959
in conjunction with component the

00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,290
component factory resolver to enable

00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:57,610
things like tree shaking now because of

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:59,590
these factors angler could no longer but

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,959
could not use dynamic components at

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,440
runtime because they didn't have any ng

00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:08,200
factories there for the entry components

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,450
array was used to inform angler about

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,920
these come these dynamic components so

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,560
that their factories would be available

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,150
to angular at runtime so that you can

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:23,500
now use things like pop-ups now now as

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:27,040
of angular 9 there are no more indie

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,260
factories they're out of here all the

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,810
information needed to render components

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,480
are attached to static properties called

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,400
comp in fact respectively so that

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,650
angular will know exactly how to render

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,540
these components and you don't need

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,810
enter components in you are so in the

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,610
words of our dear friend Alex from the

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,800
angular core team who actually worked on

00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,260
the compiler the reference to the

00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,420
component now is indeed a reference to

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,360
this Factory

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:58,490
so to wrap this all up and bring it

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,700
around if your components are

00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:08,700
angler IV is awesome components are

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:11,190
smarter than you Jesus and and if you

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,260
haven't done so already upgrade your

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,560
angular application to angular 9 so you

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,600
can join in the fun with us and now I

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,480
would like to give a special thanks to

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,360

scoop that we would not have had had it

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,780
not been for them and for ng-conf or

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:36,060
