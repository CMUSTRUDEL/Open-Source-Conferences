um i was too busy watching aaron's talk

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,840
i'm not ready for the questions give me

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,960
one second

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,160
questions ready

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,239
all right i don't know if these are the

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,000
latest not a lot of not a lot of

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,320
questions with votes on this

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,680
people if you have questions for these

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,760
guys

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,800
ask them given the sheer amount of

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,399
comments i saw

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,440
on um aaron's talk

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,120
i know there should be a lot of

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,399
questions so i'm going to refresh my

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,160
stream here real quick

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,559
so give me one second let's go back full

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,559
screen

00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,600
on that no not a lot of questions over

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,960
here

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,119
i don't know why okay

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,280
james this one's for you the first one's

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,280
for you bro

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,520
how do you use interceptors with angular

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,560
fire i tried a couple times

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,840
but it doesn't fire angular interceptors

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,320
yeah um so interceptors aren't

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,960
going to work unfortunately um for for

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,759
most

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,680
of angular fire um because those are

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,159
going to be going over

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,079
a socket connection right it's not going

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,320
to be a traditional http

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,000
um that's how we get the those real-time

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,479
natures there's going to be a socket

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,439
and you know even if you did intercept

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,759
them

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,720
what's going over the sockets as raw

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,159
protobufs

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,200
so not a lot of use there um

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,399
but you know if people have you know

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,439
thoughts on how to make the

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
angular library more testable please let

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,240
me know

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
just get in touch one of the things that

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,920
has made it a lot better is now we

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,439
actually have emulator support

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,759
coming from firestore in the realtime

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,600
database which should make

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,119
close those loops a little bit for

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,720
testing in particular

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,319
uh if you want to see a good example

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,599
that actually look at the angular fire

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,319
tests

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,440
almost all of them are now using the

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,440
firebase emulators

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,879
thanks for the question

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,319
we're having a some technical technical

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,760
things going on on our end sorry

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,840
all right brandon yep question for you

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,840
brandon

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,840
any plans to add support for route

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,840
aliases

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,879
it says adding a name to the route so i

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,040
don't have to hard code my paths in my

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,040
app

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,319
um no not at the moment

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,040
even when we uh redesigned the angular

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,760
router

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,599
uh the path or name analysis came up

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,080
there and it was

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:05,040
more flexible to build

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,640
urls based on the past segments there so

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,159
it was a discussion that we had back and

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,400
forth and i think it's

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,560
proven itself out uh to work better

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,480
that way so i wouldn't foresee there

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,120
being name aliases there out of the out

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,440
of the box anyway

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,599
angularjs developers man we're missing

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,720
the path aliasing

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,680
admit it all right hey ron

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,239
you ready for a question yep all right

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,000
what are the upcoming pre-built machine

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,879
learning models in tensorflow

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,879
what are the upcoming pre-built models

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,799
in tensorflow yeah like what are

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,599
what's any anything cool coming on the

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,440
pipelines that people can know about

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,280
i'm not exactly sure um what they're

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,879
planning to build right now because um

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,200
they don't publicly release what they're

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,159
um

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,200
building right now okay they don't talk

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,959
a lot ahead of time

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,720
they just kind of yeah let you know when

00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,920
it's out once they sit like they talk a

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,280
lot about it but

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,360
if they haven't like released it yet

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,400
they don't say anything about it

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,840
classic google they do the same thing

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,000
with angular we get you man

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,120
classic fires keeping it close to the

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,480
best that's all

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:18,239
yeah all right thanks aaron uh aaron

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,440
another question a lot of people

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,040
actually are voted this up

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,400
this might be the top voted question of

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,759
the conference this far just so you know

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,840
aaron

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,840
okay what is a typical day like for you

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,240
what is a typical day like for me people

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,320
a lot of people like

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,199
us are baffled by you

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,960
intellectually and socially we want to

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,280
know what is your day like what is a day

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,840
like for aaron ma

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,720
okay um so a typical school day um

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,800
normally like

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,080
around like 7 30 or something i just

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,199
wake up

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,560
and then from 8 30 8 to 3 o'clock i'll

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,639
be at school and then around um 3 20

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,639
i'll arrive at home

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,240
and that's when um i start doing my

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,240
homework once i'm done with my homework

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,400
i just basically um

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,720
do my computer science stuff it's

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,280
basically my day in short

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,919
so do you teach the class at school or

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,320
are you like taking the class

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,840
uh i can't teach at school okay so i'm

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,639
taking the classes so you're part of the

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,400
class

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,000
yeah part of class okay cool i'm not

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,479
learning anything people were gonna

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,560
ask so i had to ask and then your

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,960
computer science stuff

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,400
is that self-assigned or is data signing

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,600
not that mom is sending that to you or

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,199
how are you getting these computer

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,919
science assignments

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,520
self-assigned yeah i just because i just

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,680
love computers

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,000
yeah so i remember when i when we did a

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,919
podcast me and you

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,600
you kind of said sometimes dad slows you

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,000
down so you just like dad leave me alone

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,080
i got this

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,360
is that how it is yes sometimes

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,080
your dad's such a nice guy okay uh 69 oh

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,440
yeah

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,199
easily any three questions don't have as

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,080
many votes on that just so you know

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,840
how do you manage to learn so many

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,440
things

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,199
that's the next question that's for you

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,440
aaron

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,720
okay um so i think the real reason why i

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,479
learned so many things was because i

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,160
think i started early because when i was

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,479
five that's when i actually started to

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,440
like

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,919
love computers like every day once i get

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,880
home i

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,280
like um do computer science stuff and

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,639
just

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,440
keep learning learning learning yeah no

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,039
no i mean

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,639
when five-year-olds when all of us

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,440
started programming at five that's kind

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,039
of how it was for

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,080
the rest of us too so that makes sense

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,080
um all right so the next question is for

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,759
aaron as well

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,599
i think we got some more for for you

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,599
gentlemen lore but i'm gonna keep going

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,960
on these errand ones okay

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,360
hey ron in ml what's the difference

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,919
between

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,520
accuracy and loss are they just

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,599
opposites or do they actually measure

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,479
different concepts

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,520
so accuracy is actually a completely

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,880
different thing than

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,479
loss so accuracy is basically the total

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,360
number of predictions that your model

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,280
got right

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,919
divided by all the predictions

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,919
and um loss is basically measuring the

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,080
error of your model

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,479
that's what locks so basically um exact

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,319
opposite thing

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,520
so accuracy is measuring the correct of

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,840
your model and

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,039
loss is the air of your model in short

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,960
so it but

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:38,080
to your point not erroring is not the

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,080
same as being accurate

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,599
right yeah maybe i don't know

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,280
they use the double error double

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,599
negative it's confusing i apologize all

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,759
right

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,960
i believe the question was um what

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,000
things should we consider

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,520
when using routes in angular and why

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,720
would someone use

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,440
angular router versus uh the router that

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,440
i proposed today yeah yeah yeah

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,360
so yeah the things you could should

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,560
consider when using routes and angular

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,080
is um i would say stick to using guards

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,360
versus resolvers

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,599
for using guards uh if you're using ngrx

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,720
i would say use guards exclusively and

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,720
push data into the store

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,360
store some information store minimal

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,120
amount of information with your route

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,560
data

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,479
try to use your

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,160
uh use the streams that are available

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,279
from the angular router now

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,080
to kind of map into

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,080
data streams

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,839
now streams in the okay cool

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,800
the data streams in your uh components

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,240
so and if well why would you use the

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,839
angular router or use

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,360
this router that i proposed today versus

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,480
the angular router

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,720
is that i think that

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,880
community projects have been built very

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,920
successfully around angular the core of

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,279
angular

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,440
and i'd like to see more of those

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,240
projects and to see of course help the

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,360
community

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,320
expand and these projects to help push

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,320
innovation and

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,480
collaboration within the community as

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:22,080
well as with

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:24,640
upstream angular so

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
james you hear me yes i do all right

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,480
cool

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,399
so we got a question um do you need to

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,080
deploy your app to firebase to take

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,200
advantage of the new google analytics

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,120
plugin

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,760
and can you use firebase just for

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,880
specific features like ga

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,200
yeah absolutely so um

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,000
everything's modular right uh really

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,200
we're releasing a lot of tools around

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,440
google cloud and the services there but

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,920
those aren't necessary right if you just

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,560
want to use the google analytics pieces

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,080
go right ahead pull that in just use

00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,959
those if you just want to use remote

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,440
config

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,360
go for it if you just want to deploy a

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,240
quick little angular app on firebase

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,079
hosting

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,240
you can do so you don't have to use any

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,640
of the other services

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,839
really it's it's the idea is that we're

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,200
trying to build tools

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,399
to help you um and i don't have a strong

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,560
opinion

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,320
whether or not that means that you're

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,760
hosted on google cloud or using our

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,440
databases right

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,680
it's that if you're using pieces of

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,160
google technology i want to build things

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,079
to help make that more seamless and

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,360
angular

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,600
gotcha cool okay going back to the top

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,640
over here

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,320
oh yeah aaron aaron ma

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,880
hey aaron what's the hardest thing about

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,959
getting started with tensorflow

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,600
what's the hardest thing about getting

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,040
started with tensorflow yup

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,480
the hardest thing i would say

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,959
um the hardest thing for me is actually

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,959
just like

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,240
installing tensorflow because when

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,839
you're trying to insult yourself

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,360
there's like a million problems that can

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,200
come up

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,480
for example that when i first tried

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,920
installing tensorflow like

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,920
my computer wouldn't even recognize what

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,360
exactly is tensorflow so i just

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,120
keep getting these like errors or

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,760
something and eventually i figured out

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,600
how to fix them

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,760
um so i think i remember you telling me

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,880
the other hard thing for you was that

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,240
since you're a kid

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,920
you didn't really get all the access to

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,720
all the same apis and everything and so

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,959
you had to go

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,200
yes that's another thing tell me about

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,200
that

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,240
so um that's actually um free um udacity

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,279
so like um

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,640
last year yes last year um

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,440
for christmas uh my i want to like to

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,600
enroll into

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,959
udacity celebrating our engineering

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,320
program

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,399
and my dad said yes so i enrolled in it

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,399
it's like two days after i enrolled i

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,120
got an official email from udacity and

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,600
said

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,560
we have cancelled your subscription to

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,279
udacity social

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,720
engineering program because you are

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,519
under 13 years old

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,160
so like kind of angry but eventually

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,000
yeah

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,360
you wanted you wanted to do self-driving

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,360
car stuff

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,200
yeah and then eventually um i got into

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,079
contact with um udacity's ceo and

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,240
eventually um

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,320
he was pretty nice and he said yeah okay

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,800

through

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,920
like one does so that's how i eventually

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,440
um graduate from the skull stream

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,000

happen

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,279
did you did your assistant call

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,279

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,959
aaron can you hear me uh can you repeat

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,040
please

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,120
yeah did your assistant call sebastian

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,519
or did you call him

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,399
uh i um i didn't call him i actually uh

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,079
emailed him

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,600
guys i was like googling i figure out

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,800
his email address on google

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,399
gotcha okay cool there's some questions

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,120
in the chat so i had to clear that up

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,639
good

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:07,120
okay um are there any plans to integrate

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:09,040
pwa nw come on

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,440
uh and firebase service worker are there

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,160
any plans to integrate the angular pwa

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,720
and the firebase service worker yeah

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,839
actually

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,880
so uh i didn't didn't make the cut for

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,120
6.0

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,720
but the community has found a couple

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,959
good work arounds

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,200
um for integrating those and one of the

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,560
things that i'm planning on bringing in

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,480
and probably 6.1 once i you know address

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,040
all the 6.0 issues and

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,639
add some new stuff um it'll be tighter

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,000
integration between the two

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,320
um uh jeff delaney did some great videos

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,240
there

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,560
on angular firebase or fireship io now

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,160
um where he worked through some of those

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,920
problems and

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,360
you know the word from the community is

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,000
that those work arounds are working

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,680
pretty well

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,920
so we'll probably just build them into

00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:02,800
the library

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:06,959
okay um

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,040
two questions left there well three

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,279
they're all the last two are the most

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,399
serious um

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,000
is ngrx-router a new component or was

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,720
that some sort of pseudo code that you

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,839
were throwing down on your sites

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,920
uh it's an actual component and

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,199
yeah the injects router is a component

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,839
the injectors route

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,600
is a component and you can see those

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,600
there's actual working code in the

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,440
github repo that i shared during the

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,040
talk okay i didn't figure i'd have

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,959
enough time to do the

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,680
demo but yeah you can definitely dive in

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,720
and see all the components there

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,839
okay what's up here at the github repo

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,880
okay so second last question will the

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,800
three of you

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,959

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,560
definitely okay what you're doing my

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,560

roberts brandon t roberts okay cool

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,160
uh last question it's the top of the

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,920
list i have to answer aaron

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:27,839
consider it seriously before you give it

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,839
is aaron ma going to conquer the world

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,560
um i don't know

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,920
i never know there's only one answer

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,079
when you get asked that the answer is

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,639
always yes

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,440
yes you never know because life is an

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,320
endless curve

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,320
waiting for it to happen so life's an

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,600
endless curveball

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,680
deep thoughts but never know what's

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,480
gonna happen all right

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,759
that's the right answer at any time okay

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,440
yeah we've all gotten a lot of

00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,399
curveballs the past couple weeks

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,920
yeah okay definitely all right gentlemen

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,480
appreciate your talk i'll be surprised

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,639
though
