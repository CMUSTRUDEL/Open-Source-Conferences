[Music]

00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,980
[Applause]

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,920
[Music]

00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:16,240
[Applause]

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:18,880
[Music]

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,560
let's bring our q a onto the stage

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,080
everybody how you doing you good

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,439
you're doing great yeah all right

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,039
everyone say something at least so we

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,000
can hear you

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,279
yeah good all right okay all right we

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,640
hear you all right

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,520
so we've got quite a few questions um

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,200
that have gathered this is a big panel

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,719
there's there's four people so

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,640
i'm going to start with manfred because

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,160
he was the first speaker

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,760
um so manfred the first question for you

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,920
the most votes on this question

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,160
it says is there any way is there an

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,480
easy way to manage angularjs or any

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,239
other json in a monorepo

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,000
where there are multiple apps and libs

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,280
are there any plans to split angular

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,400
json per app and lib

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,799
um not that i know of

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,400
but perhaps alex from the angular team

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,360
knows more about this

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,600
okay uh unfortunately not because i

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,720
don't work on on tooling directly but

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,560
that sounds like a great idea um

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,240
i would suggest file a feature request

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,400
on the angular cli repo

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,520
and that seems like something we could

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,960
work on designing

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,720
yeah yeah good okay cool thanks um

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,640
next question from manfred what is your

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,479
take on using learner versus

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,479
nx for managing mono repos

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,159
well it does not take much you can

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,000
download

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,320
it using npm init uh that means you just

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,720
need this command and it downloads a

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,520
script which is creating a

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,880
monorepo with the newest nx version and

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,000
that's it so

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,320
you can directly use it the more

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,600
interesting question is what does it

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,119
take if you have an

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,600
existing angular project because in that

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,000
case you need somehow to copy

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,800
your files over to the new mono

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,280
repository there is an upgrade script

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,360
but this only works if you have just one

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,800
angular application in your mono

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,599
repository

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,879
uh otherwise you need to copy everything

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,160
over by hand

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,879
and this is at first quite easy i mean

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,440
copying files is not a big deal but

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,599
if you copy over the files all your

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,319
things are coming up the things of the

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,959
past

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,000
you will notice that you have cyclic

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,160
dependencies

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,040
and this is the hardest part of it yeah

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,120
solving all the cyclic dependencies

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,599
when you just have a tiny amount of

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,080
projects you don't even notice them

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,640
but if you have a lot of projects you

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,800
know

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,239
the compiler is not that happy about

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,239
cyclic dependencies

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:59,920
so the question was your opinion on

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,920
learner versus nx

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,200
yeah so i prefer uh

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,920
nx because it is more lightweight

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,480
learner has the approach of having

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,360
a lot of different projects and those

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,280
projects are orchestrated by learner

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:23,200
with i have one project

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,480
and uh this project is wired up with all

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,720
the libraries using bath maps

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,879
okay cool all right thanks thanks

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,239
manfred next question is for one of the

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,120
other three i'm not sure

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,640
who it says where do you keep feature

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,480
flags

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,680
can you give a few examples of best

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,560
practices for these flags

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,000
yes so it's probably for me because um i

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,519
was talking about it

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,640
um one place to keep it would be

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,799
on your um on your

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,159
content management system itself because

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,480
as you can remember

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,720
this is something that you can pull live

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,920
so if you do want that ability to switch

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,040
it on and off

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,680
you can have a configuration uh key and

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,159
from there

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,280
you can switch on and off but if you're

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,879
using tools like

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,799
launch darkly um then that interface

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,280
itself will give you that ability

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,359
uh to switch on or off the flag from the

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,359
launch darkly interface itself

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,199
so it makes it uh if you use it uh tool

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,280
like that it's very powerful

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,639
i was talking about the servers they

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,360
also make sure that

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,280
all their um all their content is also

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,520
spread over the edge and you know

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,400
in like milliseconds your changes will

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,680
reflect on the site

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,160
awesome thanks michelle all right so the

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,440
next question is for wesley

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,639
best advice um questions not entirely

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,320
whole but i'm gonna

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,720
i'm gonna let you interpret and run with

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,400
it so the best advice

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,040
oh no no let me let me tell you the

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,360
question the question is

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:02,080
how to overcome guilty of talking

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,280
so oh yeah how do you overcome the

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,639
guilty of talking

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,639
feeling so

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,160
basically i think that ties into what i

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,400
was saying about shame

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,400
like because you are going to be judged

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,080
when you when you talk

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,639
when you speak and how you're presenting

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,120
yourself um

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,560
i can tell you the short answer that you

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
probably heard is that you just keep

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,039
doing it

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,720
and then you get used to it and then you

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,840
learn to adjust just to it

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,600
but like the really deep like

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,000
come to jesus question is like you need

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,320
to get some help uh the shame is one of

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,440
those things that it will eat you up and

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,320
it will

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,840
color everything and every interactions

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,280
including how you see yourself

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,000
so it's one of the things that follow

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,360
you even outside

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,440
of that is just like if you have an

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,880
eating problem but you're in solitary

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,960
confinement

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,720
you may be able to deal with it because

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,120
you don't have access to that

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,520
but you can't shield yourself away from

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,720
the world or that feeling

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,319
you're just avoiding the trigger so

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,840
if you can find a way of one

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,840
saying that it's okay we're all

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,680
different and accepting that

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,280
uh either getting some outside help

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,520
talking to your friends getting some

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,160
or even like before a talk or before

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,120
going to before going to a networking

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,199
vet

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,440
have your friends talk you up have them

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,880
remind you of how awesome you are

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,000
and why you are a person that is worth

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,280
knowing and why people want to

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,080
be friends with you um that is how you

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,199
kind of get over

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,960
it um by finding ways to to

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,280
to sidestep the shame as much as

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,720
possible um but

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,440
uh like i said this is about the media

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,720
and um our environment and what the

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,800
environment tells us

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,000
so make sure you realize that it's not

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,720
just you it's

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,160
it's it's so if this if this problem is

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,880
bigger than you because this is where it

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,479
came from

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,319
realize the solution is bigger than you

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,319
too and and get help

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,080
awesome thank you we have another

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,120
question for you wesley

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,759
um i think it's a hard one a lot of

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,880
people have this question um

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,160
how do you handle anxiety of

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,560
accidentally doing one of the don'ts

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,639
like oh like asking a question that

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,520
implies a specific status or saying too

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,440
much you know

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,080
yeah yeah yeah so it's if this is not

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,400
one of the the don'ts is not

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,240
uh if you do this you're dead uh you

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,599
just kill the conversation the the

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,400
don'ts are

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,680
be mindful of the stuff and try to still

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,319
steer away from it

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,639
because um the the more you don't do in

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,319
that list the better off you are

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,840
um the the it's like i said the way that

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,080
we learn networking it's not

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,599
through a class it's not something that

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,879
we're brought up doing it's something

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,440
that we are just

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,520
hearing other people do and we take

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,120
something or we watch a movie

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,960
uh and this is a lifetime of

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,479
conditioning so

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,400
the stuff that you saw on that list you

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,639
are gonna do just

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,080
it's like when you buy a brand new car

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,039
and then you start seeing that car

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,000
everywhere

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,800
awareness of what it is will make you

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,599
see it

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,879
and be able to spot it and once you do

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,199
that you'll be better at

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,319
not doing those things so it just make

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,479
sure that you

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,960
you give yourself some grace there it's

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,960
okay to do stuff on that list

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,319
i don't want to add to your anxiety

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,240
that's not the purpose

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,840
it's to make you feel a little bit more

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,320
comfortable by one

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,959
making sure that you uh know how to

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,279
start

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,640
and how to how to continue and if you

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,399
stumble on one of these things

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,640
i mean it doesn't kill a conversation

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,640
and just keep going okay

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:48,000
awesome advice thank you um so

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,240
next question is it possible to

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,920
structure a monorepo

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,000
in a way that you can check out only

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,880
part of it or a specific library from

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,880
within the project

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,800
yeah that's an interesting question so i

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,519
think

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,160
we don't have the technologies for that

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,480
but

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,200
this is exactly what the people at

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,360
google are doing i think they have their

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,399
own dueling that allows them to check

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,839
out the

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:19,360
mono repository or their one and only

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,360
repository badly

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,720
i don't know open uh open software that

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,279
is

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,720
doing this okay alex what do you think

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,120
yeah i was just gonna say i don't know

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,000
of anything in the the kind of external

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,480
ecosystem that

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,760
approximates that part of our our setup

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,760
um

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,120
i don't know how well something like git

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,600
sub module would interact with nx

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,880
for checking out specific parts of the

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,160
repo only

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,839
i imagine you could do something

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,720
creative there but i've not seen any

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,160
examples of that

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:57,760
set up in a pre-packaged way yet

00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,800
okay cool all right next question

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,360
um michelle

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,800
um this is a question about feature

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,880
toggles yeah

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,440
they say for new features do you remove

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,120
the

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
like for new features do you remove the

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,640
toggle later

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,079
is it not too many if else is in the

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,160
code like are you with with

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,279
tons and tons of feature toggles how do

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,079
you remove them

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,680
and the second part would be is it just

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,560
add too much complexity to your code to

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,640
if else everything like that

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,320
yeah well good point you know like i

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,279
said um it

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,040
you should only use use it when um if

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,079
you feel the need for it

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,279
if that feature is not that critical um

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,920
you know don't do it um don't over

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,000
engineer

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,000
always um but where is needed

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,240
if else statement is one way to do it

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,720
but you can also

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,200
do things like uh take advantage of

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,680
angular's uh dependency injection

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,800
so based on you know the value of the

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,720
flag

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,839
you could inject a different service

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,040
that

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,120
that does things differently for you um

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,120
so these are you know load a dynamic

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,320
component based on

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,600
you know the the flag value so this way

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,000
you know the killing the old feature is

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,959
taking it out would be easier but i have

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,079
to say that

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,680
it can be really messy sometimes uh for

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,320
example there's a change which you know

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,240
goes through

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,440
different files you have to change links

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,600
and stuff at

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,920
so many places then in that case these

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,120
are so many false statements

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,519
and we typically uh how we take out to

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,560
answer

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,959
that question we wait for the new one to

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,959
be

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,959
stable so when we are doing incremental

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,839
rollout we wait for it to go hundred

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,920
percent

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,600
and then you know wait uh for the next

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,079
release to take out the

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,120
the code which was uh for the old flow

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,160
and the

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,480
same thing goes um for anything a simple

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,200
feature on off flags as well once the

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,240
other

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,760
um you know once it's live and once it's

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,279
proven itself uh

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,279
it's always good to take with the dead

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,399
code because you definitely do not want

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,399
to increase your code base

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,079
okay awesome thank you

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,000
i have another question for you michelle

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:20,480
um hold on i had it where did it go

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,760
it switched it moved okay um

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,440
people want to know and i don't know if

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,440
you can answer this feel free to say no

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,680
um what headless cms

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,240
is delta using and do you recommend that

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,240
cms

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,839
well um i cannot uh talk specific

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,360
tools that's why i kept it a little

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,160
generic but to be honest if you really

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,079
uh

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,760
are good at pulling out info about a

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,320
site you can really do that

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,200
um there's a lot of options right now

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,360
and i was here

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,399
seeing someone share links about tools

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,399
as well so

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,320
you got a lot of um we obviously used

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,920
enterprise tools um

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,079
but there are tools at all levels for

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,040
your cms you know for small apps you

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,959
probably want to

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,720
go for something which which has low

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,560
licensing costs and you know

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,079
um so you've got a lot of options that's

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,519
all i'd say yeah

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,600
okay thank you uh all right manfred

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,360
do you have any recommended strategies

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,959
to slowly moving towards a clean

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,120
architecture

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,160
when your depth graph already looks like

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,279
a tangled coordinate analogy

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,560
yeah okay nice question

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,360
so i guess in this case as

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,079
you use this term it is causing pain for

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,480
you

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,399
and when it is causing pain for you i

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,360
would quickly move to another

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,240
architecture

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,000
i'm always asking a customer when i'm

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,199
coming to then where are your pain

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,279
points because

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,360
if there are no pain points it does not

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,399
make sense to change the architecture

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,199
just for fun

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,680
just to be one of the cool people but if

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,800
there are pain points then i would say

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,120
take some time perhaps a sprint set up

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,560
an

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,120
empty mono repository and try to copy

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,480
over

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,600
everything into tiny libraries and as

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,440
mentioned before

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,639
eighty percent of that is quite

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,760
straightforward

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,600
and in the rest uh twenty percent

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,600
you will struggle with cyclic

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,560
dependencies this is what you have to

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,279
solve

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,959
but most likely you will do it in one

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:23,199
spring this is what i've seen

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,240
awesome thanks manfred okay alex

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,160
question for you bud

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,839
um is there any way to force strict

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,800
errors to be reported

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:34,480
on every build after an initial ng serve

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,240
strict errors to be reported on every

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,880
build after the first ngc

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,560
yeah the person the person asking is

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,160
saying that they only see the errors on

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,839
the first build

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,839
but after that initial build like maybe

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,440
they make a change

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,920
the errors are not there anymore is what

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,399
they're claiming if that's the case it's

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,240
a bug

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,839
and uh if you file it with a

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,440
reproduction i will fix it

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,279
okay cool so we should be showing the

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,320
same errors on every compilation

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,920
okay cool all right

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,519
um all right wesley the next question is

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,240
for you

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,240
the top voted question right now it says

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,760
what if the other person does not stop

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,519
talking and goes on

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,519
what if the other person does not give

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,199
you the space to have your turn

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,199
and interrupts when you start talking

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,519
um if that bothers you then i would put

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,600
that person in the unaligned category

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,480
and use the tips to exit the

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,079
conversation by

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,040
going to the bathroom saying that you

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,639
need some air and taking a step out

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,560
saying that you know that you need to

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,279
refresh your drink

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,839
and there are ways to to do that that

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,959
actually

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,560
if for some reason if this person seems

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,120
like a good person like they have a good

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,639
heart

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,120
but it's just like you can't have this

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,320
conversation there are ways to

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,839
uh mitigate that by saying hey

00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,480
um who else do you know here

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,120
and where you can use that person and

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,000
that

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,320
uh their network to bring you into and

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,560
bring

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,440
a third person in um and that can help

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,240
temper

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,680
that circle of conversation so if they

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,279
it kind of like splits it so that they

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,959
can't dominate

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,120
um or you can take the person

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,399
who might that you've met previously

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,959
while you're networking

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,240
and introduce that person to that other

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,920
person

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,279
so that way you're not burning a bridge

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,959
you're finding a graceful way of exiting

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,279
or you're bringing in someone other

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,680
someone else to help you so that

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,240
if that person is so overpowering that

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,160
you can maybe spread that a little bit

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,000
perfect thank you all right i'm gonna do

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,120
our last question

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,120
for um

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,880
for top vote all right we're going to go

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,920
to

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,600
manfred last question what is the

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,920
recommended way for us to share

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,920
environment variables in our nx libs

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:07,839
so what i do is i make

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,640
all my libraries uh configurable

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,520
that means i have some way to pass some

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,319
data to

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,760
my libraries to my feature libraries to

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,240
my ohi libraries

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,760
i really try to prevent the situation

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,319
where there is a big

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,520
configuration service where everyone

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,199
depends upon

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,319
because in this case you have this

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,799
indemented situation i've talked about

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,080
but i like to read the configuration

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,160
data at the beginning

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,360
when the application starts and then

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,080
embossing the configuration data using

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,200
something like for root or using some

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,039
services

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,320
to the individual libraries

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,520
awesome okay

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,640
so i'm gonna ask you the four of you one

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,760
for you manfred

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,080
can you blog an example of that

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,799
of course okay and then for the four of

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,799
you

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,720
um a lot of people asking for your

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,840
