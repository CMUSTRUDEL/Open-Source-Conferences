Between an HTTP request and response lies a realm of decision and transformation under your command with HttpInterceptors. Add authentication headers, filter content, retry failed requests, react to errors, log traffic, control busy indicators, and just make stuff up. Interceptors are easy to write and test. They’re a good reason to polish your RxJS skills. After 20 minutes with me you’ll be in the room where it happens, just like Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson.
