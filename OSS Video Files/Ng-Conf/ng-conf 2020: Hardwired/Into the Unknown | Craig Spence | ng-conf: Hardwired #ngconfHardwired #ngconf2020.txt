Sven the reindeer and Olaf the snowman have a big problem! They‚Äôre creating a new TypeScript library, and they want to give developers who use their library the best possible experience. They know that TypeScript has incredible powers (they‚Äôre almost magical! üí´), but they don‚Äôt know exactly how to use them to their full potential.

They have so many questions! What is unknown? How is it different from any? How do you use infer? What are conditional types? Unions and Intersections?! It‚Äôs almost too much‚Ä¶

Thankfully Elsa, beloved Queen of Arendelle is a TypeScript master, and along with her sister Anna, they love to teach others all about type magic.

Come along with Elsa, Anna, Olaf and Sven, and learn all about advanced TypeScript typing by going INTO THE UNKNOWN üé∂‚ùÑÔ∏èüéµ
