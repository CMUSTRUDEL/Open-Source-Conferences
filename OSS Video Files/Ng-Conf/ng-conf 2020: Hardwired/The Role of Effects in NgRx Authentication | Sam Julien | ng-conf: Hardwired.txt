Building token authentication into an NgRx application can be overwhelming and confusing. Authentication is already a big, scary subject and so is NgRx. When you put them together, things get confusing fast. In this talk, we’ll do a comparison of how authentication in a vanilla Angular app differs from auth in an NgRx app. We’ll then see how the central nervous system of authentication shifts from a service in regular Angular to Effects in NgRx.

This talk will be practical and code-driven, leaving you equipped to tackle adding this feature to your NgRx application at work on Monday. You’ll learn how Effects can handle loading authentication state, navigate users to protected routes, and process tokens received from an identity provider. By the end, you’ll feel way better about tackling auth in NgRx!
