influenced Alan Turing to create the

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:36,210
first ever Turing machine which was

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,790
originally a coffee maker he started the

introduced the unsubscribed method into

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,690

you're currently facing at work well

00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:39,420
yeah now that I think about it we do

00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:39,930
have a big issue in our project let me

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,069
guess

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,660
I can see something about the library

00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:48,209
called

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,680
moment.js which handles dates and times

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:53,190
Wow

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,269
and your act appends on this library but

00:02:53,190 --> 00:03:00,959
but you want to replace it with another

00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:05,519
library called bait functions that's

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,980
amazing how did you do that I have

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,040
special powers

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:14,970
now tell me how many parents of the app

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,389
depend on boom enjoy yes a lot and we

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,389
also have like 1000 tests running hmm

00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:23,370
you don't want to break all these tests

00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:26,579
and also don't want to break your app

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,520
when you replace it date functions

00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:32,790
exactly okay

00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:40,560
