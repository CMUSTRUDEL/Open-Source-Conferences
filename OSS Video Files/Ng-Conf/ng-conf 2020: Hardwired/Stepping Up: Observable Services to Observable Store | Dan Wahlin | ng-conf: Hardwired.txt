Observable Services (also known as Subject in a Service) provide a great way for components to subscribe to changes that occur in a service. But how do you step your app up to the next level and create a state store that also supports notifications?

In this talk Dan Wahlin will show a simple yet powerful option called Observable Store that works across all front-end applications (Angular, React, Vue.js, and more). Learn how to store your state, access it, work with immutable store state, provide state change notifications, the role of RxJS and Subjects, debugging options, and more.
