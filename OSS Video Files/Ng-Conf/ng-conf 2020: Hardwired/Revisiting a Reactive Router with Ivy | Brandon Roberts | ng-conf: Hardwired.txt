The release of Ivy opens up new possibilities of routing in Angular. Optional NgModules, lazy loading components, and dynamically creating components on the fly. The Angular Router is very powerful already, but what if we took a fresh look at a reactive router in this new world. This talk talks about the history of the router, and the process of building a new reactive router.
