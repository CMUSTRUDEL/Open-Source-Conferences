00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,080
but i'm actually really excited for us

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,599
to this is

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,760
super cool this is like the first time

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,160
that ng-conf is going to be online um so

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,280
i'm

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,200
really excited about this um so i'm one

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,640
of the co-founders of stack blitz uh

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,480
for those of you who may not have heard

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,920
of it uh you might have actually used it

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,840
if you've ever gone to like the angular

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,079
docs and run one of the live examples

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,680
that's actually running on our stuff

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,000
we basically have vs code running in a

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,000
browser lets you really rapidly

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,039
uh build and prototype and debug angular

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,199
applications

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,480
uh so in the next five minutes i want to

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,280
actually show you some of the stuff that

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,879
we've shipped

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,079
this year and also some of the stuff

00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,640
that we're gonna be shipping later this

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,680
year

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,359
uh and 2020 is turning out to be really

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,040
one of our biggest years yet

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,560
uh so to kind of give you an idea some

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,560
of the stuff that's that's uh

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,840
we've been shipping the past few months

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,159
we've now got themes

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,920
so you can bring your favorite theme uh

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,280
you switch between various themes pretty

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,400
soon you're going to be able to actually

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,759
instead of asking your friends like hey

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,439
what theme is that you'll actually be

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,240
able to just go to their profile in one

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,119
click

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,600
have it be your theme too really cool we

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,759
also have

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,000
you know great productivity boosters you

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,759
know from vs code like auto import and

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,439
zen mode so you can just kind of get rid

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,000
of all of your distractions and

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,759
just focus on your code and one of the

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,439
big things about stack blitz is we want

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,119
to be the fastest place for you to

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,119
get your ideas into your keyboard and

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,280
then get a result from the computer

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,040
and so speed has always been really our

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,520
number one feature and then always will

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,280
be

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,600
and our team's been working really hard

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,159
on uh making our stuff even faster than

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,240
it was

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,600
and we've actually beat our rebundling

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,840
speeds by 5x

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,960
so when you type in code and when you

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,719
load a project

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,399
uh that stuff is just like near instant

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,200
at this point and we've also reworked

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,439
our ui

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,240
from the ground up uh to be incredibly

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,840
snappy

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,680
and so i'll show you that a little bit

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,360
here but the speed improvements are

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,959
especially important for

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,200
you know for us angular developers one

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,319
of the big things this year right is ivy

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,319
uh the super cool new technology and on

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,520
stackless it is incredibly it's like the

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,280
fastest environment

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,879
on the planet to be building iv

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,640
applications right

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,720
and so again this is just some of the

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,560
stuff we've shipped in the past 60 days

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,160
um and we have a whole lot more that's

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,560
coming down the pipe and i'll get to

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,720
that

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,239
in a couple of minutes here but while we

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,120
go ahead let's take a quick test drive i

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,519
want to show you

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,480
i'll show you this stuff in action um so

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,879
we're going to go ahead and

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,879
start on the stack let's home page

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,640
and i'm going to go down and i'm going

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,840
to

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,840
start a new angular

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,840
oh no i get anywhere

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,959
yeah it looks like my internet

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,959
connection is unstable

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,040
i knew it okay i think uh i think it

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,560
might be back

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,680
okay all right so i think my internet

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,200
just went out for a second there but

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,640
anyways all right so we've got a project

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,239
running here you see it's booted up

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,840
so let's go ahead and start with uh auto

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,080
import and so

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,200
in from the angular core package uh they

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,519
have a version

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,480
uh export in there so i'm going to type

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,840
in version

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,080
and you'll see we have the auto import

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,239
here i can hit tab boom it automatically

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,120
pulls that in right pretty neat

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,799
and uh so i got this object object here

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,480
so i'm going to go ahead and

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,920
type full because that'll give us the

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,159
full version you can see

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,040
we're on angular 9.1.0 which is super

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,920
cool

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,200
um again we've i got uh our theme

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,280
toggling so if you know when you do

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,319
presentations uh or sometimes you know

00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,680
in the middle of the day the dark theme

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,200
might not be what you want you can just

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,879
one click switch to light theme

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,239
you know just really fast this is even

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,959
faster than like vs code will switch

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,080
your theme

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,799
um just really neat got zen mode

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,480
gets all of your uh the the

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,799
miscellaneous ui out of the way so it's

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,880
just your code in the preview

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,079
really nice feature there and you'll

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,560
kind of notice that the ui

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,840
is just really snappy it feels kind of

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
like you're behind the wheel of like a

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,280
supercar

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,240
and that's uh very intentional our our

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,800
ui

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,000
our main ui folk uh tomak has been

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,280
working really hard on this took him a

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,240
couple months to really rebuild this

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,000
from the ground up

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,759
um so it just feels like a really

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,400
amazing experience

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,479
um so of course again as angular

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,400
developers to enable ib right if i want

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,000
this application to be compiled with ivy

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,479
we've made that really easy you just go

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,680
to settings underneath angular cli

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,720
you can click enable ivy and you can see

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,759
down here it's uh getting our imv uh

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,120
compiler set up with ngcc getting this

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,280
ready to rock and roll

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,800
i opened up my ts config and actually

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,720
updated that stuff in here

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,240
um and you'll see this has been updated

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,960
this is actually the iv compiled

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,039
application

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,800
right that was like super easy to set up

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,080
um and so the hot reloads are even

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,720
faster so let's go ahead and just type

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,479
some stuff in

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,000
see how fast that hover goes right

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,600
pretty crazy um

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,199
so again we want stacklets to be the

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,800
fastest environment for you to write

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,639
code in and get your ideas

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,000
uh into the computer and actually live

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,759
and so our team actually

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,520
wanted to make something for you all and

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,680
it's kind of fun kind of cool

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,880
so i'll show it to you here um it's this

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,240
thing and you might notice this is the

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,919
same thing that's on my t-shirt

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,639
so you might be wondering what the heck

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,840
is this um and so this is actually

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,360
a real javascript

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:44,479
in here uh this is all

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,360
valid every single one of this

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,240
is valid javascript and what this

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,039
program does

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,759
is the cool part is that it actually

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,360
right

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,360
so what's cool is i'm gonna go ahead let

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,199
me uh let me split the screen real quick

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,639
here i'm gonna split this over here

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,400
i'm gonna go ahead and because it's an

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,240
svg i can copy and paste the text

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,759
elements i'm gonna copy this paste in my

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,639
javascript console here so i can

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,919
you can kind of see all of the code that

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,800
came there again every single line

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,160
totally valid

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,960
and when i hit enter it procedurally

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,639
generates

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,120
this image again and i and you can keep

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,240
doing this over and over and over

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,880
so it's kind of cool it's like an

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,319
infinite printing loop right

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,360
so uh we have these t-shirts we're gonna

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:30,319
hand them out but

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,680
um we have we ordered them anyways we've

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,199
got like a thousand of them

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,080
so if email eric at staffordshire.com

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,520
we'll send one of these to you we also

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,840
have this like equal poster here

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,600
um but just something fun and cool and

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,360
you know this is actually one of those

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,120
actually quite a difficult problem to

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,880
make this work it took you know maybe a

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,479
thousand iterations to get it just right

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,080
because it's a very hard chicken and egg

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,919
problems make something like this

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,360
um took us a couple of hours on a plane

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,120
flight whereas if we were working on our

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,199
local environment it would have taken

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,639
you know at least a day if not more and

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,319
so that just kind of goes to show

00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,759
you know the experience that we're

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,240
building with stack blitz we want to be

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,800
able to

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,800
enable you to create uh your best work

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,560
uh without having the impediment of a

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,199
slow environment uh in your way

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,880
right so that's uh that's kind of an

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,479
update on on what's currently available

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,560
on production right now

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,800
um i want to quickly uh tell you about

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,000
some stuff that we were launching today

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,880
and something that's coming

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,680
uh in a little bit but first i need to

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,479
need to know if

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,280
you all can keep a secret and actually

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,720
if you can keep

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,000
two secrets because we've got we have

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
two things that we want to tell you

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,400
about

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,160
i'm hoping the answer is yes so the

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,840
first thing is actually

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,199
uh uh one of the

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,319
biggest requests you all have for us

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,319
is can i run stack blitz inside of my

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,479
company my answer is finally yes

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,240
as of today we now support running

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,720
stacklets on-prem

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,680
uh or in a vpc we can even have this air

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,039
gapped on-prem

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,039
and we've scaled this to the largest

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,160
companies in the world and so if you're

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,879
interested in this if you want to get

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,800
stacked with

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,720
your company you just shoot an email to

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,840
enterprise stackblitz.com that actually

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,280
just goes straight to me

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,560
and so we'll get the ball rolling on

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,680
getting you and your company set up the

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,120
stack blitz

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,080
uh and the other thing we're working on

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,120
this year is actually kind of bonkers

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:18,000
considering we are an online ide

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:21,599
because it's a desktop application

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,639
um and

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,400
it's a

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,680
pretty interesting it's not it's not

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,800
like anything you you've ever seen but

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,919
we've known you're using not having to

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,159
install it get it configured

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,919
same thing with npm uh it even reduced

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,159
the size of your node modules all the

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,399
stuff that stackless.com gives you

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,680
the speed and iteration cycles but as a

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,800
desktop app

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,080
tied to your local fs right um

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,680
and so we've got more than we're going

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,240
to announce on this uh and it'll be

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,600
coming

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,040
