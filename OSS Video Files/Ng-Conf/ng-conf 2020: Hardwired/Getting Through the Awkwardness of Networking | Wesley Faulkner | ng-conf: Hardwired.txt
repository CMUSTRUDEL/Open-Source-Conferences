There’s a lot about modern networking that we all should un-learn. Showing off your knowledge and targeting the “important” connections is the wrong approach. If you genuinely want to be an effective networker, you have to shift away from looking at these interactions as transactional. That said, it’s still hard to find people to talk to, and even harder to know how to start up a conversation. I’ll give you tips that will help you work through those issues and ultimately make you more comfortable in new spaces with new people. You’ll come away from this presentation with advice you can put to use immediately.

[Music]

00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,980
[Applause]

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,920
[Music]

00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:16,640
[Applause]

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:16,640
[Music]

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,720
uh before i get started

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,680
um i want to talk about the elephant in

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,039
the virtual room

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:29,039
which is that um covet 19 happened

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,400
before uh before i submitted this before

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,800
it was accepted so

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,239
this is a pre-social distancing edition

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,280
about how to get over

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,840
the awkwardness of networking um

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,520
some of the advice does translate into

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,399
online networking so it's

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,600
it's not a total loss so i'll i'll do my

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,320
best to point out those

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,840
modifications where uh you can do the

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,440
same thing but just

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,559
virtually okay and uh before we start i

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,480
want to make sure that we

00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,879
get into the same mindset as

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,960
how i wrote this presentation so what i

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,680
would like for you to do

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,000
is including everyone at home go ahead

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,640
uh

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,080
think about the people that you love the

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,280
the people that in your life that you

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,520
hold dear

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,320
and go ahead and make a mental list so

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,880
run through that list

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,799
okay when i want you to hold that hold

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,080
that in your in your in your

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,040
mind and uh

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,439
that's that feeling of those people

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,360
makes me smile personally

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,680
um and um i bet it does

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,360
makes you feel happy just hearing or

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,840
just visualizing those people in your

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,640
mind

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,759
okay now we're to do the same exercise

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,759
but instead

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,360
i would like for you to think about the

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,560
people that you're connected to

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,439
on linkedin okay

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,320
so you're probably understanding where

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,240
i'm going with this

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,840
is that you don't feel the same way

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,360
about the people that you connect with

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,960
on linkedin

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,680
um so the the thing is what we do is

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,680
um when we connect with someone when we

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
think about networking

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,440
we're not talking about truly connecting

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,080
what we're talking about

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,120
is collecting so we're just collecting

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,200
people it's not

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,040
a deep meaningful connection that you

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,720
take

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,160
throughout a relationship when you're

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,599
talking about networking

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,480
um so what if i'm saying something

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,959
that's new

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,000
that's that's fine if you're questioning

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,080
what i'm saying

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
this is a totally different approach to

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,120
networking that you might be used to

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,680
so um buckle in this is gonna be just

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,400
a different kind of networking so

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,920
instead of

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,519
talking about collecting people we're

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,280
going to talk about actually making

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,280
long meaningful connections

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,560
okay

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,599
there we go so um this is me

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,159
well it's it's part of me anyway um

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,519
these are some things that to me make me

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,879
feel different

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,360
um there's like

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,200
i'm a minority which is pretty obvious

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,480
uh i'm a black man

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,280
um i am uh

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,040
an immigrant my what my parents are i

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,400
they grew up in different places and

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,200
around the world

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,000
um and so i'm a first generation

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,560
american

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,080
so culturally things are a little odd

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,080
for me still

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,239
even though i grew up here because of

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,080
the way that i was raised

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,440
my parents also weren't very educated

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,120
so i don't have their network

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,560
to rely on because as people grow up

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,200
they are

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
they get exposed to their friends their

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,319
friends

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,040
network and that's how they get exposed

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,040
to networking

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,840
so that is something that is just

00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:01,040
not part of me we grew up poor

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,799
and one big thing for me is that i

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,040
am neurodivergent and if you don't know

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,040
what that is it means that i think

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,200
differently than other people i'm i'm

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,640
literally wired differently

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,519
and um if you look through the list some

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,639
of these things

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,160
i can hide and some of them i can't

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,000
so this list is basically a list of

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,280
worries so whenever

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,240
i meet someone this is kind of what i

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,040
worry about

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,000
an impression that if they knew about it

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,520
knew about this about

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,880
me how would they feel and now your list

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,960
might be

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,440
extremely similar or just very very

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,560
different depending on your background

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,320
and it doesn't need to be so

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,680
entrenched on who you are it could be

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,560
something that

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,320
um you're going through so if you just

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,360
lost your job which a lot of people are

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,880
unfortunately

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,800
if you are divorced um

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,720
let's if you're not a native english

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
speaker you might have an accent or not

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,320
speak as well

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,000
or you might feel unattractive these are

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,800
things that when we go to a networking

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,039
event

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,320
that we are bringing with us and we

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,880
can't separate them

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,479
this is not like your resume where you

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,360
can just highlight all the good stuff

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,479
this is what you're bringing and uh

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,280
you're putting it out there

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,280
and this is things that people are going

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,919
to see about you

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,360
and in some cases this is what people

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,520
are gonna judge you on

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,600
um even the stuff that's not under your

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,880
control and that's

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,320
extremely scary um

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,520
what we do is we compare ourselves to

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,160
this ideal this uh

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,080
perfect person this person who has this

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,199
magnetic personality

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,320
um and that's what we think of um

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,520
when we consume media as a

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,639
a reason to go out and network and the

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,919
type of people who are successful at it

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:06,560
one thing also that this does bring

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,759
and that thing is called shame um that

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,800
feeling

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,800
of shame is what kind of what this list

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,919
that i put down translates to

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,880
depending on how you feel about it or

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,400
how you're told

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,400
to feel about it so um

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,479
pain is a very painful emotion and let

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,240
me just read the definition of shame

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:31,440
um it's a painful emotion caused by

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,160
consciousness of guilt it's also a

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,120
condition

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,880
of humiliating disgrace or disrepute

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,479
so when we expose ourselves to

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,680
networking when we expose ourselves to

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,880
other people

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,000
this is kind of what we're exposing or

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,680
putting out there and it begs the

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,919
question why go through this

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,120
why go through this and the reason is

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,120
because

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,319
networking has its advantages and here's

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,360
a here's just a few

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,120
like um you can

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,120
learn different perspectives like when

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,080
you are out in the community

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,360
you are touching every person and

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,360
hearing their opinions

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,280
on different subjects and so you feel

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,720
like you can get a pulse on what the

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,479
community is thinking

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,960
um you can play match maker you can

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,840
help others who are looking for someone

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,960
or something

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,639
and others who uh are

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,160
also trying to make that match and when

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,840
you put them together

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,440
it can feel really good and um

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,880
it helps your self-esteem because if

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,599
you're good at networking let's

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,120
let's be honest um some of these

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,400
hang-ups some of the things that make

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,080
you so scared

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,599
um if you feel you're good at something

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,879
it's not so hard

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,639
to move forward and do it and so i list

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,160
this and i almost pulled it out because

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,720
it's the advantages of networking which

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,400
we all kind of know

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,800
but what is the purpose of networking

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,160
the purpose of networking is to form a

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,199
stronger bond

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,319
with the people in your community and

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,440
with those bonds it allows things like

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:13,280
this to happen

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:15,440
but it shouldn't be the mere focus of

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,160
trying to get something but it should be

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:23,039
trying to strengthen the relationship

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:26,080
so why is it so hard

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,759
um well i think we all know

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,800
that it's uncomfortable i kind of went

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,919
through that you're kind of making

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,839
yourself exposed

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,560
you are um sharing parts of yourself

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,719
that

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,800
you don't want to but that's kind of the

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,599
point um

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,519
you don't you don't like to talk to

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,200
people or you don't even just know

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,279
how to talk to people how do you even

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,399
get started um

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,200
well i i want to say that just to

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,880
remember

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,360
people that you're interacting with

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,279
are most likely in the same boat as you

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,399
um they

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,040
they um are a little awkward they're

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,480
afraid

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,360
of being seen and being judged and

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,200
found to not meet the other person's

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,160
expectation

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,600
so uh it's all when you're in a group

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,760
when you're in a networking event it's

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,200
almost like you're all at a dance

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,519
um but no one has agreed

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,120
to lead so you're kind of stuck at an

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,000
impasse about how you get started and

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,000
how you move forward

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,959
so i mentioned about the media and what

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,959
it's taught us

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,560
about what networking is and so

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,040
i just compiled the list and put this

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,440
together so you can see for yourself of

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,440
and some of these kind of stand out um

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,240
be transactional so find someone who

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,279
needs your product or service or looking

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,959
for something

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,560
that you're offering and do an exchange

00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,800
saying hey i see you need

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,200
x or i offer y and you try to find that

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,560
match

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,800
so it's very transactional next

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,320
is dominance like people have been

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,440
taught that you need to control the

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,360
conversation

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,200
you need to make sure that you overpower

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,640
the person that you're speaking with

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,600
with facts or

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,600
with your degrees or your expertise and

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,040
you just basically show off

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,200
why you matter why you're valuable

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,200
and that kind of ties in with the firm

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,480
handshake have you heard of that

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,800
when you meet someone or if you're

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,600
at an event make sure you grab their

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,320
handshake

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,480
and shake it firmly um that is a way of

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,519
translating power of like i'm a powerful

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,040
person

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,800
um this is all the kind of stuff that

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,120
we've been taught um

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,360
and another one is um to give out your

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,040
card so before you even meet someone you

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,240
give them your card

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,480
and that is one to show that uh

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,480
you have a job and you want to make sure

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,880
that they have your contact information

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,399
because they need to know that for some

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,240
reason rather than the first five

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,839
seconds of talking to you

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:11,040
um and it's a way of

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,600
setting the tone and showing off

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,399
what you do because you're represented

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,240
by

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,720
that card right so it is also a show of

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,959
privilege of being in a position to be

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,200
important enough to have cards made

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,640
um another thing that we've been taught

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,000
is to

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,519
talk about uh talk to have the person

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,680
talk about themselves because

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,959
people love to talk about themselves so

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,720
if you want to get started

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,720
in networking what you do is you just

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,839
say hey tell me tell me what you do

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,399
tell me tell me about you and then every

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,399
question

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,600
after that feels like an interrogation

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,600
really how long you've been there

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,000
what do you who are your clients and

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,360
that's not connecting that's that's more

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,600
of a

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,399
let me see if i can extract everything

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,279
that i can

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,920
to see if you fit into the list of

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,959
someone

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,800
that is worthy of me talking to

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,120
or if i can use you in some way or

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,639
do you have something valuable to either

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:16,560
to sell me or that i can sell to you

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,880
so when people ask

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,240
what you do that's kind of a key into

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,480
that because they're kind of

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,480
putting it out there saying where are

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,760
you in the level of my importance

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,000
and so uh that's one thing that we we

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,839
hear and that we've seen and if you've

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,839
been to a networking event you probably

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,600
this list probably looks very very

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,839
familiar to you

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,839
um so

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,839
this is if this is the stuff that we've

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,079
been taught

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,279
and i just went over about what not to

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,480
do

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:54,079
the question is okay so what do you do

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,320
and so what you do and here's a few

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,680
basics

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,680
is that um

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,079
you do eye contact and i i'm

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,000
sure you're familiar with this same with

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,560
listening and don't interrupt

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,240
but this is the reason for it the eye

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,399
contact

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,480
is to keep you from being distracted

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,120
it's to show that you're engaged

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,839
and it is to make sure that you walk in

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,839
on the conversation

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,880
so um personally i get have a tendency

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,200
to

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,519
see people walking around see someone

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,600
who might be

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,279
angular famous walking by and then

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,160
you're like oh that's

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,279
so and so and you might gravitate so if

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,199
you keep your eye

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,959
contact that actually keeps you from

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,240
being distracted

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,360
um and here's another one

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,320
listen and don't interrupt um

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,360
we commonly listen to something that

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,360
someone says

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,680
like when we're getting to know each

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,000
other and then we clue in

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,880
on the thing that sounds interesting to

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,760
us

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,720
blah blah blah blah blah i work at this

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,639
big company

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,240
blah blah oh you work in that big

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,720
company that is pretty cool i

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,920
interviewed for for a job there what is

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,440
it like to work for

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,720
x company um so what you do is you

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,360
clue in on the thing that you're

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,360
interested in and you signal

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,360
you know hey that's that's what i want

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,199
to talk about

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,399
what you should try to do when you first

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,120
meet someone and

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,040
you start talking is to go ahead and let

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,680
them talk

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,880
and wait until they're done talking i

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,519
know it sounds simple but

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,399
it is really hard to do especially when

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,079
you're looking for an

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,760
n and the reason for that

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,360
is because you want to make sure that

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,320
they are able to say everything they

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,600
want to say

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,920
it makes it might feel odd but practice

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,279
it

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,000
and see how it goes for you um and i

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,000
mentioned

00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,399
how this translates some of this into

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,360
online life and sometimes if you're

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,720
chatting with someone

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,160
over let's say whatsapp or some other

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,240
chat client

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,519
you'll see the dots or whatever and you

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,360
can tell they're typing but you see

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,680
something you want to respond to

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,720
go ahead and wait for the chat to finish

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,320
and then

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,320
formulate your response after that

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,199
and what you want to do is not focus on

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,320
what to say next

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,440
this is what what i do constantly i'm

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,399
looking at someone i'm like uh-huh

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,000
uh-huh uh-huh

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,519
oh ex-company i'm gonna bring that up

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,959
and then you're like uh-huh uh-huh

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,440
and then you're thinking about all the

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:38,399
things about x company

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,120
or whatever you're like walking on to

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,160
and

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,040
you just almost delete their

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,120
conversation

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,560
or what they're saying after that you

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,800
don't want to do that

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,959
um keep engaged keep listening

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
um and if it gets you to the point where

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,079
you forget

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,079
that you wanted to talk about that thing

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,000
that is fine

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,440
but what you want to do is stay engaged

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,639
and try to bring in

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,639
everything that they're saying

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,000
and you want to smile and the smile

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,680
kind of goes with the eye contact it's

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,639
not just to show that you're engaged and

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,399
it keeps you from being

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:19,040
distracted but smiling helps

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,759
one show that you're friendly you are a

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,360
person that's approachable

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,399
um it actually colors the way that you

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,480
talk

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,759
if you are on a job interview and it's

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,440
just a phone interview

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,279
when you smile you'll sound a lot

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,839
happier than if you don't

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,480
there's been studies that show that you

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,519
can hear

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,720
when someone's smiling not just see it

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:45,440
so it is a visual cue that you

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,040
are engaged and that you that you like

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,440
being in this conversation

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,199
but it's also for you too to make sure

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,079
that what you're saying

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,639
has a nice positive ring to it and

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,759
you're

00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,399
giving it in the best vein

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,320
um not sure if smiling helps while you

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,360
are doing a text chat online

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,199
but uh couldn't hurt but try

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,760
and here's this last part and i saved it

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,480
for last but it's really super important

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,919
um people want to be wholly seen and

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,880
what does that mean

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:21,679
um when i said before

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,160
when people say like what do you do that

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,360
is

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,039
one aspect of you yes but it's not the

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,320
complete you

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,080
um the complete you is that

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,840
resume list all the good things about

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,880
you from previous jobs and what your

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,039
hobbies are

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,640
and the clubs that you're a part of but

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,240
the whole you is also

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:47,200
that list that sadly would say might

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,039
feel like you have a lot of shame around

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,120
and remember when i thought when i said

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,480
think of that list of people

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:58,640
that are in your life that

00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,840
that you love or have love for you

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:05,120
they are usually the people who see you

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,240
all of you the the your successes your

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,320
failures

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,760
um the places where you stumble and fall

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,760
down and the places where you soar

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,400
and ultimately

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,720
to make a deeper connection you're going

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,600
to have to bring your whole self

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,600
to a conversation

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,520
but how do you do that when you're

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,559
struggling with all the shame

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,280
or you don't know where to start

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,080
these basics help but i'm going to move

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,480
into some

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,480
actual practical tips

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,919
okay if you're having live anxiety

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,600
with uh going to places to

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:52,400
to network show up early

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,360
it's a lot easier talking to a few

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,400
people

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,360
before the event starts and

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,480
then going into the room where there is

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,840
a whole bunch of bustle

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,200
and people have already paired up and

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,039
you're like i don't know where to go and

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,520
it can be a little overwhelming

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,080
even for this conference the chat

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,720
started

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,840
like 20 minutes before the actual

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,440
keynote

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,880
and people were chatting and getting to

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,400
know each other and the volume was

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,440
extremely manageable

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,799
so this one definitely uh

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,640
can be done online but when you go out

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,919
there and you go to places

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,880
um if the venue is not even open start a

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,799
line

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,960
uh then it's pretty obvious who to chat

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,720
with the person in front of you in line

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,960
and the person behind you and that's

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,799
super manageable

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,320
one thing uh in terms of lowering your

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,799
anxiety level

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,840
is to scout the venue if it's local

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,480
drive by it

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,280
see how big it is see if there's a patio

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,840
uh

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:54,960
understand if uh where the bathrooms are

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,320
if uh if it's wheelchair chair

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,600
accessible if you need that kind of

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,000
accommodation that kind of thing that

00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,440
you

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,919
you don't want to worry about at the

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,919
last minute also with

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,159
google maps you can use street view and

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,720
you can do this too or

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,799
look up the venue online specifically a

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,440
lot of venues for events

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,320
put their floor plan out there so that

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,880
you can

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,000
see that if you wanted to book the venue

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,440
and you can use that

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,760
information to know where the entrances

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,159
are

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,679
the bathrooms where the high traffic

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,120
areas are

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,280
when you go into the venue you don't

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,640
want to stand in a place

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,960
where people are constantly going to the

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,679
bar or going to the buffet

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,240
and you have to keep shifting in order

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,559
to

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,600
get out dodge people and that just makes

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,200
you uncomfortable because it makes you

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
worry about all the stuff going around

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,120
you

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,360
and it breaks that focus that i told you

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,600
about so practically

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,960
stand in a place where there's where

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,760
you're going to be comfortable

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,919
indoor outdoor if you're sensitive to

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,799
air conditioning or if you need

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,480
fresh air and make sure that you're in a

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,799
place where you don't have to

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,200
um worry about all the things going

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,799
around you

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,280
okay and now you might be wondering okay

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,320
all right i'm here i showed up there are

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,880
people

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,280
uh how do i actually start that

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,320
engagement

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,240
so um if you're naturally

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,159
able to engage people but then the

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,039
conversation fizzles

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,600
um because you're keeping eye contact

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,240
and

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,840
you were not interrupting and now you're

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,039
in that place that i alluded to before

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,760
we forgot

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,799
what you're going to talk about so this

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,799
works in terms of

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,559
continuing a conversation or even

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:43,200
starting one is to focus on the journey

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,320
so the journey is we're all on this

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,679
journey right yeah

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,320
as people um there is something in our

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,080
life

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,159
that causes us to be where we are

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,679
physically or virtually

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,679
and there's someone in the person you're

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,120
trying to interact with that brought

00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,640
them to that place

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:04,320
so are they looking to learn more

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,760
about angular are they um there because

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,520
they're just getting started and this

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:12,880
sound like a good place to meet people

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,600
there are several ways that our lives

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,440
intersect with other people

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,200
and no matter who you're talking to

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,559
what what in their life they're going

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,679
through

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,960
the journey is something that is common

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,520
so it doesn't matter if it's i don't

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,159
know

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,880
the president of the united states or

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,159
someone

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,120
who is homeless and

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,000
or a server who's working the venue it

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,280
doesn't matter who they

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,720
are you can always connect with the

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,039
journey

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,000
and that journey goes both ways it's how

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:54,000
far back is to where'd you grow up

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,400
and how did you physically get here

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,360
as to what sessions did you go to before

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,640
this

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,679
to the journey of after what do you

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,600
think you're going to do with the

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,200
knowledge that you learned

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,360
when is your flight what hotel

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,440
did you stay at and is that commute hard

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,120
but that might be a little over

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,559
crossing some lines so worry about don't

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,520
do that one um

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,200
but the journey continues and this is

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,159
just one part of it what session are you

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,039
gonna go to next

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,159
there there are ways to tie the journey

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,280
that's common

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,000
no matter who you're talking to um and

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,120
what you want to do is um when you're

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,320
talking to someone

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,159
and you're especially if you're talking

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,360
about their journey try not to bring

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,400
in all these things that

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,919
could make them feel judged too

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:47,279
stay away from like um money of course

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,159
class like are you the the vp or are you

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,120
uh

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,039
are you or you own your own company or

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,080
if you're just a direct report or you

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,200
just started or you're an

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,159
intern stay away from like class and

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,000
title

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,400
and um even labels um

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,600
like oh are you married or do you have

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,360
kids um

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,440
that might be part of a person but let

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,679
them volunteer that information

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,120
don't make assumptions oh you're married

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,360
what is his or her name

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,360
um what if it's a same-sex part sex

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,000
partner what if they did just lose their

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,240
job don't

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,600
ask them what they do there are things

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,440
that you can talk about

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,600
that won't touch on some of these key

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,720
areas where people

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,600
might feel shame or you might push them

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,360
away

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,840
or in some terms show that you're not

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,200
part of the same fabric of of people

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,520
that we all are part of

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,240
so stay away from some of these status

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,559
questions

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,240
that can be sep that can separate you

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:48,880
from from the person you're talking to

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,240
but that being said if you need to leave

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,360
the conversation

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,640
um and i'll touch on this later in the

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,240
summary

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,760
um but if you need to leave the

00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,559
conversation there are some really good

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,039
ways to

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,400
to get out of there virtually makes this

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,159
a lot easier because you can say

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,679
hey i have another meeting or i have to

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,440
hop out um

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,159
but say you have to go to the bathroom

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,480
no one's going to stop you

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,159
say you have to get some air say you

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,520
have to refill a drink

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,679
uh those are ways to get out of a

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,799
conversation politely but don't do it

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,080
rudely

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,480
um and when you're done

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,080
with this successful networking thing

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,120
what you want to do is also follow up

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,799
with them

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:33,520
keep in mind this is a connection for

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,520
hopefully your lifetime and not just

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:39,200
someone you're collecting

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,520
so follow up with them so get their

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,559
linkedin emails twitter whatever but

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,559
what you want to do is

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,320
ask for that information you don't give

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,440
them your card or tell them to connect

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,480
with you

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,159
you ask for that information let them

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,480
know you're interested

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,480
and

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,799
when you ask them hey can we stay in

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,159
touch

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,440
get their method of contact that works

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,679
best for them

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,080
whether it's you know a text message or

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,120
an email or linkedin or twitter or

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,120
whatever

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,159
ask them hey what is the best way of

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,080
staying in touch

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,440
don't just assume hey i really only

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,400
really do email so i'm just going to

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,159
email you

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,039
ask them how they would prefer to be

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,880
contacted and

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,400
the last thing on this list is you know

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,880
don't overdo it

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,880
uh don't over share all that list of the

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,600
this is what i'm ashamed of and this is

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,960
me

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:36,080
no i mean don't don't go all into

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,640
far ends of this territory and same

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:42,000
thing with like listing your resume

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,559
and don't connect everywhere

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,440
don't go through people use everything

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,919
in moderation

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,919
use your best judgment don't overdo it

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,840
okay so i just quick recap um no it's

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,960
okay to be

00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,000
uncomfortable uh know

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,240
that um it's very

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,919
key to be interested in the other person

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,480
and what they're saying

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,880
it's not all about you focus on the

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,880
journey whenever you need to connect

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,240
don't waste time on the other line and

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,840
this goes back to what i was saying

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,559
before like if you need to

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,960
leave a conversation if there's someone

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,799
that

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,440
for some reason makes you feel icky and

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,360
sticky and like ooh

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,799
don't waste time with that connection

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,799
even if it's the ceo

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,320
or some head or some vc firm or

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:32,799
something that might be useful for you

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,760
make sure you remove yourself from those

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,159
people

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,840
and make sure with a big note that it's

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,919
not people just because

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,880
of their race creed color all those

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,799
other things it's

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,320
because of something that you feel

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,120
philosophically have a big difference

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,120
with

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,640
the reason for that is because you don't

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,799
want to have a connection

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,919
just to have a connection this is for

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,440
people that you can

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,039
be yourself with and that you don't have

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,200
to hide that disgust

00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,799
so stay away from the online and make

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,720
sure you follow up these

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,559
connections are really great so make

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,399
sure you stay connected

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:08,240
and you continue this relationship

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,760
journey it doesn't stop there

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,760
and be fully seen with each other

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,120
