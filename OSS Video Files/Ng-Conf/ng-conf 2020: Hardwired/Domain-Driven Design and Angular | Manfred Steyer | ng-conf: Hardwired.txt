In this interactive session, we explore a case study on how to use proven domain-driven design principles to make the architecture of your Angular project maintainable in the long term. You also learn how to combine these ideas with best practices from the Angular community.

First, we define a strategic and tactical design for our case study, which we then implement with a monorepo that reflects our sub-domains. Then you learn in individual demonstrations how the use of libraries, APIs, facades, domain events, and access rules between libraries can ensure loose coupling and thus better maintainability.

In the end, you have a case study that you can use as a template for your projects.
