Angular and Firebase have been a great match since day one. That’s why AngularFire, the official Firebase library for Angular, is one of the most popular open source Angular libraries. Angular speeds up front end development and Firebase speeds up back end development. Together you can build awesome realtime UIs without ever needing to run your own server. This talk won’t be your run of the mill slide deck of features. You’ll learn how to get up and running with Firebase by watching the creator of AngularFire build an app. By the end of this talk you’ll know how to use Firebase to stream data in realtime, authenticate users, upload user content like images, run serverless code snippets, monitor app performance, and set up Google Analytics for Angular apps.
