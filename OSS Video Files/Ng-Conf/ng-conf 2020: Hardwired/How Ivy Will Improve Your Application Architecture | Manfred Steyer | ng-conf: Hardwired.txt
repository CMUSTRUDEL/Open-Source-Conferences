Ivy is primarily associated with smaller bundles and therefore better performance. However, Ivy has much more to offer, and many smart concepts provide the foundation for some much-anticipated future features.

Find out how Ivy’s potential can impact your future architecture. We use a case study to explore a possible future without NgModules, the use of dynamic components or higher-order components, zone-less change detection, and new possibilities for lazy loading and plug-in systems.

In the end, you understand Ivy’s potential and how to start preparing for it today.
