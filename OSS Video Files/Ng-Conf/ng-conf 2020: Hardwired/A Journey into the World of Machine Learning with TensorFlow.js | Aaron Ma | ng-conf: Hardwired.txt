This talk is the flagship machine learning with TensorFlow.js that delivers unique learning with immersive projects that stretches your mind. Weâ€™ll start by learning the basics and perfect your knowledge of Machine Learning and TensorFlow.js by building a digit classifier. Then, weâ€™ll develop our expertise in core TensorFlow.js concepts and Reinforcement Learning(RL) and develop a self-driving car that learns how to drive itself. Weâ€™ll finish off by adding a touch of the magic of neural networks to our Angular application by building an image classifier. (all demos made with ðŸ’– using Angular 9+)
