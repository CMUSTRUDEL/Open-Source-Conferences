[Applause]

00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:14,880
and jig girls just wanna have fun yeah

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,480
you're having fun here in ng-conf yeah

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,500
are you having fun with angular all

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,039
right

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:27,359
well for me this song is about being

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,130
bald and doing what you like even though

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,719
you know you don't have to think about

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,820
what other people think but sometimes we

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,210
don't know what we like just because we

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,550
haven't experienced it yet and this is

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,950
one of the problems we try to address in

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,360
integrals and you can help us with that

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:53,160
right so we all know there is a

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,579
diversity problem in the tech world the

00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:01,140
movie code debugging the gender gap

00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:03,449
gives a good background on this also Joe

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,860
Eames gave a really fascinating talk

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:12,720
about unconscious bias targeted both at

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:15,630
others and ourselves in ngnl let me tell

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,420
you how this bias has affected me and

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,780
how organizations promote promoting

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:28,470
women coders have emboldened and

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:32,400
inspired me for years I believed that

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:35,549
coding isn't for me my father and

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,430
brother are really good with it and they

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,670
never discouraged me on the contrary but

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:47,640
still having trouble understanding the

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:55,439
concept of pointers I felt like you know

00:01:47,640 --> 00:02:01,040
I'm too girly for this but instead guess

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,040
what I want I went to learn physics

00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:10,020
later on when I helped my boyfriend with

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,210
his homework in computer science he told

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,460
me that I'm really good at this and I

00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,320
should do something with my logical

00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,850
thinking and I should go study

00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:24,000
programming so that was a sign for me

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:27,840
to go in and or enroll for information

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,260
systems and this was also a sign for me

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,880
that my boyfriend's are keeper today

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:39,750
we're married so it is so important to

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,300
have a supporting environment that lifts

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:47,240
you up and opens your eyes to of world

00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:51,030
of possibilities during my studies I

00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:54,320
enjoyed the challenges which were not at

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:57,390
all frustrating as homework in physics

00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,000
when I did my homework I could see the

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,050
results right in front of my eyes on the

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,030
computer screen and I really loved it

00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:09,390
but still I thought what kind of a

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,880
career choice is this then I

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,850
participated in the very first jungle

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,060
girls event who has heard about jungle

00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,060
girls

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,690
jungle girls

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:25,080
organised workshops for women all around

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,870
the world in these workshops the

00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,420
participants follow a tutorial where

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,049
they build their own web application

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,880
with Django and with the help of mentors

00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:40,350
now even though I've already had some

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:43,590
experience coding this workshop and its

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:48,299
organizers really gave me motivation to

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:51,840
keep on and inspired me so inspired by

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:56,790
jungle girls just a few months ago and

00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:00,239
g-girls was born and the workshops have

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,299
the same concept the participants who

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:08,430
are women who have little or no

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:12,720
experience at all in programming they

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,710
follow a written tutorial in which they

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,440
build their

00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:20,490
a very first web application with

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:23,850
angular and the angular CLI and with the

00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:25,890
help of mentors of course so we had the

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,670
very first workshop in tel-aviv in

00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:32,190
November and it was a huge success

00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:35,730
the place was packed the mentors were

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:38,880
awesome and we've got really good

00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:42,570
feedback and expectations to keep on

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,850
doing events like this then we had

00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:48,690
another successful workshop in ng

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,880
Vikings in Copenhagen one of the mentors

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,890
there Robert

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,770
organised in ng girls workshop just two

00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:59,580
weeks ago as part of JSON cons in

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:01,230
Hamburg and we also have Erika in Brazil

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,490
who's doing workshops and other

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:08,220
activities with integrals

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:11,670
these pictures were taking just a few

00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:15,270
days ago here at ng-conf we had an mg

00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:18,240
girls workshop here and as you can see

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:21,760
it was really successful so a shout out

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:28,160
to the mentors and the participants

00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:30,750
[Applause]

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,850
we have many more plans to encourage

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,970
women to step into this world of

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:38,280
development and I hope then in time

00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,590
we'll be able to reach different types

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:46,620
of audiences from school girls to

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:48,450
grownups from from beginners who seek

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,780
the opportunity to learn something new

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:55,650
to more experienced developers who can

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,510
become role models now there are many

00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,850
other brilliant organizations that

00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,580
support women in tech like women

00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:05,090
techmakers and women who code and so on

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:09,450
we collaborate with these organizations

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:12,810
but we give the angular twist and color

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:15,000
is such a rich platform but yet it is so

00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:18,240
easy to start with and the angular

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,370
community is truly spectacular its

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:26,160
embracing nature is an essential part

00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:33,150
essential ingredient in this kind of

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:35,760
activities so how can you help you can

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,280
organize an ng girls workshop wherever

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,850
you are we will help you with resources

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,640
and you just have to organize the

00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:47,610
participants and mentors you can

00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,880
contribute the tutorial is open-source

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:53,729
and you can help us improving it and of

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,760
course we're always looking for sponsors

00:06:53,729 --> 00:07:00,660
both for ongoing events activities or

00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:04,500
for specific events and if you have any

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:09,000
other ideas really we'd love to hear so

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:12,180
come talk to me afterwards right so if

00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,610
you have fun with angular and you would

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,270
love to give back to the community

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:22,070
come join us with energy girls everyone

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,780
is welcome and there is so much to do

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:30,029
thank you

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:30,029
