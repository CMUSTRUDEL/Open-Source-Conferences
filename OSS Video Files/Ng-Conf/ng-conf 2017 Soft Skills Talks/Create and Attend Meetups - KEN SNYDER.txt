00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,780
company in downtown salt lake city

00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:15,630

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,650
from such utah jazz films as monthly

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:22,369
meetups and annual conferences I run the

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,340
monthly meetup for utah jaya and

00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:28,830
angularjs in Salt Lake City and shout

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,369
out for those who run Utah Jazz meetups

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,920
in lehi Ogden and Logan and those who

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:39,059
run these learners and those run

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,450
angularjs in lehi we've seen from

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:48,390
awesome presentations this week and the

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:50,399
next step is to continue learning let's

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:55,710
first talk about what makes it good meet

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:58,739
up first find an event host and stick

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,730
with it it could be a tech company a

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,830
college campus or co-working space if

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,630
you keep meetups at the same time and

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:11,220
location every month people can make a

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:13,710
habit of attending a lot of times event

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,810
hosts will provide dinner but if not

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:20,509
seek sponsors for dinner it could be

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:23,040
something simple like pizza or subs and

00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:24,630
there are a lot of companies that like

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,390
to give back to the community boost

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:32,210
their image or network with developers

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:35,369
ask around and try to get sponsors and

00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:38,820
what keeps people coming back is

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:41,060
interesting topics some people will tend

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,890
only a few times a year and that's okay

00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,530
try to cover a wide variety of topics

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:51,090
and make each month something

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:54,320
interesting meetup com is a great

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:58,710
platform to announce topics get RSVPs

00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,020
seek speakers and have discussions it

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,490
also gives your group a name and a

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:08,459
method to contact the organizers

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:10,920
beginners might like a faq faq that you

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,040
can link to on meetup and common

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,700
questions might be why angular 2

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,189
who is now angular 4 y-b CNG all over

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,769
the place what are all these things

00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:24,200
passes the constructor and what is this

00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:30,019
funky typescript syntax and what are

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:32,450
these app signs everywhere lecture style

00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:34,970
is great but try to have some hands-on

00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:40,400
presentations or tutorials every once in

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:43,219
a while if you run short on time ask for

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,470
impromptu presentations you can announce

00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:47,299
it this way does anyone have a mini

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,549
presentation something cool you've

00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:52,489
worked on something interesting you saw

00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,200
or a question you want answered you can

00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,590
come up to the front and plug in your

00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,180
computer or just talk from your seat

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,639
some of the best meetings I've had are

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:06,470
ones with discussions that have come out

00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:09,470
of lightning rounds if you end up with

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:12,739
no presenter have some simple backup

00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:16,579
ideas pick out some ng comp videos to

00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:19,780
watch bookmarked some good tutorials or

00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:19,780
blog posts that you can walk through

00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:26,659
three guides Kip Lawrence Nate pilling

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,419
and I started meeting about JavaScript

00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:31,669
in 2010 there was a lot of value with

00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:33,500
just us three we talked about what we

00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:37,760
were working on cool stuff we learned

00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,530
and watch Douglas Crockford videos more

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,720
people began to come and now we have

00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,069
multiple meetups every month and the sep

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:48,560
tember we're having our sixth annual

00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:51,319
conference you'll need a little help to

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,530
get started tweet about your meetup and

00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:56,870
ask people to retweet create a linkedin

00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,680
group and then add it to your profile

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,840
and update your linkedin status to find

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,180
the general web technology meet up or a

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,269
javascript meetup attend and asked the

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,819
organizers if you can plug your group

00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:15,290
ask colleges and dev boot camps to

00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:17,090
announce your meetups or post flyers now

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,889
let's talk about how you can get the

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,889
most out of the meetups that you attend

00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:31,539
so networking is more important than you

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,780
think it can pay off dick down the road

00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:36,400
try to move in people for example make a

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,759
goal to sit by someone you don't know

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,129
and introduce yourself and maybe make a

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,560
second goal to talk to another new

00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:47,080
person after the meetup if you're

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,050
looking for a job or hiring mention that

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,789
in your conversation if you don't

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,400
network you might be like this Dilbert

00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:56,439
candidate who focuses on his work but

00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,770
looks for the hiring manager that he is

00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:05,020
dead and go prepared to learn something

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:07,300
take some effort to listen to the

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:12,210
presenter or go through tutorials with

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:14,430
them and no one likes a grumpy cat

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:18,669
participate start off by asking

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,919
questions volunteer to present even a

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:23,680
short presentation is great I mean if

00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,419
you want to learn something do volunteer

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,009
to present it in your vault you know

00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:33,699
force yourself to learn so get on it you

00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:36,610
can find up a meet up near you on meetup

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:40,360
com or often searching on Google is

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:42,699
easier these are just a few of the

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:49,690
meetups I think was that in the first

00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:52,210
session there is 727 so let us end with

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:55,270
a little cheering contest here we're

00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,710
going to cheer by location so first if

00:05:55,270 --> 00:06:02,710
you attend an angular meet up outside

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:05,339
the US give a cheer right on and if you

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:12,250
are in the US east of the Mississippi

00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:17,080
cheer and if you go to a meet up on the

00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:19,270
west of the Mississippi cheer oh that I

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:24,089
think that was pretty good and if you

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,089
meet on a boat on the Mississippi cheer

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,259
thank you very much

00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,259
