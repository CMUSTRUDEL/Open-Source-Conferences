chat today we're gonna talk about the

00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:47,380
day I met Steve so I've been in the

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:50,650
industry for about five years not all of

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,820
that was developing full-time um but

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,690
I've been in the industry for about five

00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:59,340
years and you might call it blessed or

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:03,430
you know being super naive but up until

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:08,340
this past year I had this idea that all

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:10,900
developers care like they actually care

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,730
whether it's about the code they're

00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,920
writing on the day-to-day whether it's

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,590
about the client the user the customer

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,620
that they're trying to help I really did

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:24,150
believe until the day I met Steve that

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,040
they all cared so I was on the way to

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,739
movies to see a movie don't remember

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,560
which one I go to a ton and I was gonna

00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:35,170
meet my friend and you know how work is

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,819
he's a developer - he was running late

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,230
and he's like oh I just have five more

00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:39,850
minutes I got to get this PR written

00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,889
right so I'm like yeah yeah yeah

00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,109
so I come into his work I'm sitting in

00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:47,140
his office hanging out while he's

00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:49,239
working and Steve is you know an

00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,890
employee in his office and Steve sitting

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,230
over there chugging away and Sally

00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:57,440
comes in it's like hey Steve see if I

00:03:54,230 --> 00:04:01,819
have a request from you can we please

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,560
use special characters and I'm like like

00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:04,970
my ears perk up cuz I'm like what like

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,709
you know I've been a developer for four

00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,540
years now and I'm like special

00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:11,209
characters she's like you know that

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,840
input field that we use every single day

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:18,799
I really like to use special characters

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,090
in it input field Steve goes but you're

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,610
not allowed to use special characters in

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,650
that input field and I'm like at this

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,480
point like like actually physically

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,700
turning to look at these people in this

00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,380
bizarre conversation and she's like no

00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,740
no no please like you know just inches

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,150
periods quote seems like this like easy

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,400
no no no but you're not allowed to use

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,340
special characters in that input field

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,370
and I'm like what the fudge who is that

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:48,560
who makes these rules he goes just type

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:50,300
out inches just just and she's like but

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,370
if I could just use the special

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,300
characters it would make my life and

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,380
everyone's life here so much easier and

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,070
here's a quote that I don't think I will

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,630
forget for as long as I'm a developer I

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:08,600
don't make the rules I just write the

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:10,729
code at this point my friend knows that

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,530
I'm like gawking at this conversation

00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:14,660
and he kind of like peers over his

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:19,669
laptop at me and he's like quite close

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:21,290
your mouth stop staring right I don't

00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:23,900
make the rules in my mind we're

00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,210
developers we can do anything we can be

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,190
anything we can write anything even if

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:32,270
that means giving Sally special

00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:34,430
characters in her input field so yeah

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,110
this is definitely my face right like

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,650
behind the conversation as you zoom in

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,960
I'm just like wow so I want to talk to

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:44,289
you guys a little bit about like my

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,370
Steve he's over there typing he's

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:49,940
studiously working not making special

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:52,910
characters happy characteristics of

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,590
Steve and I I'd like to identify these

00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,310
not just so that we can point and laugh

00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,990
and say huh

00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:01,300
you're a Steve but so that we can maybe

00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:03,740
identify these in ourselves right so old

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,550
what do I mean by old I definitely don't

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,169
mean age

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,500
I don't mean time that you've been on

00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:13,460
this blest earth I mean old mentally

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:16,639
like up here if you think about older

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,490
people in like a mental situation for

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,139
instance I'm kind of an older mental

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,509
person at times I can be like I don't

00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:25,370
want it that way I want it the way that

00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:28,220
I always have had it right you're set in

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,690
your ways you're kind of stubborn but

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,150
when we think about that there's also a

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,129
lot of other things that come up when

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,419
you think of characteristics of Steve so

00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:36,680
I want to ask you right now while you're

00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:39,229
looking at these characteristics have

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,720
any of you ever met you have to say like

00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:43,849
it's me I'm Steve like don't say that

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,650
please but have any of you ever met or

00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:51,169
come across as Steve in this industry

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:55,699
okay one two oh four people yeah I was

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:58,789
like oh no I'm the only one were grumpy

00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:01,460
difficult ill-tempered just kind of it's

00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:04,789
difficult to work with right I love this

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,800
one jaded right where you're like

00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:08,960
looking at the code you're looking at

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,240
the feature you're looking at the input

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,710
field but none of your co-workers can

00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,840
use special characters in and you're

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:20,719
like this seems fine

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:22,539
great how does this happen you all how

00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:25,250
does how do we get to this point

00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:27,469
furthermore why does it happen these are

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,969
all questions that as soon as I left

00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:32,330
that conversation I started asking

00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:34,669
myself and I've studied up and you know

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,380
watch some other TED Talks and things

00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:39,590
like that and really like dug down into

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,900
this issue and things like not enough

00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,819
resources come up right to get your job

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,639
done whether it's time money other

00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,250
people to lean on and help you your boss

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,750
or others take credit for your work

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:57,500
that's a big one that gets mentioned a

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:59,870
lot and lack of autonomy so obviously

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,130
none of us at least unless we own our

00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,830
own company and then you can be like I

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,990
do what I want right none of us can do

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,340
exactly what we want to do the way that

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,930
we want to do it we have to answer to

00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,090
someone at the end of the day but when I

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,430
say the lack of autonomy or the lack of

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,320
control it's to the point where you

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,600
don't have any ownership or say-so

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,520
in any of the features you write in

00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,730
any way that you write it right like you

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,000
you you literally are helpless you just

00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:29,420
are like typing it out getting it done

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,270
so there's many many more but out of all

00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,460
of these none of them are like a deal

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,990
breaker right none of them are in my

00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,229
mind at least something that would push

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:43,250
someone over the edge to a place of just

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:44,990
not caring just apathy right so I'm

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,790
still asking this question at this point

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,290
during my research and asking friends

00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,870
like okay well how do we get from this

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:55,310
to Steve because I don't want to be

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:57,950
Steve I so desperately do not want to be

00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,530
Steve so how does it happen so that I

00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:03,160
can avoid that something that I learned

00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:07,420
recently is that these small things

00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:10,940
these frustrations if given enough time

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,260
they can turn to anger you don't have to

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,240
show hands but I would absolutely love

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,980
it have any of you ever worked not

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,080
necessarily in this field but in any

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:21,220
field and gotten to a point where these

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,410
tiny frustrations maybe lead to anger

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,360
anybody yeah you got a couple oh yeah

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:29,240
thank you yeah meets you oh I've been

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,780
there I've been angry well did you know

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,840
that if you give it enough time in the

00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:39,560
right circumstances anger can turn to

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:42,170
apathy no anybody know what apathy is

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,300
that one was like it's like a word that

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:47,350
lots of people use but does anybody have

00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,660
like a really good definition for apathy

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:53,870
just don't care yeah this is my abstract

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,040
apathy girl I was like redrawing her

00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,530
last night notes like do you like this

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,050
one she's like abstract and blocky my

00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:03,160
husband was like yes ship it it's

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:07,940
perfect so she's my abstract apathy girl

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:13,600
but given enough time apathy and gets to

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:20,030
turn into full-blown ugly nasty burnout

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:23,540
right so there's a doctor her name is

00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:27,860
dr. Gerry poo you they said that on but

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,930
dr. Gerry Pouliot and she did a study on

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,660
burnout and burnout patients and she

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,850
actually had a ton of participants and I

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,510
love this quote from her of burnout

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:41,060
workers feel like a cog in a machine

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:43,790
you're not human anymore and nobody

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:46,280
cares right and that's the part that

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,020
gets me I can understand the part where

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,180
you're a cog in a machine you're

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,760
churning out code at the end of the day

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,110
you just don't feel human anymore you

00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,339
don't have autonomy you don't get to

00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:58,240
make decisions you don't have pride in

00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:05,060
your work but that part gets me so much

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:07,760
nobody cares so in her study something

00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:10,460
really shocking because I actually have

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,470
a degree in psychology and right before

00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,420
I jumped into this industry I was going

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,610
for clinical studies and so I have kind

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,920
of a psych background and so when I was

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,600
studying this I was really interested

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,510
that there was actually it's not just a

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,040
mental you're like roadblock there are

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,660
actual physical things that happen to

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,370
your body when you're going through

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,690
burnout which is quite astonishing to me

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:34,820
so not just fatigue but sheer exhaustion

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,830
where you just are like you know and I

00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,990
can see that it's starting to paint a

00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,550
picture that makes sense to me if you're

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,220
just literally at the brink of

00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,600
exhaustion and collapse of course you

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,240
don't care if sally has special

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:52,460
characters right you have nothing more

00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:54,070
to give irritability you know grumpy the

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:59,270
inability to concentrate

00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:01,160
complete tasks and this last one chronic

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:05,089
acute disease I think this was the most

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,970
shocking of all so in her study she had

00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:09,980
I don't even know how many burnout like

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,080
patients she was studying and working

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,380
with and consulting with but she said

00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:18,560
that 10% of burnout patients and after

00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:22,450
leaving the organization right after

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,839
getting out of that toxic environment

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,839
developed cancer

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:33,200
I was like wait what great like the

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,670
effects on my body for burnout are

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,680
immeasurable and we still don't know

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,300
this isn't a direct correlation you

00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,470
can't say oh you have burnout you're

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,300
probably going to get cancer like

00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,640
there's no way to say that with most

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,200
psyche studies but it is a collection of

00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,390
data that we can look back on and

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,760
reflect on and say maybe being burned

00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:51,310
out your entire career isn't the best

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,240
choice for your physical well-being

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:59,210
right like we can say that assuredly so

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,680
I told you about the day I met Steve but

00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,260
I want to tell you about the night I met

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,760
Becca and this one actually made me the

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,380
first time I told it 1/3 tearing up I

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:11,780
was like no crime snap out of it but I

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,310
met Becca and it was at a meet-up and we

00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:15,680
went to get drinks afterwards and she

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,780
started telling me her story and I think

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,730
the most alarming thing because you know

00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,920
I've said it before to friends or family

00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:25,510
or whatever like yeah just like I'm just

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:29,900
so numb you know but like she said it

00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:32,180
with such an assurance sense like there

00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:35,810
was no emotion on her face there was

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,580
nothing there she was actually numb

00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,020
right so when she was saying these

00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,710
depressing things to me and telling me

00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:44,660
her story as a developer and it was just

00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,800
the facial expressions or I guess the

00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,260
lack thereof

00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,870
was the most startling thing for me and

00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:54,680
she said I just can't care anymore I'm

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,780
told in my job what to write exactly how

00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,070
to write it and if I don't if I kind of

00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,450
you know want to be creative about it I

00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,680
want to solve it in a different way if I

00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,990
want to use something different maybe

00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,450
this time then my pull request is

00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:08,300
rejected and I'm told to go back and do

00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:11,450
it again I am literally a glorified

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:15,080
typewriter again try to imagine this

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:17,660
coming from a girl who had no emotions

00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,410
on her face or in her voice there was

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,410
nothing there

00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:31,420
it really struck me as I was listening

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:35,040
to her story how like related and yet

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:39,400
how different Becca was from Steve and

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:42,940
how if we're all really honest Becca is

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:46,560
on the way to being a Steve right so

00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:52,330
these these things for me personally

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,950
they are they hit me hard because going

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,810
from psychology into this industry it

00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:59,500
was really exciting because I got to

00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:01,810
solve things right for like a developer

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,310
like what is it called where you're like

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,050
you've got the spyglass the Sherlock

00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,040
Holmes thing but I feel like that in

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,890
development where I'm like all right

00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,840
worse where's that bug right so for me

00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,250
when I first started meeting this last

00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,590
year these kind of people in the

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,470
industry I was just like wait what like

00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:19,210
you're not excited about this you're not

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,930
you know you're not passionate about

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:26,080
this and it got to a point with Steve

00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:28,510
especially that he was actively harming

00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,850
the people that he had set out to help

00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:34,060
by becoming a developer in the first

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:36,370
place and so besides the fact that we

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,560
have some evidence that points to hey

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,000
it's not the best for your physical

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,710
well-being to be burned out throughout

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,390
your career right we know that now it's

00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,400
not the best for you mentally obviously

00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,020
if you're irritable all the time I'm

00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,850
gonna think it's not the best for your

00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,650
friends around you right so we've got

00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,450
this like negative environment but you

00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,580
go even further outside of that bubble

00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,650
and you look at the people who we are

00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,600
here like it's almost like our New York

00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,970
doctors oath our developers oath right

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,510
they were sworn to help and protect them

00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:07,810
and they're harming them what can we do

00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,810
I we I think we're all in agreement here

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:12,460
that this isn't optimal right we don't

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:18,130
burnout is not the best way to live your

00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:19,960
career life so personally and again been

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:21,340
in this industry for four to five years

00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,560
so I'm just gonna tell you what I know

00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,510
and what I found and I'd love afterwards

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,950
if we could have a conversation and I

00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,210
could glean more from you all because I

00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,160
know our collective knowledge

00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,470
significantly more than I have so far

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,710
but what I have to offer you standing

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:38,290
here

00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:42,040
today is scuba diving it's to not have

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:44,110
all of your eggs in one basket right so

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,130
as human beings as people we have

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:50,800
interests and as ELISA I have found it's

00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:54,310
really difficult to not pour my entire

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,770
self into one thing I just I don't know

00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,390
what it is about my personality and I've

00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,280
met other developers like me so maybe

00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,980
it's like a you know as developers we

00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,780
have this trait but we get so into

00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,860
something right whether it's angular or

00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,959
whether it's just this feature we're

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,120
working on this project that literally

00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,130
our entire life it seems like for the

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,050
next 48 hours for the next week for the

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,930
next month for the next year goes into

00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:18,790
that one thing and what happens when

00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,320
that one thing goes downhill what

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:22,060
happens when that pull request isn't

00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:26,770
accepted what happens when you do

00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:28,750
everything right and nobody cares well

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,850
where's your self-esteem where is your

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,580
sense of self where is Alyssa at that

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:35,380
point well in a great place so one of

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,840
the things I can offer to you is to have

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,090
other interests that you yourself for me

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,210
it's scuba diving but you yourself can

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:46,540
be as passionate about as I hope you are

00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:48,760
for development something else anything

00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,140
else one of my good friends such an

00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,220
inspiration to me she actually taught me

00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:55,900
angular she loves to knit great with

00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,460
knitting hey it doesn't have to be

00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,170
expensive it doesn't have to be

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,310
time-consuming but you have to have

00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,480
something else that you can get

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,940
passionate about that you can maybe even

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,820
enter in a different community just so

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:10,330
that not all of your self-esteem is

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:14,290
wrapped up in one thing and the last

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:15,940
note that I want to leave you with is do

00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:19,780
you remember how you got here

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,850
not today in Salt Lake City took a train

00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,470
by the way from the airport but do you

00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:28,630
remember how you got here into

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:31,180
development I do I was in a career that

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:33,610
I felt hopeless in and I was following

00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:36,190
the motions and I had my husband and my

00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,900
friends who were all developers and I

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,040
started teaching me I said what are you

00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,680
doing I'm writing rails

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,060
what's rails what are you doing oh yeah

00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,890
I just like built this database and

00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,250
making API calls and I'm like okay well

00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,170
none of those words just made sense you

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,150
slow your roll right and I'd make him

00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,800
teach me and that's how I got in this

00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,420
industry that's how I got here because

00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,790
I'm a curious insane monkey that wants

00:18:53,420 --> 00:19:00,620
to take things apart right so think back

00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:04,570
how did you get here what passion once

00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:07,520
burned in you I mentioned it earlier but

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:11,540
to give you a reference my passion was

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,760
like being a code detective being able

00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,740
to go through things and like I still

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,080
get this way I get a bug and I'm like

00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,720
ooh what's causing it who is it coming

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,580
from and I know it's weird and and my my

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,100
my co-workers haven't gotten used to it

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,690
I hope but I'm like whew let's do it

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,810
right like and that's how I attack

00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:34,040
development that's how I attack my day

00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:36,740
but ask yourself what is your most

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:43,970
meaningful reason for being a developer

00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:46,550
right if you can center yourself with

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:49,240
that most meaningful reason if you can

00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:53,210
go back to that it's going to give you

00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:55,580
more than just the ability to solve

00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:58,310
problems and push out code it's going to

00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,800
give you a center that in this console

00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:02,630
like conscious continually changing

00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,520
industry that we have things thrown at

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,010
us that we have disappointments that we

00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,180
have you know just maybe shaded

00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,130
co-workers that we have to deal with

00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,860
it's going to give you something to come

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,200
back to and focus on and kind of

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,520
redirect that energy right you don't

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,210
have to be crushed by the world around

00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:23,530
you so that is my talk today thank you

00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,530
so much for being here

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,780
