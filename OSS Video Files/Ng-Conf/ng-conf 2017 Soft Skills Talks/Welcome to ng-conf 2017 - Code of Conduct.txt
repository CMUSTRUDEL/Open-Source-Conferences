and it's just like Keita Cinda this is

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,110
exactly how brilliant the angular

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,659

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,720
gonna talk about something really

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,180
important that we needed to focus on for

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,920
the next three days so I'm gonna use

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,530

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,619
about something that affects all of us

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,350
so I need everyone to pay attention for

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,729
the next few minutes so no matter where

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,390
I go

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,909
I've always felt special whether I'm at

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,490
an event in London in Amsterdam in

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,340
Mexico City or whether I'm here at

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,110
ng-conf the community has always been a

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,509
fantastic community and they've always

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,850
shown me great and for the last four

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,280
years I've been honored to be a part of

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,570
it

00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,270
and one of my favorite parts every year

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,600
is getting together with you guys with

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,619
friends and with our angular family cuz

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,570
that's what we are coordinating their

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,439
family and I speak for myself and my

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,090
co-organizers when I say thank you to

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,860
the people here to the people on the

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,670
livestream for really making

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,929
ng-conf what it is it takes a lot of

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,110
effort we put a lot of effort into

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,920
planning this event and we're really

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,209
proud of

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,700
of what we've done this year's gonna be

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:22,550
perfect we're not gonna have any Wi-Fi

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:25,650
problems and no one's gonna get the flu

00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:27,720
so it's gonna be awesome

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,550
each year the this show gets bigger and

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,110
we try and add to it we try to make it

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,580
more interesting for the attendees it

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,850
certainly makes it more interesting for

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,440
us and this year we've we focused on

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,769
something that's really important to us

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,019
we focus on our code of conduct and

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:45,120
there's a lot of talk about when we talk

00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,050
about our code of conduct and you're

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,030
gonna hear a lot about it over the next

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,330
few days you're gonna hear in between

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,220
the talks you can hear from us the MCS

00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,600
and you're gonna see all the reminders

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,450
in the halls we hope you've seen him and

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,670
appreciated him there reminders that

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,330
each of us plays a really important role

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:06,810
in the angular community and I wanted to

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,160
find what a code of conduct is for me it

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,319
was the term that popped up of years ago

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,209
but now it's a term that it's really

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,640
important to me so when an organization

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:18,450
gets to a point where they decide to

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,130
formalize the acceptable and

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,470
unacceptable ways that they're allowed

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,780
to treat each other that formal

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,310
description of their behavior what's

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,489
acceptable in that community or that

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,079
organization is called a code of conduct

00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,540
and each organization that creates a

00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,010
code of conduct can either adopt one

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,500
that's existing or they can create their

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:41,970
own in an ng-conf we've traded our own

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,260
which is a compilation of the great code

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,120
of conduct that we saw as we looked

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,579
around the internet and we've also

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,920
tailored a little little bit for for our

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,750
needs for our community and if you want

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,299
to read the code of conduct and we need

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,910
everyone to it's on our website and it's

00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,920
also on the App the ng-conf app in the

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,069
App Store and the Play Store it's also

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,000
printed up in the halls and it's

00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:05,190
important I want to read it because

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,940
everyone here is expected to abide by it

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,940
so the speakers the attendees the

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,530
sponsors the organizers this year we

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,450
even brought in our vendors asked them

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,190
to read it and to agree to it it means

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,380
all of our entertainment all of our food

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,600
vendors our security team and the rest

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,159
of the vendor staff is abiding and

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,800
expected to abide by this code of

00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:28,740
conduct

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,350
so why did we have it up and this is

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,199
this is where I have to be frank and

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,750
we're not starting off too great this

00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:40,139
year we had some code of conduct

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:44,550
violations in the past and and it was

00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:47,280
tough and some of the people that were

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,479
here in the past aren't here today and I

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,020
want to talk about two types of those

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,970
people

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:55,319
one type is people who have been

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:58,229
explicitly uninvited from participating

00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,410
in ng-conf events and the other type is

00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:04,259
people who didn't feel welcomed and

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,820
didn't feel comfortable here with us and

00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:09,330
that's got to stop that's something that

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:11,099
we mean to change everyone here plays a

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,259
role in that and we invite everyone to

00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:14,699
participate with us and over the next

00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,070
few days if you see anything

00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:19,680
the violates the code of conduct we

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:22,409
invite you do to with us roll up your

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,120
sleeves and get involved we've we've

00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:27,000
made three ways to report a code of

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,320
conduct violation the first way is to

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,889
find one of the friendly conference

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,320
staff

00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:33,960
so that's anyone in anything one of the

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,539
organizers or anyone in the red ng help

00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,400
t-shirts we all know exactly what to do

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,870
if anyone approaches this and says I

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,969
need to report a code of conduct

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,190
violation we'll take you to a place

00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:46,110
that's safe for we've set it apart and

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,469
we can talk about what you saw and we

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,610
can begin to resolve the problem

00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:52,229
the second way because we know some

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,280
people want more anonymity and have a

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:55,770
hard time talking about it is through

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,740
email so if you email us at info ng-conf

00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,169
dot org and explain to us that you're

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,990
reporting a violation we ask that you

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:07,500
provide as much information as you're

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:10,740
comfortably providing to let us know how

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:14,870
we can can to help us fix the problem

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:19,050
and the last way is by : the ng-conf

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:21,449
code of conduct hotline if if anything's

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,460
urgent or after hours this is a great

00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:26,659
way to get a hold of us to help you out

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,659
in a moment that you might need it

00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,299
once you've reported a code of conduct

00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:34,629
violation we've established a team a

00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:37,779
committee that's prepared to make a

00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:39,459
decision on what we do next we wanted

00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:41,559
everyone to be fairly represented in

00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:45,189
this code of conduct committee it's made

00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:48,489
up of speakers attendees sponsors and

00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:51,759
the organizing team as well we want this

00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:52,899
team to jump in and make decisions in

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,849
the case that there's a code of conduct

00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:58,449
violation and they're currently ready to

00:06:54,849 --> 00:07:00,609
do so if you want to send more about the

00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:02,169
code of conduct committee if you go to

00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:03,639
the code of conduct on page two we

00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:07,749
explain the process that they go through

00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:11,079
in making these decisions ng-conf team

00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:13,629
we want everyone to feel welcome we ask

00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,879
that you participate with us and pay

00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:18,579
attention to the needs of one another if

00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,709
you see anyone that's alone or perhaps

00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:23,919
struggling we ask you to get involved

00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:28,809
and play your role an active role in the

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:30,189
community ng-conf we want it to be a

00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:33,189
place where everyone can feel welcome

00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:35,289
