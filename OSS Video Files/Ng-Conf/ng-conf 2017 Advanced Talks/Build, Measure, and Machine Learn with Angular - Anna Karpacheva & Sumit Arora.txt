can you guys see me okay cool so we're

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,740
very pleased to be here and thank you

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,500
for coming and I see we have some woman

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,260
in the room so that's great so we're

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,570
here to present the talk on the bill

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,279
measure machine learning with angular

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:25,890
we are from Rango and at Rango we create

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,599
web mobile apps that move as fast as

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:34,079
your business so I'm Anna I work mainly

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,000
as a business quality analyst as well as

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,460
the analytic consultant and sometimes a

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,460
scrum master and I'm very passionate

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,340
about data visualizations and also

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,379
business making a business sense I go to

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,520
a lot of big data meetups and follow the

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,500
technology prior to wrangle I was at big

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,360
data project in one of the banks in

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,100
Toronto and prior to that I was a member

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,770
of the business intelligence simply an

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,960
Oracle and sherry sumit so hello

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,780
everyone I'm submit I'm a software

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,590
developer Grendel working in angular and

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,180
most currently in angular CLI so when

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,030
I'm not working on angular which is

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,970
really a case I am very passionate about

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,880
machine learning and all ecosystem so I

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,369
play around the machine learning using

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,110
spark and Scala awesome

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,850
so zoomit wanted to be here on the

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,920
podium and I want to feel like I want to

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,430
be close to you guys so I'm just going

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,579
to stay here to support him so the way

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,380
so the reason represented this talk is

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,810
the following so we are in a web

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,640
development domain here and we create

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,220
all of this websites of a lot of pages

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,220
and navigation so imagine if you know

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,860
your customers imagine if you can find a

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,479
way to to figure out where they're

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,939
coming from whether they attention

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,280
so by knowing to customers you're going

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,130
to get more organic conversions rather

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,259
than P conversions and then imagine you

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,090
can easily capture your analytics and

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,100
also switch the analytic tools from one

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,369
to another and also automate the

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,250
processes so all leading to creating

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:11,370
more business value and saving the time

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,350
so our talk is a bit loaded so I'm going

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,550
to prep you for that so be ready so

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,780
the way how we're going to do it we're

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,820
going to talk about build measure learn

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,590
then assume it is going to talk about

00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,290
symbols tracking of the open source

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,570
reduction library then I'll go to a/b

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,480
testing and personalizations and why

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,070
then assume it moves to the machine

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,110
learning and at the ants are going to

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,610
show you the resource page with all of

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,620
the gif hops and all of the links that

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:38,010
you can take the picture and do whatever

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:41,730
you want to do so build measure learn so

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,160
who knows about build measure learn no

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,520
hands no hands no hands good boy

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,850
oh one good so or two good okay regular

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,600
it doesn't count so build my film as you

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,670
learn so we are building features right

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,250
so we're building features and then what

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,560
we want to do we want to measure the

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,870
features for example we get the visitors

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,730
and we want to see what visitors do and

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,820
if they like the features or not right

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,470
so then we'll go to the learn and we'll

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,630
learn about our customers we'll learn

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,640
about the visitors so what we do next

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:17,250
we'll go to the next cycle and we'll

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,080
build back better features right if you

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,300
can compare it like a recipe when you

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,160
cook something you have a recipe

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,780
sometimes you don't have a recipe you

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,430
got the bad foods you don't know what

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,430
happened you didn't measure it properly

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,800
right so that's the simple analogy and

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,900
in order to show you what we did we do

00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,120
the prototype of the website so what

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,160
what suma did she created the app and

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,500
we're going to show you the demo so

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,510
right now in the black boxes you see the

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,480
replication of the web pages of the

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,490
Wrangell website so any user can go and

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,640
navigate for the pages so services

00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:53,520
process work resources tag stack and

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,440
block and on this pages the users are

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,780
going to be presented with the buttons

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,390
in that so we call them call to action

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,230
so what can they do so they can contact

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:06,690
us wrangle office they can request an

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:09,420
office training or they can sign out for

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,520
online training so what we want to do we

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,470
want to find out what these users are

00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,330
where they're coming from and then we

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,549
want to predict what they're going to

00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,320
choose out of this free call to action

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,229
buttons and we're going to show them

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,270
right at the first page or as soon as

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,740
possible so it's saving their time they

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,330
don't have to navigate for all of this

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,050
page

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:32,569
and find out what they're looking for so

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,009
now here is actually the demo page where

00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:36,740
they're going to show you later and you

00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:39,440
can see the underlined links in red so

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,659
these are the pages in red and for

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,849
example you select the process and you

00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:46,009
present presented to the most likely

00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:48,169
chosen contact us and call to action

00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:50,509
bottom and now soon which is going to

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:52,699
show you how to use the redirect beacon

00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:55,669
library to collect the data thanks Anna

00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:58,220
so the most important part of any data

00:04:55,669 --> 00:05:00,319
analysis is to how do I capture that at

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,560
out whether it's clicks immense

00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,020
pageviews navigation or anything else so

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,509
we do so in an angular app using a real

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,240
touch open source library named redux

00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:14,270
beacon we created a triangle what will

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,240
dux beacon does is it basically wiretaps

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:19,729
your duck sections and sends them to a

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,639
target of your choice whether it's

00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:25,430
Google Analytics Google tag manager or

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,430
anything else for conversion and

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,469
reporting purposes now how many of you

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:35,150
know what the conversion means raise

00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:37,099
your hand okay couple of ones okay so

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:39,919
for those who don't know conversion

00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:41,960
simply means converting users or making

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,340
the users do what you want them to do

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,080
whether it's downloading an e-book or

00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,659
subscribing to a newsletter or anything

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,909
else so we have make converting our

00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:56,240
visitors to customers or the buyers

00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:59,569
itself and in the code over here you can

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,729
see I have redux be complicated it's we

00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:04,460
can target and set it to Google

00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:07,159
Analytics now it's just say what it will

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,789
do is as I navigate through the Redux

00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:13,430
action it will send it will target that

00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:15,199
are to my Google Analytics endpoint so

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,240
is an analyst summit I will have a

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,129
question right so now you're presenting

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,919
us you can send the date as a target to

00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:24,770
GA count what if I want to use something

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,569
else can I change it absolutely so what

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,840
it ducks beacon allows you to do is

00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:30,740
basically you can we have a couple of in

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,719
build targets

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,370
it's for Google Analytics Google tag

00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:37,810
manager

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:39,910
or segments IOR and that's it but so you

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,979
can also create your own custom targets

00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:46,990
which we'll do later for the demo itself

00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:48,729
and checked it to yourself so sometimes

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,090
just gathering the data is simply not

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:53,800
enough we may want to do we want to

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,020
display a different version of a page to

00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,220
different users and see which one has

00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:00,070
better conversion

00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:03,130
this is called a be testing we do so by

00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:05,260
using angular directive in the code over

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,180
here you can see I'm just displaying the

00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,430
button if the feature is enabled a

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,220
feature is not enabled I don't even

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,860
bother showing the button to the user at

00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:17,050
all now how many of you have used

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,870
feature toggles or actively using

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,300
feature toggles in your project okay

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,789
that's great yeah so for those who don't

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:28,120
know just consider them as if statements

00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:30,729
we display the content if a feature is

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,740
enabled if the feature is not enabled we

00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:35,320
don't even bother showing the content to

00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:38,530
the user at all and they are used for

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:41,050
various reasons right releasing Cannery

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:45,130
features to the users or merging peers

00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:47,349
or anything else and I see that you put

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,960
the feature toggles in line the codes is

00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:52,180
it always the way to go no it's not that

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,430
like you can use some cloud services

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,560
like launch jockey or optimize little do

00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,169
the feature toggles but for now we will

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,479
only consider it on a be testing awesome

00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:03,880
thanks so much so let's talk about a/b

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:07,590
testing so let's say we are running the

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:10,810
experiment and we want to present our

00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,669
visitors so 50% like let's say we have a

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,660
room so 50% gonna be presented with

00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:15,940
banner AE

00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,400
which is the orange color or red here

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,970
and the 50% are going to be presented

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,220
with the banner be the green color and

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,020
then when we run the experiment over

00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,729
time we're going to see the results so

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,740
we're going to do the measuring for it

00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:31,150
and we're going to learn all right so

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:35,140
what we'll learn after the rynek

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:39,250
experiment that we have 23% over 11%

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:41,589
meaning that the banner a B banner a win

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,300
right so we got over the winner and we

00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,730
can do the attesting for different

00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,270
purposes we can check the features we

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,540
can check the colors the

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:52,790
DTA paragraphs and so on also as an

00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,890
analyst when I analyze the data so this

00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:58,060
is the example of running the experiment

00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:00,680
using the tool if you look at the right

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:04,070
bottom corner in the green you get the

00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:07,730
winner 99% but also what I want to know

00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:11,360
I want to know my confidence level

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:13,720
interval so I can say 95% confidence

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,700
that when I run experiment on the same

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,590
sample size I will get the same results

00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,630
what does it mean if I'll take a room

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,640
and approximate the same number of

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:26,090
people here is my visitors I'll get

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,310
banner be banner a as a winner so the

00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:31,010
problem with a be testing when they do

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:34,430
it when we do it we get the winner so we

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:36,140
get a over B but we don't know who are

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,940
these users we don't know where they're

00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,310
coming from we don't know the attention

00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,710
we are not connecting to them and that's

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:45,110
what we want to know as an analyst in

00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,850
the digital world right so what I'm

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,740
going to do I'm going to go to my Google

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,080
Analytics account and I'm going to start

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,300
running the reports landing pages by the

00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,190
locations just to try to understand my

00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,950
customers and that's called

00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,020
personalization so on this example in

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,510
the graphics the way how I want to show

00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,700
you guys so let's say if you are located

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:07,370
so we have an office and Wrangell right

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:10,460
so if you're located in Asia or in

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,800
Australia so you are in a far proximity

00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,290
from the office and Ringo right so which

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,920
is in Toronto in Canada so you're most

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:22,340
likely to click on online training or

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:25,430
contact us if you are located in Toronto

00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:28,160
or you tour somewhere in North America

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:31,370
you are in a closer proximity to the

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,760
office in in Toronto then you are most

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:37,070
likely to click on in office training to

00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,190
come to the office or contact us and

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,830
that's what we want to project and it's

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:46,190
an analyst what I will do I will start

00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:49,100
segmenting my visitors by locations by

00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:51,650
the data that I collect above them and

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,080
I'll start building the rules so I can

00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,180
build this prediction and then over time

00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,550
so I run my experiments and then over

00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,490
time I'm going to build this segments

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,380
again

00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,690
over the segment's and rule after rule

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,060
so I can get better predictions and see

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,520
the results but I'm not generating those

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,730
rules over and over like isn't that too

00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,560
much work to do well as I said I'm a

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,230
consultant at Ringo and then being

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:20,760
papered our so I don't mind so much okay

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:22,290
but I have a better idea so remember in

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,450
Redux beacon you can create your own

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:27,330
custom target so what I have done is

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,839
I've created a custom endpoint to sang

00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:33,089
my deluxe beacon target

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,860
let us beacon data to a custom endpoint

00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:38,040
and saving that data into the database

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:41,070
which I will use to train a predictive

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,470
order and do the predictions later so

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:46,020
over here you can see a summarized

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,180
session data for each user so we have

00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,520
seven independent variables basically

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,940
the pages the user visits and the

00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,440
country from via user is coming from and

00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,600
three dependent variables which are

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,180
dependent on those which are basically

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,060
our call to actions which we want our

00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,860
user to display so we will pass this

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,890
data to a machine learning algorithm

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:10,649
which will generate a model to best fit

00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:15,240
the data that it's trained upon and in

00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:17,100
this case it's the session data now but

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,290
the question is how does it know how

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,899
does it generate the model so for this

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,430
if you look at the diagram over here so

00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,730
you can see there is no correlation

00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:29,250
between the page one and a button user

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,010
clicks plug it's usually the case

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,959
because when I visit a user I am NOT

00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,480
when I visit a website I am NOT going to

00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:39,270
subscribe a website just by looking at

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,750
the first page I would probably navigate

00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:45,270
couple of pages and then subscribe after

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,579
knowing the up flowing more information

00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,110
about the website so over here you can

00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:52,320
see there is a strong correlation

00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:55,950
between the page two but there is no

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:59,130
correlation between the page one so what

00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:01,230
machine learning algorithm does is it it

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:03,930
takes these correlation it can be

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,029
hundred and thousands based on depending

00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:09,329
on the data you pass and generates the

00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:12,130
model which are you showing next so over

00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:14,560
here you can see the dist

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:17,440
create generated and you can see it

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,589
branches out on the features like pages

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,750
a user visits or country from here a

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:25,899
user is coming from a number and it

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:28,509
gives me the probability of a

00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:32,709
probability of each call to action a

00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:35,709
user would probably be clicking so the

00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:37,569
way so it's called the decision tree

00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:39,940
model what we see right now is the

00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:42,250
decision tree model and if we compare

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,880
decision tree model with neural networks

00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:49,360
they are similar and not so the neural

00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,190
networks they are represented by a lot

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,560
of mathematical formulas that will take

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:56,079
a lot of black boards to write and what

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,269
they do they sitting inside the machine

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,759
learning algorithms which predicts out

00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:03,670
of a multi-dimensional data the best

00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:05,529
result possible on the interface though

00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,990
the neural networks they're very close

00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:10,060
to decision trees and they look the same

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:13,449
so the way how it works it would be

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,850
input our independent variables and we

00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:18,699
want to predict the output our dependent

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,470
variables and what you show what you've

00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:25,380
done it's very cool so let's show the

00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,380
demo sure so let me show you the demo

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,449
I'm just reloading just to make sure

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:35,230
that everything works okay so this is

00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:38,139
the page as we showed earlier so at the

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,420
start I am just marking a user visiting

00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:45,009
from Asia and another one coming from

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:47,829
Canada and we have six six six links

00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,839
where a user can go and and in the end

00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:52,899
over here you can see the prediction of

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,689
each button getting clicked or

00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:57,579
displaying and over here you can see a

00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:59,889
button that like which has the highest

00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:04,420
probability now lets me start with a

00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:06,370
user that is coming from Asia so when a

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,259
user first time comes to our website we

00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,790
don't know anything about him like he

00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,819
just fills the page so we don't show

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:16,569
anything but as he starts navigating

00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:18,490
through pages now I can see he is

00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:21,309
navigating through services and process

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,889
pages which are like more business

00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:24,520
oriented pages so he might be a business

00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:28,300
person

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,860
we may want to do a business with us so

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,080
what I will do so

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:36,430
what machine learning algorithm tells me

00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:39,820
is that the probability of CDA 3 which

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,260
corresponds to the contact us button has

00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,230
the highest probability so I will

00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:48,520
display that but as soon as the user

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:50,860
starts navigating away from business

00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:54,880
pages to more technical side of things

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:57,970
like resources tech stack or our blog he

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,730
might be interested in learning our the

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:03,880
training that we provide so we show him

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:08,339
the online training button and in

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:10,899
similar manner if I and ok so also now

00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:13,570
keep in mind like I'm mocking a user

00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:15,310
coming from Asia so that's why I'm

00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,800
showing the online training button

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,430
because he might not be able to come to

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,709
Canada

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:23,649
and do the in-office training but what

00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:26,410
if a user who's in North America so let

00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:29,050
us walk the another user so if I click

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,089
the set mark in it now over here I am

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:34,390
walking a user from Canada and it's the

00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:36,399
same thing right on first we don't know

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:38,680
anything about the user lagging we don't

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,350
display anything but as it starts

00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,450
navigating through pages you can see

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:46,990
like again I'm walking a business user

00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:49,000
first so we solve it it has the highest

00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:52,390
probability and I show the contact us

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,690
page but as soon as he navigates away

00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:57,970
from non-technical to technical pages he

00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:01,029
might be interested in the training we

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:03,250
provide but remember like as user is in

00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:05,980
North America and he is able to come to

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:09,790
our offices so we show him the in-office

00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:11,770
training button and and all this under

00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:15,250
the hood is making use of the redux

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:18,610
beacon library that we created also let

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:25,750
me show you the net the events so as I

00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:26,319
navigate so every navigate between the

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:31,900
pages

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:34,960
it sends mine it sends the custom data

00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,200
to my custom endpoint which I have and

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:42,779
which returns me the probability

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,769
the button that user uses and that's it

00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:51,059
from demo

00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:53,879
sighs so so just to recap what we have

00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:56,940
done is basically we have saved the

00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:58,649
analytics data quit database degenerated

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,320
the converted into the machine learning

00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:04,679
format generated the model did the

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:08,009
prediction with the rules and shown the

00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,470
user what we want them to do and Ana we

00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:13,679
don't need you anymore ah what ya in

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:16,139
hell yeah like we M algorithms are doing

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,239
everything I don't need you oh god yeah

00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:21,059
I need me anymore

00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:22,649
well um wow that's quite shocking you

00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:27,059
come to you thing you know you're not

00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:29,549
needed anymore yes so on that I would

00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:31,499
say okay so you did what you did but you

00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:33,450
only did one model right

00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:36,090
so it's an analyst that would say let's

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,070
go back to our a/b testing and we'll get

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,100
another model in place so we can get a

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,200
second set of predictions and compare

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,499
and run the experiment so to get the

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,720
better predictions and I got shocked

00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:52,619
like he's so hard like I got goose bumps

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,559
Wow and also if we go back to our

00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:58,230
description we wanted to put developers

00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:00,200
out of the job not the analyst because

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,639
we're gonna analyze the data but

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,159
machines can analyze the data they can't

00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:07,109
write the code well neural networks

00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:09,600
right now they can do they can produce

00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:12,179
the images and the songs not the code

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,309
yet but still what would be the input

00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,759
and output in those scenarios oh that's

00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:16,980
easy

00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:21,149
so input let's say if you take the

00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,950
Machine and educated on the github is

00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:24,989
the research for all of the code that

00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,149
developers said you guys put there so

00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:30,419
your input would be the user stories and

00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:32,580
the output would be the code okay but

00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:36,600
still they can't write the goal right

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,429
okay let's go to the next slide so here

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,669
you can see the code written by the

00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:44,850
artificial intelligence it is garbage it

00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:47,210
doesn't work but it looks like it was it

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,910
looks like it was written

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:52,280
by by a programmer right in the future

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:55,250
it could be done and it was trained on

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,670
the C source code so theoretically in

00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:00,920
the future we're not going to need you

00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:02,900
so probably like it's time for me to get

00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,920
lessons from you and Fitz Nguyen

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:09,800
well we'll talk about that and that's

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,930
the end of our presentation guys and I

00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,060
hope we're going to stay in business and

00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,260
go don't need to look for another job so

00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,750
we're not going to be replaced by the

00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:20,450
machines in the future and for those of

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:23,120
you who are interested in the reduct

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,580
beacon library it's the open source so

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,190
take your time and take the pictures so

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,740
rain go put a lot of effort to make it

00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:32,660
available and we started collecting the

00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:36,020
analytics on our projects and do that in

00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,820
the future and for future it's all busts

00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:40,220
and directives so you can get that link

00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,320
as well so for someone who is into a/b

00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,120
test things and want to find out what

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,270
it's all about and segmentations you can

00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:50,270
get the tools Google Analytics optimized

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:52,520
Optimizely for the artificial

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,710
intelligent code supply so you can get

00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,490
to that link and see and read it's very

00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,060
interesting

00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:01,490
so they demo up that Suman build you can

00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:04,070
see it under machine learning demo app

00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,870
and also we posted the presentation

00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:08,540
slides for you so if you want to go over

00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:11,000
and remind yourself they are there and

00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,500
it was a pleasure thank you very much

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,920
for coming today listening and I hope

00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,920
you like

00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:18,090
