hello everyone my name is Dave Shanley

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,390
and I'm a UI architected VMware you

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,010
might remember me from last year but

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,179
probably haven't don't worry it's okay

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,509
I'm quite forgettable so who here has

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,820
actually heard of VMware any hands oh

00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:21,150
cool a lot more than I was expecting

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,250
who has heard of clarity well a couple

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,439
of hands very good or for those of you

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,900
don't know VMware is the market leader

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:33,360
in virtualization and private cloud and

00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,829
we don't just virtualized desktop PCs

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,500
and virtual machines to desktop we also

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,059
virtualized entire data centers and it's

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,000
not just virtual machines we also do

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,860
networking and storage as well VMware's

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,410
technology actually powered submarines

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,320
planes ships pretty much every single

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,559
fortune 100 company out there it's the

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,390
company that powers your bank and works

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,800
under the covers when you're shopping at

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,920
Home Depot we're like kind of the

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:07,670
invisible company and we're here today

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:10,830
to talk about clarity clarity is our

00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,330
design system but let's take a step back

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,220
actually explore I take a step back say

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,170
why is VMware here actually right so

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,820
what what the hell does VMware have to

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,970
deal with with angular well actually

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,909
quite a lot so I put our products are

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,830
really quite complicated and if we need

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,060
to build some really heavy-duty UI is to

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,130
allow our customers to interact with

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,020
these products and they go quite deep

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,689
and we've been acquiring more and more

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,270
horsepower over the years and we need a

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,280
solution for this so in order to meet

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,220
these demands we've been very heavily

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,840
investing in angular over the last 18

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,689
months we've completely moved to angular

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,799
2 angular for now and pretty much every

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,630
single UI that we build is angular based

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,360
so we have pretty much invested

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,920
everything we feel is is we want to go

00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,540
with the UI development in angular and

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,340
because we're investing so much we

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,350
needed to create a system that allowed

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,360
us to build all of these UI for these by

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,459
all of these different teams in a

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,650
consistent way so we created clarity

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:15,140
clarity is our angular 2 angular 4

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,220
opponent system it's an enterprise-grade

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:21,209
component system for the angular

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:23,909
platform so but it's a lot it's not just

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,950
components it's also UX design patterns

00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:28,650
modern desert design patterns as well as

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,519
a CSS framework and icons so we're

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,590
trying to create an open and friendly

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,109
open source project that allows everyone

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,810
to build UI is in a clean and consistent

00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:42,329
fashion in a manner so all of our UIs

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,799
now are based on top of clarity we're so

00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,750
confident as we said what I vote we've

00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:47,519
actually open sourced it so we have the

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,959
clarity team here today and if you're

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,480

the guys would love to come and help you

00:02:53,879 --> 00:03:00,359

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:03,239
and get you up and running with it so we

00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:04,409

00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:12,230

00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:12,230
one person two people two people great

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,609
