00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,469
been pretty epic and it gets better and

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,120
better every year I actually did notes

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,070
this time usually I wing it but I

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,390

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,160
I don't need to plug in here that's all

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,870
good so so first off I'd like to say

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,340
thanks to the ng-conf organizers for

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,770
putting on the best conference ever

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,780
period that I've seen the then in the

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,160
inclusivity and the mindfulness vibe

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,170
coming in here and seeing all those

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,489
posters it's been amazing I don't think

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,160
I've ever seen that done so well like I

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,930
got the whole feeling and vibe of the

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,660
conference walking in and just seeing

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,890
all the presentations and I'd also like

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,300
to say thanks to the angler team for

00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,530
being relentless about innovation and

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:09,060
doing the right thing for the future

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:11,549
I'm angular four is amazing so wrangle

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,790
started based upon my enthusiasm for

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,530
angular I had done a lot of JavaScript a

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,689
lot of jQuery and when I saw angular it

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,110
was just I was so excited I actually had

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,909
to start the company so this is my

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,360
fourth og comp the first was in January

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,650
2014 you know at that point angular was

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,479
just starting to take off I think the

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,329
real inflection point was December 2012

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,430
Wrangell started in May 2013 so just as

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,750
angular started taking off single page

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,460
applications were going to take over the

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,960
world and it's happened it's been pretty

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:46,970
amazing 2015 was was another amazing

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,369
year so angular 2 was being talked about

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:52,590
2014 we had a stack every quarter 2015 I

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,270
think we had a stack every month 2015

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,560
was insane from a technology disruption

00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:00,990
perspective it was quite remarkable so

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,280
in 2015 we started working on angular 2

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,810
already because we were so excited about

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,790
it we moved all our angular 1 training

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,770
over to typescript we tried to you know

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,080
build it a proper sort of angler to his

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,670
component model we started working on

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,400
augury the angular 2 dev tools

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,350
and igor kaminsky led both both of those

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,270
initiatives is here and yuri tech day of

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,209
our CTO is also here who guided us

00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,610
through all the changes for those years

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:26,709
in 2016 we went all in on angular 2 when

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,290
the beta came out we moved to training

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:32,650
we started projects right in the

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,150
beginning of 2016 and by the time

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,280
angular 2 was released we had already

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,080
done over 20 angular 2 projects and we

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,420
were 50 percent angular 2 by the middle

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,950
of 2016 and we did a bunch of native

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,290
script projects as well with angular 2

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:48,459
and angular 2 is proving to be amazing

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:51,660
for mobile as well so for 2017 you know

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:54,880
what is 2017 ring it's a super exciting

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,680
wrangles now around 160 people so just

00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,150
being solely focused on javascript over

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,160
the last four years we've grown

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,570
incrementally with the community you

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,300
know building amazing JavaScript

00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,519
applications for our clients we've

00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,310
become a culture consultancy as much as

00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,720
a technology one you know ultimately

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,030
angular is going to be the forefront of

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,700
a lot of the digital transformation and

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,870
sort of competitive initiatives that

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,959
most companies are going to be doing

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,860
because digital is everything now and

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,360
it's hard to identify the most

00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,450
surprising and interesting thing I've

00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,010
learned in the last four years but one I

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,510
think is effective continuous delivery

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:35,019
is simply magic in the angular world

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:38,350
around let's focus on you collaboration

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:39,760
pull requests and reviews drive an open

00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,980
culture and continuous learning at an

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,900
unbelievable pace I've seen it at

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,970
wrangle as we've built our teams I've

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,670
seen it our clients and I've seen it in

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,320
the industry and so as for companies

00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,590
doing new angular 2 projects and

00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,049
shifting the angular 2 I strongly

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,930
suggest looking at continuous delivery

00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:01,480
if not to production for your team to

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,690
collaborate it impacts learning as much

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,950
or more than progress and shared context

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,510
in our minds is the ultimate

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,670
architecture of a software system so

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,010
that's the one thing I want to share

00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,239
from the last four years enjoy the rest

00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,630
of the conference hopefully I haven't

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,920
gone on too long and have a great show

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,980
thank you

00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,980
