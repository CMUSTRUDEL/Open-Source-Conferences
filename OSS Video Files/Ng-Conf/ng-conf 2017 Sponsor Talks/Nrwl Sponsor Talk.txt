I'm Jeff dross along with my

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,750
distinguished partner victor savkin we

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,639
co-founded Narwhal and we just started

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,670
this a few months ago after we left the

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,259
core team of angular at Google where we

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,690
were both involved with different parts

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,260
of framework building it and all sorts

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,090
of fun stuff now we're helping teams

00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,430
with ambitious projects with big

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,769
challenges so figure out tops forward on

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,480
an ongoing basis and to help them really

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,939
do angular right and do it in a way that

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,890
scales so we've been helping teams with

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,690
challenges like äôt with upgrading from

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,950
angular JSO angular and routing state

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,840
management all these things that can be

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,930
kind of complicated and specific to your

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,190
team we've been helping up come up with

00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,710
ways to do it in a way that makes sense

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,450
for your team but instead of me bragging

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,309
about it I wanted to invite my former

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,370
