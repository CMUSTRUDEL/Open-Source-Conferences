00:00:09,545 --> 00:00:10,170
IGOR MINAR: No?

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,950
Oh, OK, now we're good.

00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,770
Hi, everybody.

00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,520
I'm Igor.

00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,190
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,981
AUDIENCE: Hi, Igor.

00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:19,570
IGOR MINAR: Hi. [LAUGHS] So today I'm

00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,694
going to share with you my experience with meditation

00:00:22,694 --> 00:00:23,360
and mindfulness.

00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,210


00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,300
I know that this is a different talk from all the others we've

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,510
seen here.

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,250
And I know that many of you will wonder if this kind of talk

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,130
even belongs to design and engineering conference

00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,460
like ng-conf.

00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,630
I think it does.

00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,720
What motivated me was that I wished that someone did

00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,230
this talk for me in the past.

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,590
When I saw the possibility of helping

00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,512
in this way, at least one person in this room or online,

00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:57,220
it was hard not to seize the opportunity.

00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,210


00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,930
I know that the title of this talk

00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,630
refers to superpowers and power management.

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,130
I don't claim to have superpowers or ability

00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,610
to manage my power yet, but I'm working on it.

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,630
When I or others on the Angular team talk to you,

00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,980
we sense that you give us more credit than what we deserve.

00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,790
Working on Angular 2 has been a great opportunity for us

00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,470
to reflect upon where we are, how we got here,

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,830
and not only as Angular the code base or the APIs,

00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,290
but also Angular the community, the team, and individuals

00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,440
on the team.

00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,560
What we often discover is that we just happen

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,640
to have the right intentions.

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,700
We were on the right place at the right time

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,280
when we worked hard to make these intentions materialize

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,010
into something wonderful.

00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,730
There is no magic in that, no superpowers.

00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,470
But Angular has superpowers.

00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,420
Or at least that's the theme we picked for Angular.

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,160
And this theme makes references to superpowers.

00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,500
It's because we want Angular to enable everyone

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,560
to be more productive when building web applications

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,480
as if they had superpowers.

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,930
Often I read or hear about someone

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,670
being described as talented, which

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,270
I think is the same as having superpowers.

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,210
People often say that successful individuals

00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,770
were born with a talent.

00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,880
I think this is not correct.

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,240
Recently I read a great book called "Nutured by Love,"

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,100
where an influential Japanese musician and pedagogue,

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,150
Shinichi Suzuki, goes into great lengths of describing

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,450
empirical evidence that supports the claim that talent is not

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,590
inborn.

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,430
He explains that the talent is made

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,080
and that once a person acquires a particle talent,

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,200
it is easier for that person to acquire other talents.

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,160
I never really thought about this much,

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,970
but then when I looked around me and looked at biographies

00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,540
of people I admire, there was something

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,790
that they had in common.

00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,270
They worked hard on improving themselves in whatever field

00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,340
they were passionate about.

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,030
OK, great, so now I know what I need

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,100
to do if I want to obtain talent or superpowers.

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,250
I just need to work hard, right?

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,950
So I work and work.

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,400
I spend days and nights working, learning, practicing.

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,290
And I notice that my performance is improving-- exciting.

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,570
But at some point, I get tired of working, learning,

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,600
and practicing.

00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,820
And this is when things that I used to love,

00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,380
things I was passionate, about are

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,410
becoming a burden that is not allowing me to sleep, breathe,

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,740
or live.

00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,760
That's not fun.

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,920
What's worse, is that this feeds the inner voice in me,

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,020
telling me that I'm just not good enough,

00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,150
that this super power bullshit is not for me.

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,960
I was not born with a talent.

00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,700
So why work this hard?

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,579
I've been here many times.

00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,760
I've recovered.

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,430
I tried again.

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,040
I got a bit better.

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,660
Than I burned out again-- again and again and again.

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,140
At one point, I finally realized that maybe I

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,470
was just doing something wrong.

00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,320
And I came to the conclusion that even

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,550
though I was living in this body, that my mind's control.

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,750
I had very little control over my mind.

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,510
And if I wanted to stop the improved burnout cycle,

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,160
I needed to go back to the very essence of being

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,870
and take control over my mind.

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,490
This is when, by chance, I found meditation and mindfulness

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,910
as an option that looked worth exploring.

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,140
There might be other ways to achieve the same.

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,119
This is one that seems to be working for me,

00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,410
so I want to share it with you.

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,030


00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,490
I know what you are thinking now.

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,410
Meditation?

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,480
You mean like those bald monks that walk barefoot and chant

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,440
all day long?

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,750
That's crazy talk.

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,480
It's for hippies or people out of touch with reality.

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,780
That can't be fore me.

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,600
I was thinking the same for years.

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,730
I came across two things that changed my mind.

00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:42,180


00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,910
At Google, I kept on coming across references

00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,440
to mindfulness.

00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,100
Google culture is amazing in that it encourages employees

00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,852
to do almost anything they think is great, as long as they

00:05:56,852 --> 00:05:58,860
are not causing harm.

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,610
So just because a bunch of Googlers

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,410
are enthusiastic about something doesn't mean much.

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,700
When I looked into what this mindfulness hype is all about,

00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,050
it quickly became apparent that this has long

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,020
passed the threshold of just being a volunteer run

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,900
effort at Google.

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,750
Surprisingly, it had nothing to do

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,660
with my mental image of bald, barefoot monks

00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,040
standing on one leg and humming.

00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,330
There were teams building up curriculums, running training

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:34,720
courses, organizing group meditations, and more,

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,260
all in a very secular but inclusive way.

00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,100
Obviously, this was the thing that

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,460
was very important to a large group of people at Google.

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,000
More importantly, this movement was based on science

00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,550
rather than enthusiasm, opinions,

00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,090
or even religious beliefs.

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,170
There are many respectable studies from major universities

00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,270
that scientifically prove the effectiveness

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,540
of mental exercises.

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,310
One study that connected the dots for me

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,150
was a study on neuroplasticity and how

00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:16,020
regular mental exercises can change the physical structure

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,100
of our brains, basically rewire our brains

00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,830
so that they're more suitable at certain tasks.

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:29,850
This sounds a lot like acquiring a superpower late in life.

00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,800
I got curious.

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,230
I learned that brain circuitry evolved

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,670
in several stages, which resulted in responsibilities

00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,890
within our brain being split into several parts, two

00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,810
of which are more important than others

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,940
for the purposes of this talk.

00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,780
The survival-increasing, split-second decisions

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,640
happen in a relatively primitive part

00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:57,790
of the brain called amygdala, while higher-level reasoning

00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,770
that requires more processing power

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,570
happens in prefrontal cortex.

00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,940
A long time ago, it was not very useful

00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,380
to be able to admire pattern of tiger's coat

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,960
when running away or fighting back

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,060
was necessary in order to increase the survival chances.

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,610
This is why the more primitive amygdala had higher priority

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,910
over prefrontal cortex.

00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,700


00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,500
In today's world, our brains are much more

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,230
developed than the brains of our early predecessors.

00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,900
However, one thing we share is the priority order

00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,710
between these brain regions.

00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,280
While we still experience threats,

00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,610
these threats are different.

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,820
They are from coworkers with conflicting goals,

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,620
drivers cutting us off in traffic,

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,280
or coffee that spilled just to make us late for the meeting.

00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,180
For dealing with these kinds of threats,

00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,930
the primitive wiring that determines the fight or flight

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,710
response to a trigger gets in the way more often than not.

00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,600
When I combined what I learned about how a human brain works

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,010
with the discovery of neuroplasticity

00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,010
and a concrete way to train and wire my brain via meditation,

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,800
I started a very interesting and enlightening journey.

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,450
Meditation went from something I considered

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,220
to be a bizarre practice for hippies to something

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,570
that was significantly enhancing my life.

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,030


00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,470
I've always considered physical exercise

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,860
to be an important part of my life,

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,080
but I never thought that mental exercise, even just

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,070
a few minutes every day, could be just as, if not more,

00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:49,360
important, this is, until I read about mindfulness

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,060
and how, at its very core, it is just

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,080
about paying attention to here and now on purpose

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,420
and in a nonjudgmental way.

00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,810
I know.

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,600
It sounds suspicious already.

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,260
But I learned about some of the exercises,

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,030
and I found that the most basic ones are primarily

00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:13,950
about focusing on one's breath as a way to train attention

00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,680
and awareness.

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,120
We breathe every day, all day, from the day we were born,

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,160
without thinking about it much.

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,390
So how much trouble can it be to just pay attention

00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,380
to the breath?

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,186
That's what I thought.

00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:31,310
Then I tried this exercise.

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:36,110


00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,810
This is the part of the talk I was trying hard to avoid.

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,670
But then I decided that it needed to be included.

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,620
I would like to ask you to take 30 seconds away

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,830
from this busy day to just sit here quietly and breathe.

00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,910
If this doesn't sound comfortable to you,

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,210
you don't need to participate.

00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,670
You can, for example, just hold your breath for 30 seconds.

00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,530
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:04,100
But please try to avoid distracting people around you.

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,540
During these 30 seconds, all I want you to do

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,290
is breathe like you normally do and just observe your body,

00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,660
take the air in, and push it out without trying

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,250
to change anything.

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,440
Just observe, feel, and experience

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,290
how this simple process works.

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,030
And focus your attention on the rhythm of your breath

00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,520
and the physical sensations that come with it.

00:11:27,520 --> 00:12:03,300


00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,390
How was it?

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,910
Was it easy, or was it hard?

00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,920
Were you able to focus on your breath for the whole 30

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,220
seconds?

00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,210
Or did you get distracted by your thoughts, thoughts

00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,150
about this conference, your job, your family, or me

00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,577
running you through this weird exercise?

00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,660
Before I tried this for the first time, I thought,

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,790
how hard can it be?

00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,070
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy, as my daughter likes to say.

00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,430
But when I actually tried it, after one minute

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:41,090
I realized that long ago, I stop paying attention to my breath.

00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,490
I realized that I got distracted by a thought

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,850
and another thought and another one.

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,210
And only then I realized, hey, I was supposed to pay attention

00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,230
to my breathing.

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,070
When did I stop?

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,600
And if I was lucky enough, I was able to back trace

00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,880
the weird train of thoughts back to the point where

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,870
I stopped paying attention.

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,330
If you had the same experience, then please,

00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,030
you know that you're not alone.

00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,510
This experience is often referred

00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,580
to as monkey mind since your thoughts

00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,570
are jumping around like a monkey.

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,600
It was this simple exercise that showed me just how little

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,810
control I had over myself.

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,490
And if I had any hopes of acquiring some talent

00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,460
or superpower in the near future,

00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,480
I needed to change that.

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,610


00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,810
Most of us here are engineers.

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,600
We know how to write code that controls computers.

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,610
And we also know how to diagnose and debug

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,350
code that doesn't work well.

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,350
So here is my question for you.

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,510
Isn't our body really just a sophisticated computer

00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,900
and our mind just a really sophisticated software

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,350
controlling this computer?

00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,610
I know that this is a stretch, but if you squint hard enough,

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,500
you can see it that way.

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,780
At least that's what I see.

00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,820
When digging in more into the mindfulness and exercises

00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,550
related to it, I had this revelation.

00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,920
All this stuff is similar to what I do, or try

00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,610
to do, every day at work.

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,270
But rather than applying my work-related techniques

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,310
and processes only to code, I could also

00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,530
apply them to my mind.

00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,300
Let me give you two concrete examples.

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,940
There are several important skills

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,140
you train with these mental exercises.

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,054
Two of the most basic ones are self-awareness and

00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:34,720
self-regulation.

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,940


00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,670
Self-awareness is all about being aware of what

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,040
your body and mind is up to.

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,530
There are many signals that our body and mind generate,

00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,610
but we usually tune them out by default.

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,950
What do we do when we want to know more about an application?

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,106
We start logging and inspecting these logs.

00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:01,480
Well, why couldn't we do the same

00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,320
with our mind and our body?

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,090
Just observe what's going on.

00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,230
Observe the signals.

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,060
And inspect what you see, feel, and think.

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,350
Also, what do we do when we have performance problems

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,890
with an application?

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,180
We start profiling.

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,540
Well, if your work- or non-work-related performance

00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,950
drops, you can profile how you spend your time,

00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,470
identify the bottlenecks, and then devise

00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,170
a strategy to deal with them.

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,920
Self-awareness is the skill that enables

00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,130
us to do logging and profiling of our minds.

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:38,570
With this skill, we build out a great monitoring framework

00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,260
for our mind.

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,320


00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,080
But it's no good to know about issues

00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,330
if we don't do anything about them.

00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,570
This is where self-regulation comes into play.

00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,210
Let's say that you have a bad temper

00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,500
and find yourself regretting some of your actions

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,260
and wishing you can change.

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,920
With self-awareness, you first notice

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,940
that you're getting upset.

00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,740
You can feel yourself getting tense and getting hotter.

00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,150
With self-regulation, you can take action on your observation

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,220
and make a conscious decision to walk

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:24,020
away and not to do something you would later regret.

00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,410
Doesn't this sound just like using a debugger,

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,190
breaking on a line, patching a code that doesn't look right,

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,340
and then resuming?

00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,580
Or maybe you're someone like me that is not

00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,630
great at public speaking.

00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,080
But self-awareness can help you notice

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,040
that you're pacing on the stage and you're speaking too fast.

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,910
Self-regulation can help you calm down and improve.

00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,150
I still have a ton of work to do to improve.

00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,280
But it's cool to see that at least I'm

00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,730
able to observe and notice these things.

00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,460
And that's the first step.

00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,540
And this ties us back to meditation and mindfulness.

00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,400
But actively training our mind, you

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,020
can become more easily aware of yourself

00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,890
in different situations in life and regulate yourself

00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,530
more effectively.

00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,900
If you practice coding a lot, you get good at it.

00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,390
Likewise, if you train your mind,

00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,490
you can also get really good at it.

00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,220
And with these skills, you get to unlock your potential

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,850
to gain other superpowers or talents.

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,550
I shared this story with you because I'm

00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,330
hoping that I can help someone like me from the past.

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,390
If you're interested in learning more,

00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,850
you can check out "Search Inside Yourself"

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,660
book that is based in trainings curriculum developed at Google.

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,800
For more hands-on experience, you

00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,270
can check out headspace.com, a mobile app

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,690
with excellent guided meditations.

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,310


00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,140
I only scratched the surface of what mindfulness is all about.

00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,540
What I love about mindfulness the most

00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:14,170
is that at its very core, it guides me to being kind.

00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:19,160
And kindness is the most important superpower of all.

00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,990
Thank you.

00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,940
[APPLAUSE]
