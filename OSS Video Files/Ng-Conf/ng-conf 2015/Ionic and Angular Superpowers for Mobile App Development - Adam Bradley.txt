00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:02,450
ADAM BRADLEY: Today, I am very excited to talk

00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,180
about my favorite subject, which is

00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,080
building hybrid apps and mobile apps with Ionic and Angular.

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,660
My name is Adam Bradley, I'm the lead developer of Ionic

00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,620
over at Drifty and based in beautiful Madison, Wisconsin.

00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,800
Now, Ionic is built for building hybrid applications,

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,170
but what exactly is a hybrid application?

00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,100
Basically, it's taking a single page web app such as an Angular

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,330
app and wrapping it inside a Cordova or PhoneGap

00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,730
and making it become a native application.

00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,920
But what's really cool about this is that you actually

00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,930
have access to native API such as your camera, Bluetooth,

00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,250
touch ID, things like that.

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,610
But you may have heard in the past,

00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,860
or there might be a negative light shown

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,160
on hybrid applications, but I'm here

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,930
to say that it's not 2007 anymore.

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,300
Actually, the devices that we have have changed drastically.

00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,370
Take a look at the original iPhone

00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,280
and how much has changed in just a short period of time

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,986
and just how drastically the specs that we

00:01:01,986 --> 00:01:04,319
have in the phones that are sitting in our pockets today

00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,310
are night and day difference to the original hybrid app phones.

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,920
But what's more encouraging to me

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,930
is just how fast the standards have improved

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,346
and how much they've improved from what we were originally

00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:15,000
used to.

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,750
Even the older browsers and the older devices

00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,760
have specs and have the standards

00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,375
that we can reliably code against,

00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,750
and this is something that wasn't

00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,610
traditionally available to original hybrid apps.

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,250
And if you look at just in a few short months

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,290
how fast iOS 8 has taken over to dominate the globe compared

00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,884
to iOS 7.

00:01:34,884 --> 00:01:36,300
And that, again, this is something

00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,690
that's very amazing that wasn't available in the past.

00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,340
And even iOS 7 was already a great operating system.

00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,250
And what's great about Android is in 4.3 and below

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,800
actually it had the Android browser,

00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,800
which I kind of like to label as the IE6 of mobile.

00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,380
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,010
Well, now, what's cool is you can

00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:58,900
see it's doing a nosedive here and Android 4.4 now

00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,355
has Chromium based, meaning it's basically the Chrome browser

00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,500
is in the backend.

00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,470
And what's even cooler is in Android 5.0

00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,520
it now has a self updating browser.

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,430
So it's getting only better and better.

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,010
So really what my point is that everything you've

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,950
heard in the past is night and day difference

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,884
to what the landscape is nowadays.

00:02:19,884 --> 00:02:21,300
So you want to build a hybrid app.

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,040
Great.

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,320
But really, Native SDKS are great too.

00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,660
I'm not knocking Native whatsoever.

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,400
Native SDKS provide these great APIs to control the UI, views,

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,160
navigation, and common structure,

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,360
and great gestures, transitions, all that.

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,650
It comes with this built in SDK for iOS and Android and all

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,844
the others.

00:02:41,844 --> 00:02:43,010
So let's build a hybrid app.

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,920
But this is the problem.

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,830
All that stuff didn't come with it.

00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,640
It's not fair to compare iOS to hybrid

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,350
because iOS comes with all the Native navigation, tabs,

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,950
scrolling built right in.

00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,460
When you want to build a Cordova or PhoneGap app,

00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,360
you basically have a wrapper for an HTML file

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,590
and that's all you're given.

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,131
So then that means everyone is having

00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:06,650
to reinvent the wheel of how does an app work.

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,610
And so this got us thinking we need to be able

00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,580
provide a great way to provide mobile interactions

00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,830
and mobile interfaces rather than just legacy

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,050
desktop user interfaces.

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,990
And as you can guess, this is where Ionic comes in.

00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,340
This is where Ionic provides that missing

00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,670
SDK that traditionally hybrid apps did not have.

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,350
And this also shares a same common goal as Native SDKS

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,400
as we want you really to focus on building your app

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,572
and what you want your app to do rather than trying

00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:41,780
to recreate how an app works.

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,196
It's a subtle difference, but it's

00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:45,830
a very significant difference.

00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,100
And my favorite part is that it's all

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,440
based off of web technologies you already know and love.

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,450
If you've ever built a web page before,

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,010
you are now a native app developer

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,010
for multiple platforms.

00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,690


00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,190
And also we want to build not just CSS demos,

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,370
but actually large scale app development or large scale

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,170
apps.

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,290
And we will be able to do this with directives and services.

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,150
And you're at an Angular conference

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,780
so I'm guessing that you guys are aware of this.

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,360
So it actually helps out drastically

00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,850
to be able to use Angular to extend these apps

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,200
and build large scale apps, not just little CSS demos.

00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,250
And from the ground up, Ionic has been built with sass,

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,790
meaning that all of our variables and mixins

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,880
are built for you to customize.

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,550
So we don't want a bunch of apps that look like Ionic,

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,760
but rather a bunch of Ionic apps that were built with Ionic

00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,000
and you never know.

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,150
And we also provide platform continuity.

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,800
And what I mean by that is we make subtle changes

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,130
to the app with the same code base.

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,870
So in this example here, iOS prefers

00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,910
to have tabs on the bottom, Android

00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,440
prefers tabs on the top.

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,132
But the code base behind this all is identical.

00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,965
However, someone who uses the Android device

00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:01,710
is very used to the tabs on the top.

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,422
And someone who has iOS has them on the bottom.

00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:06,130
So this is one of those things that we're

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,622
able to provide that allows this platform continuity.

00:05:09,622 --> 00:05:11,330
And this is only one example, we actually

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,788
have many others where it's adjusting for you automatically

00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:16,112
and it's all highly configurable.

00:05:16,112 --> 00:05:17,820
And so this is how it all comes together.

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,160
We want you to build your app with your customizations,

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,760
your colors, your business logic to make your unique app.

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,210
Next is Ionic, and that's where we provide that missing

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,070
SDK which traditionally iOS and Android would provide

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,230
that SDK of how a view works, how it views transition

00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,450
and things like that.

00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,800
Then there's Angular-- which you all know and love--

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,940
all which comes together to build that single page web

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,212
application that fits inside of a web view.

00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:42,586
Now, basically what a web view is

00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:44,840
is simply a full screen web browser

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,240
but without the URL bar.

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,390
And the really cool thing is is that you still

00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,500
have the same Native access to cameras and Bluetooth

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,110
and all that that the same stuff which Native applications have.

00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,715
All of which creates a Native app,

00:05:57,715 --> 00:05:59,340
which is downloadable and even sellable

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,082
from the Apple App store and Google Play Store.

00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:06,790
Now, there's lots of components to Ionic,

00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,750
but in the interest of time I'll just focus on a few of them

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,760
here.

00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,670
So, one of my favorites is collection repeat,

00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,280
which is pretty much replacement for ng-repeat.

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,700
One difference is here, let's say

00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,170
I have my collection of 3,000 cats.

00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,350
It's a huge array of my 3,000 favorite cats.

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,350
Now, traditionally with ng-repeat

00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,440
it's going to render out 3,000 items, which is a little large.

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,280
However, what collection repeat does

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,510
is it's only rendering the viewable ones.

00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,520
And if you were to scroll through this on your phone,

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,720
you're going to be amazed that this is not

00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,230
a hybrid application and just how smooth it's scrolling,

00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,590
because what we're doing here is only showing you

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,930
a handful of elements at a time and only rendering

00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,372
the ones that are in the viewable area.

00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,580
And this is offering amazing performance and actually

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,040
a trick that we stole iOS.

00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,980
This is exactly how iOS and Android

00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,584
is able to have their apps smooth scrolling, too.

00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,375
Next is navigation.

00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,670


00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,154
This is a huge part of allowing users to develop their app

00:07:05,154 --> 00:07:06,570
and not have to worry about, well,

00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,944
how does it view transition work?

00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:09,400
How does it look on iOS?

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,710
How does look it on Android?

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,190
Things like that.

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,280
And what's even great is that we're

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,100
able to provide multiple history stacks.

00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,640
So traditionally in a web browser,

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,214
you have a forward and back button.

00:07:19,214 --> 00:07:21,380
So you can go to page one, page two, and page three.

00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,588
Then you hit the Back button.

00:07:22,588 --> 00:07:25,420
You go to page two, so you start going back,

00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,870
and that's just a linear stack.

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,960
But with Ionic, we're able to replicate

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,320
exactly how Native applications work such as with tabs.

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,310
So here I'm in the Home tab and I

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,686
go to view two of the Home tab.

00:07:35,686 --> 00:07:36,810
It's still in the Home tab.

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,670
I go one in.

00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,210
And now I have a Back button over in the Home here.

00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,472
Now if I go to the About tab, again,

00:07:42,472 --> 00:07:44,930
don't have a Back button because I'm in a whole new history

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,430
stack.

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,970
And let's go to view two of the About tab.

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,780
Same thing, now I have a Back button.

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,960
Now if I return to the Home tab, I

00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,550
return back to view two of that home tab,

00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,280
and my Back button is to go to view one of the Home tab,

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,860
whereas a traditional web or desktop

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,449
navigation would have taken you back to the About tab.

00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,990
So these are those subtle differences

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,120
that we're able to provide that traditional desktop legacy

00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,380
applications do not have.

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,880
Next, what I'm really thrilled about

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,020
is to talk about cached views.

00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,478
And actually Angular too has been talking about this a lot.

00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:20,690
So this is pretty cool that we're all in line.

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,870
So basically as you are navigating between views,

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,129
the previous views stay in the DOM

00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:27,920
and the scope is disconnected so it doesn't

00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,504
add to that digest cycle.

00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:30,670
But the state is maintained.

00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,950
The data's maintain.

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,799
So where this really is awesome is when you have a large list

00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,780
again and let's say you scroll down halfway through the list,

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,419
you navigate in a little bit or you

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,980
navigate to the first detail page, and when you return,

00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,438
you're still going to be at the exact same area you were at

00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:46,990
before because the scroll position is maintained

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,500
and all that data that you once loaded

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,800
is still there sitting for you ready to use.

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,080
We also introduced life cycle events

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,730
where your app is told before it enters, after it enters,

00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,710
before it leaves, and so on and so forth.

00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,380
And all of this is highly configurable.

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,284
And remember how I said that we're actually caching views

00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:08,450
and we're keeping them in the DOM so check this out.

00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,490
Let's go to page two.

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,530
And just like with the Native app,

00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,330
we can swipe to go back which is pretty cool.

00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,640
And it actually has offered amazing performance.

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,710
And it still updates the URL just how it normally would,

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,126
because this is no different than hitting the back button.

00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:27,100


00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,100
And there's actually many, many other components

00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,840
we added to Ionic, and I encourage

00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,520
you to check out Ionicframework.com and see

00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,940
all the different stuff that we provide with it.

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,630
But in the interest of time I'm going to keep moving on.

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:45,790
Ionic also comes with over 700 MIT licensed font-icons

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,140
that you can use to include material design and iOS icons.

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,840
And if you've used Ionicons in the past,

00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,030
you may be wondering why we removed rotating icons.

00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:58,817
And that is because we now have animated SVGs, which we realize

00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:00,650
that just rotating an aesthetic image really

00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,600
wasn't that cool, so we wanted to provide something that

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,420
looked a little bit cooler, and that's

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,382
what we were able to do here.

00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:10,340
But if there's one thing I really want everyone

00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,300
to know from this talk is that there's

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,920
much, much more to Ionic than just some JavaScript and CSS.

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,970
We actually provide an entire ecosystem and community

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,345
to help you build your apps fast.

00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:22,870


00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,080
For starters, we have our Ionic CLI.

00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,020
And without meeting going too far into it

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,970
and just talking about it, why don't we just do some changes

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:31,690
here quick.

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,110
Wish me luck.

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,230
AUDIENCE: Good luck.

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,230
ADAM BRADLEY: Thank you.

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,480
All right, so assuming you already

00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,040
have Ionic CLI installed using the MPM, what you would do

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,990
is Ionic start myapp, which is the name of the directory I'm

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,880
going to use.

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,735
And then we're used to a tabs starter template.

00:10:49,735 --> 00:10:51,590
And I'm going to kick it off here,

00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,390
not one to trust any internet connection,

00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,980
so I already had it pre-built.

00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,290
I cheated a little bit there.

00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:57,790
OK.

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,017
So now let's do Ionic serve, which

00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:01,850
is going to fire up this development server.

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,480


00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,430
And there you have it.

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,520
We already have an Ionic app built ready

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,130
for you to customize.

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,010
But the next cool thing is that we actually

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,940
provide live reload also.

00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,680
Let this guy download a bit.

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,270
So what we have here is the bar is colored bar stable,

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,139
as you can see here.

00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:25,430
And what that means is that that's like a default color

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,388
that Ionic comes with, but these are the colors

00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:28,790
that you're meant to customize.

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,490
Let's just go in here and let's use--

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,270
I don't like stable-- let's use positive.

00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,250
Cool emotional color that we gave it.

00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,970
And you see how the bar live reloaded

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,650
there to use the stable or the positive color?

00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,930
And let's go into tabs.

00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,250
And we also want to have our tabs to use positive also.

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,040
Hit Save.

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,268
Live reloads.

00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:49,180
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,670
ADAM BRADLEY: Thank you.

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,490
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,692
All right.

00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:55,590
That's just live reload for a web browser.

00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,590
Big deal, right?

00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,920
OK, so let's go back in to here.

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,790
And remember how I was talking about platform continuity?

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,565
So, Ionic serve dash dash lab.

00:12:06,565 --> 00:12:10,500


00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,780
Now you can see how the exact same code base actually

00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,640
is showing the two different differences.

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,000
So I wrote it once, but it's able to adjust

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,930
for Android and iOS.

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,590
And the same thing if I were to go into the different views

00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,910
and navigate a little bit, you see

00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,150
how they have different icons and different transitions.

00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,132
But also we don't want a bunch of Ionic apps

00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:35,215
that look like Ionic apps.

00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:37,520
We want you guys to start customizing this.

00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,970
So let's go one step further.

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,240
So our actual app test started was ready to go.

00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,710
So cd into my app.

00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,250
And this is where you would set up sass.

00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,800
You can set up sass however you'd

00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,397
like to do it with Gulp, Grunt, but we provided a tool

00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,480
that makes it even easier.

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,140
So Ionic setup sass.

00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,740
And for the same reasons in the interest of time,

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,140
I already set it up.

00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,710
So with Sass built in and I already

00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:13,160
have the server running, let's go back to Sublime.

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,120
And you can see our Sass file where I have everything going

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,340
off the default positive color.

00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,100
I wish this had more space to show you the differences.

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,467
But here we go.

00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,050
So the positive colors based off here.

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,440
But if your company had to have your own green, hit Save,

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,290
it's going to live reload immediately.

00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,560
So, again, the entire Ionic CSS is now

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,019
based off of your colors and your variables.

00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:37,560
And you can start going crazy in here

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,577
and start making it your own app, making it unique to you,

00:13:40,577 --> 00:13:42,910
rather than having to override every single little color

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,840
that we've set.

00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,710
These colors were very generic on purpose

00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,070
so that you do override them.

00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,260
But we're only in Chrome right now, right?

00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,186
That's no big deal.

00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:52,810
We actually want to build Cordova apps.

00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,330
Let's take it one more step further.

00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,300
Let's quit the server.

00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,070
Let's do Ionic run iOS.

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,420
And let's still do live reload.

00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,080
So what's going to happen here is

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,360
I'm actually assuming you already have Xcode installed

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,870
and Cordova is installed on your computer.

00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:15,200
This is going to fire up the simulator.

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,120
Let's shrink that down a little bit.

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,240
Perfect.

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,350
And now we have an actually live reloading.

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,440
This is the similar.

00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,775
And because I'm presenting, I'm using the similar

00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:26,150
so you can see it on my computer,

00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,900
but you could actually have an entire desk

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,690
full of different devices-- Android devices, iOS devices,

00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:38,071
iPads-- and as you're making changes,

00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:40,320
these devices which are not connected to your computer

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,611
are going to be live reloading.

00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:43,940
And you saw how long it took to build, right?

00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,565
Now you don't have to worry about that.

00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:48,530
You can just save, encode, and watch all these devices change

00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,370
as you're changing.

00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,950
And it's actually pretty cool to do

00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,791
and it's a huge performance improvement for itself.

00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,237
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:57,237 --> 00:14:57,737
Thank you.

00:14:57,737 --> 00:15:02,170


00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,260
And let's just take it one more step further.

00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,456
Let's go into the dashboard here.

00:15:08,456 --> 00:15:11,217
Uncomment this button and hit Save.

00:15:11,217 --> 00:15:12,300
It's going to live reload.

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,507
We now have a button here.

00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:15,340
And let's take a look at our JavaScript file

00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,061
where the controllers are.

00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:18,560
And when you click this button, it's

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,620
going to print out console log hello ng-conf 2015, right?

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,120
So in Chrome you're going to see that printed out

00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,559
on your console log.

00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,350
That's no big deal.

00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,610
That's not a trick at all.

00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,906
But when you have an actual device in your hand

00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:34,280
that's not connected to your computer or an older Android

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,557
device and all the different scenarios,

00:15:36,557 --> 00:15:38,390
it's very hard to get these console logs out

00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,520
without jumping through a lot of hoops.

00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,940
That's why within our CLI we also--

00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,600
console logs, enable the console logs-- they can all show up

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,555
in your console logs too, which is a huge performance

00:15:50,555 --> 00:15:51,697
development.

00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:53,682
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:54,182
Thank you.

00:15:54,182 --> 00:16:00,760


00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,260
All right.

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,290
We made it.

00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:02,980
Cool.

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,479
All right.

00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:06,170
So remember how I said that Android browser 4.3 and below

00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,530
was like the IE6 of mobile?

00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,670
Well, actually the Ionic CLI also

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,050
provides a way to replace that stock browser

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,950
with modern Chromium builds.

00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,850
What that means is this is a great way

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,224
to really fight that fragmentation

00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:21,890
problem that Android has because now you're replacing that stock

00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:26,350
browser that your app would have run on with the latest

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,660
and greatest Chrome, which offers amazing performance

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,880
improvements.

00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,630
And I highly recommend whenever you're building an Android app.

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,830
But what I really find cool about

00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,645
this is that you're using the exact same hardware

00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:37,290
and replacing it with modern software

00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,480
and you are getting this amazing performance improvement.

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,270
So think about what that's like-- we're

00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,360
doing that on old phones.

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,790
Think about what hybrid apps are like on today's phones

00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:49,020
and tomorrow's phones where we have faster harder and faster

00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,960
software.

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,707
So this is great proof of how hybrid has a great future

00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:54,540
and how the web platform has a great future.

00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,000


00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,500
Other projects that Ionic comes with

00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,630
is ngCordova which is a great way to hook

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:09,790
into the camera, Bluetooth, all the other same Native

00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,720
applications can hook into but with the niceties of Angular.

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,140
So in a few lines of code, you can use Angular services

00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,339
and Angular promises to get a hold of the camera

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:21,670
within your JavaScript app.

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,740
Next is we're rolling out Ionic IO.

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,700
This is the new services that Ionic

00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,619
is starting to roll out with providing

00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:30,590
push notification, analytics, AB testing, Live

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,510
Updating, and many various other services

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,300
that we're starting to push out just now

00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,410
with our first one being push notifications.

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,050
And I'd encourage you to check out this URL.

00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:42,610
Take a look.

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,970
And this is just a subtle thing that Ionic

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,717
is starting to provide of taking a complicated process

00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:48,800
and making it even easier.

00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,420
So if you need push notifications

00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,790
in your hybrid app, please check these out.

00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,570
And we also have the Ionicview app.

00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,560
So what that is it's great for contractors in large teams

00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,740
and a lot of team members who aren't day-to-day coders

00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,126
that they can actually view the development of your app

00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,460
that you're working on within their own device.

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,400
So you can load it up with all these different apps

00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,080
you're working on, and other people that are not developers

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,390
can now download this app and view the app directly

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,740
on their phone, which is another great way to speed up

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,520
your development time.

00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,770
And we have the IonicCreator, which is a drag and drop

00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,130
interface builder for Ionic.

00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,640
So if you want to kick off a project really quickly--

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,740
go ahead.

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,010
And we couldn't be more proud of the Ionic community.

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,530
It's amazing just how fast it's taken off.

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,270
And so thank you to everyone who's

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,430
been IRC channels, Stack Overflow, the forum, all

00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,105
the pull requests we receive.

00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:43,980
We couldn't be more proud to be a part of it.

00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,100
And I'm personally honored to be a part of this whole thing that

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,670
is Ionic.

00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,580
So thank you.

00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,370
Thank you to everyone in this room.

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,453
Thank you to everyone around the world for helping

00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:54,036
it make Ionic what it is today.

00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:55,926
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:56,426
Thank you.

00:18:56,426 --> 00:19:00,630


00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,130
And we've seen a huge adoption rate.

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,200
We've had over 14,000 GitHub stars,

00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,080
over 70,000 downloads per month from MPM, and over 400,000 apps

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,140
have been started from our CLI.

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,310
And I'm also pretty thrilled to announce that we are finally

00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,440
have released Release Candidate Zero as of a couple minutes

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,050
ago.

00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,438
So that's out.

00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:21,848
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:21,848 --> 00:19:23,780


00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,026
And there's a lot more coming.

00:19:27,026 --> 00:19:28,150
We're only getting started.

00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,280
I'm very excited about all that.

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,571
There's so much more coming such as removing JavaScript

00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:34,410
scrolling when possible, more component modularity, more

00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:39,450
Ionic IO services, and there's so much more to come.

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,180
And before you start asking-- and many have-- yes,

00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,900
absolutely Angular 2 with Ionic.

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,340
We're absolutely going to do that.

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,830
We've already been starting to work with Angular team

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,090
a little bit on that.

00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,617
And I've been so impressed with it.

00:19:52,617 --> 00:19:54,700
The performance improvements we're getting from it

00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,530
is amazing.

00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,732
So before anyone starts asking me-- absolutely,

00:19:58,732 --> 00:19:59,690
we're going to do that.

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,990
But do know that we're still going to support version 1

00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,966
and apps you're building today.

00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:06,340
So I love talking all this stuff.

00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,320
I love talking to Ionic, so please come find me afterwards.

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,430
It's all the time I have, but thank you.

00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,780
[APPLAUSE]
