[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:01:17,398 --> 00:01:21,517


00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:22,475
SHAI REZNICK: OK, guys.

00:01:22,475 --> 00:01:26,150


00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,880
How all is?

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,870
How is?

00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,526
No.

00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:30,400
I don't know English.

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:30,930
Never mind.

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,150
OK.

00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,960
My name is Shai Reznik.

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,190
I'm so excited to be here, as you can see.

00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,260
And today we're going to do something special together.

00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,820
For this, I will need your full cooperation.

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,630
So for starters, let's meet everybody.

00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,980
Let's get to know one another.

00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,230
All the people from the United States, please raise your hands

00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,720
and leave it up.

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,056
OK, now, all the rest, also raise your hand.

00:01:58,056 --> 00:01:59,180
Everybody leave your hands.

00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,050
OK, now give high five to each other.

00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,050
OK, say your name quickly.

00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,500
Say your name to each other.

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,180
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,889
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,539
OK.

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,281
OK, that's it.

00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:10,780
Shut up.

00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,279
Yeah.

00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:11,920
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,570
OK.

00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,290
Now, on the count of three, yell the name you've heard.

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:16,790
OK?

00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,242
One, two, three.

00:02:18,242 --> 00:02:19,625
[YELLING]

00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,470


00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,070
SHAI REZNICK: I will call you guys Shooah.

00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,260
OK.

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,891
So Shooah, let's all stand up.

00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:29,615
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:30,560
Don't be lazy.

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,470
Don't be lazy.

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,000
OK.

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,058
Now, clap and yell as loud as you can, as hard as you can.

00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:39,992
[YELLING AND CHEERING]

00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:42,150
OK, OK, thank you.

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,830
Thank you.

00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,638
Thank you.

00:02:43,638 --> 00:02:45,878
Thank you.

00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:47,040
Thank you very much.

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,400
You can all sit down.

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,980
OK, now I can tell my friends I got a standing ovation.

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,370
OK, now that we are all warmed up,

00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,250
let's begin our NG-Wat Talk.

00:02:59,250 --> 00:02:59,860
OK.

00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,142
So who am I?

00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:01,850
I'm Shai Reznick.

00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,560
My main hobby in life is doing improv,

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,770
which is a mix of stand-up comedy and stage play acting,

00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,620
but improvised.

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,180
I've been doing front end development for over 10 years,

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,440
and I run the largest JavaScript meetup group in Israel.

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,090
For the past few years, I've been teaching and consulting

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,600
for over 20 enterprise companies and startups,

00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,400
teaching web development.

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,450
And this is an illustration of me consulting.

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,470
So if you will hire me, this is how it will look like.

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,570
OK, so I've been lecturing all over the world

00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,980
and mainly telling people how great Angular is.

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,480
OK.

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,750
So recently I combined the two passions of mine, improv

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,930
and front end development and founded HiRez.io,

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,470
which is an online training school that teaches front end

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,520
development and architecture, but for people

00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:11,350
who have a short attention span and love nonsense humor.

00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,600
OK, so about this talk.

00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,899
So when I thought about what should I do for this talk--

00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,089
I forgot to do stuff.

00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:24,220
So when I thought about this stuff, I thought to myself, OK,

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,050
I need to do something interesting.

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:32,660
I remember a very funny talk called JavaScript Wat

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,510
by Gary Bernhardt, where he explained and illustrated

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,700
weird stuff about JavaScript using "wat" pictures.

00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,080
What are "wat" pictures, you ask?

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,620
Here is an example.

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,100
OK.

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,960
He actually allowed me to use this photo.

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,510
We emailed and stuff.

00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,050
Here's another example.

00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,680
I don't know.

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,030
OK.

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:05,350
So I thought to myself, wait a minute.

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,360
I have a PhD in wat pictures.

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,110


00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,550
So, ladies and gentlemen, I now present to you the NG-Wat talk.

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,490


00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,330
Take a minute to fill it in, Leonardo and the baby.

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,990
OK.

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,340
So let's talk about Angular, shall we?

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,460
So every framework, its key feature

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,360
is the documentation, right?

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,720
So in Angular, we have wonderful documentation.

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,450
Everything's so simple and clear.

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,510
Let's say we want to have a Select box, right?

00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,470
And we want to bind it to an array of options.

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,110
OK, so what do we do?

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,590
We go to the Select Documentation,

00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,070
and we search for ng options, right?

00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,720
And we just read it.

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,340
So let's read.

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,410
For array data sources, label for value in array,

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,250
select as label for value in array,

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:13,040
label group by group for value in array, select as label group

00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,003
by group for value in array.

00:06:15,003 --> 00:06:17,550
[CHEERING AND CLAPPING]

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,500
Wait.

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,845
I have only 10 minutes.

00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:21,345
Wat?

00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:26,940


00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,900
OK.

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,870
OK, OK.

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,676
Shirt time!

00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:33,550


00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,514
[YELLING] You!

00:06:36,514 --> 00:06:38,490
What's your name?

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,739
AUDIENCE: Dave.

00:06:39,739 --> 00:06:40,530
SHAI REZNICK: Dave!

00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,740
Wonderful name.

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,180
OK.

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,680
Great.

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,770
So let's continue.

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,710
Let's talk about filters.

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,780
OK, filters, yay!

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,710
Exciting.

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,770
So as we all know, filters in Angular

00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,130
are those pipe thingies that you put in your expression, right?

00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,470
This is the professional term-- pipe thingies.

00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,650
OK, so if we want to add a filter,

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,430
we go to the documentation, and we

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,850
see that in our filters documentation,

00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,010
we have the first item, which is a filter.

00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,410


00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,494
So we have a filter, which is a filter.

00:07:21,494 --> 00:07:21,994
Wat?

00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:26,690


00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,560
OK, story time.

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,480
Two years ago, I was consulting to a client, and one

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,650
of the developers in the team, I asked him to add a filter.

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,520
And he asked me, which one?

00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,100
And I said, the filter.

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,010
And he asked, yeah, but which one?

00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,750
And I said, the filter.

00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,800
The filter filter.

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,543
And he asked, OK, but which one?

00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:48,505
And I said, the filter!

00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:50,910
You have the filter, and you have your filters,

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,200
and you have a filter.

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,070
So just use the filter.

00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,970
And he looked at me like, wat?

00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,970


00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,780
Like, guys, seriously, the Angular team,

00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,670
why are you doing this to us?

00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,604
Why?

00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:06,580
Why confusing?

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,160
Why?

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,070
Why calling the stuff the same name?

00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,770
OK, like, calling a filter "filter"

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:21,640
is like calling your son "son."

00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,150
You just don't do it.

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,320
OK.

00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,650
But you know we all make mistakes, and it's fine.

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,940
It's fine.

00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,700
As long as it don't happen twice, right?

00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,562


00:08:34,562 --> 00:08:38,855
[LAUGHTER AND CLAPPING]

00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:39,819
You did it again.

00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,900
You did it again.

00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,030
Which services?

00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,530
Why?

00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,280
Calling the same name!

00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,480
What is happening?

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,750
Why are you playing-- what sick game are you playing with us

00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,910
that you do this stuff to us?

00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,160
I don't really know.

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,460
What is going on your meetings, like,

00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,890
when you decide on the name?

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:09,130
I imagine, like, smoke and reggae music and buffalo

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,160
and joints are passed around.

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,080
And then Igor, like, takes a joint.

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:27,578
And he is like, fuck it, let's call them services.

00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:28,480
Aha ha!

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,660
We'll confuse them.

00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,840
And everybody laughs and hugs a Chihuahua or whatever

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,420
you guys are doing in Google.

00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,300
I don't know.

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,990
OK, take a minute.

00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,180
OK, so let's talk about something completely different.

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,930
Let's talk about services.

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,200
So we have services.

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,630
We have the service and the factory and the provider.

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,060
And apparently, it's the second most voted question

00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,290
in Stack Overflow, which I don't understand why,

00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,095
because it's such a clear concept.

00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:01,680


00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,800
So Angular, let me do you a favor.

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,990
I'm a consultant, so let me teach you

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,246
a really, really super easy explanation to beginners

00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,370
just starting with Angular.

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,560
It goes like this.

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,250
Really simple.

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,760
You have a factory, which is a service,

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,460
and you have a service, which is a service.

00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,830
And both have providers.

00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,870
And when you write a factory as your service,

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:39,610
you actually write a provider, which returns a factory, which

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,930
is basically a service.

00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,750


00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,360
I think my work here is done.

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,335
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:52,835
No, no, no.

00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:53,330
That's OK.

00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:53,830
That's OK.

00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,300
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,775
Wait, wait, wait.

00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:00,260
Whoa, whoa.

00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,735
I have five more minutes, five more minutes!

00:11:02,735 --> 00:11:03,850
Wait, wait, wait.

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,350
No, no.

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,030
I was kidding.

00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,930
Nailed it.

00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,720
OK.

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,193
Shirt time!

00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:11,660
[CHEERING]

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,770
You laughed the hardest.

00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,560
OK, cool OK, awesome.

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,070
So let's look up a directive now.

00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,840
So people really think that the Angular team

00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,290
wrote the directive, the API-- wow, one

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,280
try-- just to confuse us, right?

00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,875
But it's not true.

00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:37,210
They actually wanted to make us smarter, right?

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,660
So they want to challenge our minds

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,130
so it will grow with things like when to use the compile

00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,220
and when to use the link function, when to use the link

00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,810
function and when to use the controller,

00:11:50,810 --> 00:12:02,250
or like pre-link and post-link and that thing, whatever

00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,580
that is.

00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,960
Wat-ever that is.

00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:15,510
Because it really grows your mind, you see?

00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:20,170
It's like expanding your horizon, right?

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,670
It's like really mind blowing.

00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,520
OK, but let's stop talking about stuff that

00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,481
are confusing in the directive.

00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:31,730
Let's talk about transclusion.

00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:36,070


00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,320
So to those of you who don't know,

00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,250
transclusion is when you wat?

00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:48,300


00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:54,190
This is actually much clearer than the actual explanation

00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,200
of transclusion.

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,360
This really puts the point much better

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,440
than the actual documentation.

00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:13,280
So Misko, why did you bring back the term from the '80s,

00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,230
from the depths of computer science?

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,940
Even the guy who invented it, like, that's not a real word.

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,390
So I would like to welcome Misko to the stage just briefly.

00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:30,000
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,420
On behalf of all the developers ever

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,040
that ever misused the word "transclusion,"

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,900
I give you this T-shirt, OK?

00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,900
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,970
So you will be reminded every time.

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,830
Thank you very much.

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,652


00:13:54,652 --> 00:13:56,580
Also, by the way, I have more T-shirts.

00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,032
I am selling $30 a piece, OK?

00:13:59,032 --> 00:14:00,760
So great.

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:07,110
So Angular is known as a superheroic MVW

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,090
framework, which obviously, MVW stands for Model View

00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:17,160
and "Wat."

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,090
Yeah.

00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:26,410
But on a serious, note a superheroic framework would

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,400
only be done by superheroes.

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,992
And I'm talking about, of course,

00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:34,010
the Angular team and the Angular community, right?

00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,800
So I really love you guys, everyone in the community.

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,770
And I think the best feature of Angular

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,670
is not dependence injection or services or testing or stuff

00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,560
like that.

00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,930
It's the community.

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,860
And the great community comes from great leaders.

00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,440
So thank you, guys, really.

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,860
Sorry about the cliches and stuff,

00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,410
but this is really how I feel.

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,450
And it wasn't a joke.

00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,700
Why do you laugh?

00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,665
And so to end this session, this short session-- I

00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:10,200
had, like, 40 minutes of materials,

00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,920
but I need to cut it down.

00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,720
I would like to ask us all, me included,

00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,680
that although this talk was complaining about Angular

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,820
and stuff like that, but I want to send out this message.

00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,770
Let's make a rule, OK?

00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,070
Every time we want to complain or criticize,

00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,756
let's create a pull request instead, OK?

00:15:34,756 --> 00:15:36,540
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,432


00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:39,265
And help support this guy.

00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:44,260


00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,930
So I'm Shai Reznick from HiRez.io,

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,020
and I want to leave you with this message

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,670
so you will remember, OK?

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,210
Just remember that--

00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:58,260
[MUSIC HADDAWAY, "WHAT IS LOVE"] Wat is love?

00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,432
OK, thank you very much.

00:16:00,432 --> 00:16:01,818
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:15,420


00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,870
Gracias, senors y senoras.
