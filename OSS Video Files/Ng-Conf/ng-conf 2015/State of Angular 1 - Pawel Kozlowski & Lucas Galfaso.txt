00:00:00,745 --> 00:00:01,870
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: All right.

00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,286
LUCAS MIRELMANN: Hello, everybody.

00:00:03,286 --> 00:00:05,850
I'm Lucas, and I'm a software engineer at Google.

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,102
I'm an Angular Core contributor.

00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:09,060
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Hello.

00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,730
I'm Pawel.

00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,300
I'm working in Amadeus, and I'm a longtime Angular JS

00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,750
contributor.

00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,510
So today, both Lucas and me representing Angular 1 team.

00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,650
Unfortunately, our team lead couldn't make it

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,988
to the ng-conf this year.

00:00:23,988 --> 00:00:25,330
AUDIENCE: Can't hear you.

00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,710
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Fix the mic.

00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,810
I can move it.

00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,919
Is it better now?

00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:31,460
AUDIENCE: No.

00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,957
LUCAS MIRELMANN: No.

00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:34,790
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: OK.

00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,470
I can keep it.

00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,800
That's good.

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,320
OK, so, unfortunately, Pete, our new team lead,

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,870
couldn't make it ng-conf this year.

00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,240
But we still will try to do our best to present

00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,260
the state of Angular 1.

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,180
LUCAS MIRELMANN: So, we want to show you

00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,810
what happened the last six months with Angular 1.

00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,784
And we had some very exciting things to show you.

00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:01,200
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Right, but before

00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,430
diving into the content of 1.4, let's look

00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,740
at what people are building with the current version

00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,990
of AngularJS.

00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,390
So, as brother [INAUDIBLE] was saying,

00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,790
Angular 1 is today the framework version

00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,420
that you can use to deploy production-ready applications.

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,580
And people do this.

00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,170
And just look at this tweet.

00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,470
It just says it all, right?

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,810
LUCAS MIRELMANN: Yeah, we're really excited what

00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,580
the community's doing with big partners doing it,

00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,270
and it really helps us a lot.

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,800
Angular 1 is really used by a lot of big companies.

00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,050
This is just amazing.

00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,987


00:01:44,987 --> 00:01:47,070
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Right, so I know that you are all

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,780
waiting for the futures and the back fixes that went into 1.4.

00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,490
But before we start, we should really

00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,000
take time to thank all the people who took time

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,030
to contribute the back reports, pull requests, or documentation

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,040
fixes.

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,392
Without your continuous support, those releases

00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,350
wouldn't look the same.

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,081


00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:10,039
LUCAS MIRELMANN: One thing we want to highlight

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,220
is the community engagement.

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,850
We actually had every two weeks 100,000 unique visitors

00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,950
go and engage with the Angular repository.

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,390
This is put in pull request.

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,430
Put in issues.

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,720
Commenting on issues.

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,100
It's just amazing.

00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,960
Six months ago, this same chart only showed 50,000.

00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,380
This is in the last six months it doubled.

00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,662
This is just great.

00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:39,590
[CHEERS]

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,890


00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,390
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: The best part of it

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,900
is just those people now just coming to the GitHub

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,860
and looking around reading.

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,610
They are actually coming there and creating the content.

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,125
So looking at the other stats, you

00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,620
can see that we've had over 1,600 new pull

00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,580
requests on the issues.

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,400
And we had almost 200 new first-time contributors.

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,490
This is just amazing.

00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,744
Thank you.

00:03:02,744 --> 00:03:04,230
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,212


00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:08,980
LUCAS MIRELMANN: Out of the contributors,

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,180
we wanted to highlight two, Martin and Shahar.

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,160
They are two new core contributors.

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,330
They stepped up.

00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,630
They put the effort and just made it.

00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,170
Another thing that is really great

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,520
is that 50% of all contributions, all PRs,

00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,480
all commits, all comments, and all issues

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,740
came from the community.

00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,950
This is just great.

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:40,650
50%, it's really something that most projects would just love.

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,094
This is just great.

00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:44,010
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: So, it happens for the reason

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,580
because we really value all the pull

00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,830
requests that you are sending.

00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,190
And oftentimes we will prioritize the existing pull

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,960
request over the code that we could as the core members do.

00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,490
Because we really believe in growing this community,

00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,320
this pool of people who can actually hack on the core.

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,160
So keep them coming.

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,557


00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:06,640
LUCAS MIRELMANN: So one thing we want to highlight

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,380
now is what happened with the new releases.

00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,500
What is new, what actually happened the last six months.

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,649
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: OK, so, let's start with the 1.3

00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:21,130
that was announced during the ng-europe.

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,180
And from this moment, we had 14 patch releases.

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,180
And I guess at this point you are really used to the fact

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,420
that every week there is a new release with the fresh set

00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,320
of bug fixes.

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,420
So, in 1.3 you had 14 patch releases like this.

00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,580
They fixed over 90 issues.

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,990
We put some small features without breaking changes

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,060
and the small risk of regressions,

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,911
as well as [INAUDIBLE] of documentation improvements.

00:04:52,911 --> 00:04:57,700
LUCAS MIRELMANN: Yeah, but we not only focus on bug fixes.

00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,310
We really want to have a new version that

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,529
actually not only fixes it but provides new features.

00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:07,070
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Right, so we were not only just fixing bugs.

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,270
In parallel to 1.3 efforts, we were

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,620
working on the new major release with the new features.

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,550
So the 1.4 release candidate is going to be out next week.

00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,965
And it reprints over 650 comments' worth of work.

00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:25,380
And in those comments we've got 35-plus new features.

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,000
I can't give you an exact number,

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,170
because it's still growing.

00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,940
We fixed over 140 bugs, and it got some performance

00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,140
improvements that we are going to talk about in a second.

00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,765
LUCAS MIRELMANN: One thing to highlight

00:05:37,765 --> 00:05:39,720
is that whenever you see a commit,

00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,440
these are high-quality commits.

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,120
I don't know if you can gauge with the report story.

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,730
We take the time to be sure that those commits

00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,920
are high quantity.

00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,730
It's rebase.

00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,100
The numbers really don't show.

00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,544
Those 650 really are high-quality commits.

00:05:56,544 --> 00:05:57,460
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Yeah.

00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,390
So I guess all the people are waiting for the new features,

00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,000
right?

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,990
Let's dive into this.

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,020
LUCAS MIRELMANN: Yeah, so what's new?

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,310
It's what's new with 1.4.

00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,730
So out of 1.4 we want to highlight

00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,445
a few things, a few modules that really make the difference.

00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:16,410


00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,490
One is the new router.

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:26,750
This was Ray, Brad, and Igor said about this.

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,950
Brian said, we'll have a presentation

00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,040
on this later today.

00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,130
The new router really fixes a lot of the issues

00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,970
that you were struggling with.

00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,020
It takes a lot of feedback and a lot of improvements

00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,150
from other projects that also solved this.

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,733
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: All right, so Brad is just speaking after us,

00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:48,410
so just be sure to attend it.

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,290
The next big part of 1.4 is internationalization.

00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,840
So, for many folks that are writing

00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,550
for the applications for the global audience,

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,520
you know that 1.3 is having some possibilities built in

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,410
to help you with those applications.

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,000
But it's still lacking in some areas,

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,310
and translations being one of the most important ones.

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,530
So we are really excited to share that in 1.4 we

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,300
are going to have a comprehensive translation

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,310
solution with hard topics like pluralization or gender

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,220
support tackled properly.

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,410
So [INAUDIBLE] and Pascal are going to give you

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,690
multi-data on this tomorrow.

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,822


00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,280
LUCAS MIRELMANN: Another thing that was completely revamped

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,220
is ng-animate.

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:38,680
Matias did an excellent job in rewriting the existing animate

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
solution.

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,000
He fixes a lot of the existing problems.

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,074
It's a lot more robust, a lot more dynamic.

00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:48,115
It's a lot more flexible.

00:07:48,115 --> 00:07:50,600
And he will have a presentation tomorrow.

00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,575


00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,700
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: All right.

00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,560
So Matias is not only active in the ng-animate model,

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,810
but he also created 1.3, the ng-messages one.

00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,220
And this kind of new model, people

00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,880
loved it from the very beginning and started to use it.

00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,540
And as they used it more and more,

00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,800
the new patterns emerged, and people started to request,

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,320
yeah, I would like to have more includes

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,460
for messages or more dynamic way of matching messages.

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,470
So all those requests were tackled in 1.4.

00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:31,700
So now you can have several sets of messages to be included.

00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,870
You can have matching of those messages

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,419
based on the expressions.

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,309
And one thing that we should really mention

00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,210
is that those new directives are playing very well

00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:46,480
with the built-in ng-repeat and ng-directive, which

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,400
means that you can really create dynamically

00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,200
all the sets of the messages and match them dynamically

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,550
based on the expression.

00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,200
So it gives a lot of flexibility.

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,000
LUCAS MIRELMANN: So, another component

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,922
that needed a lot of love for quite some time is ngCookies.

00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:05,880
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Right.

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,630
So, we had this optional model in AngularJS

00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,085
that isn't very critical, but still people

00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,490
are requesting features for it.

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,560
So 1.4, Shahar stepped in and said, OK, I'm

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,390
going to clean it up and do it more flexible.

00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,790
So he did, and now we can, among other things,

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,210
set path and domain in the cookie.

00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,940
But apart from the features that you can see,

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,270
there were a lot of changes to the internals of this model.

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,930
So, for example, we removed the polling for the cookies.

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,010
So now the entire model should be

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,974
more performant and reliable.

00:09:45,974 --> 00:09:46,890
LUCAS MIRELMANN: Yeah.

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,615
It also closes the oldest and most commented open issue.

00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:53,800
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Yeah, two years old, the issue.

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,660
LUCAS MIRELMANN: And this is just a few.

00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,050
A lot of things happened in 1.4.

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,200
You can actually look at the release notes.

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,970
I hope you actually make very good use of all these features.

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,411


00:10:08,411 --> 00:10:10,910
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Now, I think there are some really exciting

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,610
numbers to share here, right?

00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,110
LUCAS MIRELMANN: So, in Angular 1.4,

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,290
we wanted to work on performance,

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,400
performance in not only the entire application

00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,070
because the broader application's too difficult.

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,130
But one part that is critical is digest times.

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,780
Making digest times as small as possible

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,320
makes the application snappier, modern.

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,830
It feels really-- it's where Angular shines.

00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:45,310
So in 1.4 we stepped in, and we make the digest times

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,340
30% faster than in Angular 1.3.0.

00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,980
So this is very good news.

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,884
[CHEERS]

00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:59,146


00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:01,270
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Right, and Lucas is way too modest

00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,850
to tell you that actually himself with Jason [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,300
did all of those changes.

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,610
So big thank you.

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,050
[CHEERS]

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,890


00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,420
So now with all those new features, bug fixes,

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,850
refactorings, and performance improvements,

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,200
we had to touch a lot of code in the entire code base.

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,350
So how do you feel, Lucas?

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,210
Is it safe to upgrade for people to 1.4?

00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,260
LUCAS MIRELMANN: So all my apps, I always

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,810
run them on top of master.

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,290
So everybody should upgrade as fast as possible.

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,754
This is good.

00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:37,670
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Like living on the edge, man.

00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,660
LUCAS MIRELMANN: Yeah, well, [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,510
We make a lot of effort to make 1.4 easy

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,650
to upgrade for everybody.

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,210
We had very few breaking changes.

00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,020
All of them are well documented, and the upgrade path

00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,130
is very easy.

00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,870
We support the same browsers as we did in 1.3.

00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,560
So it's good.

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,440
I hope that the community drops this as fast as possible.

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,060
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Right, so i9 is still here, right?

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,970
LUCAS MIRELMANN: i9 is still there, yes.

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,900
Also, this implies that the faster you move to 1.4

00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,590
is the core member teams can focus more on 1.4 and 1.5

00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,897
and less time on back porting things to 1.3.

00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:18,730
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: So everyone should upgrade.

00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,550


00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,330
So, I hope that at this point you

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,726
are getting the feel of what has happened in 1.3 and 1.4

00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:27,850
during the last few months.

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,600
Now let's share some plans for the future.

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,880


00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,440
LUCAS MIRELMANN: So, 1.4 is still not out.

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,570
Once 1.4 is out, we will start planning on 1.5.

00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,610
The planning on 1.5 will happen in the open just like 1.4

00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,560
happened.

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,120
You will be able to see what the plans are.

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,710
But one thing that is critical is community feedback.

00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,649
The 1.5 will be shaped based on the community.

00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,940
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Right, so it's really important for us

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,250
that you've got your say in terms of what goes into 1.5.

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,730
So just let us know what is important to

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,850
you, which bugs you want to have fixed,

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,710
which pull requests you want to have merged.

00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,870
So just go to the GitHub and leave a comment.

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,700
It can be +1 or just more elaborate comment.

00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,000
But just simply let us know what is important for you.

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,110
And then while preparing the planning meeting for 1.5,

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,100
we will take all those comments, the most

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,450
commented on issues and pull requests,

00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,330
and we will try to include them as priority.

00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,670


00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,800
LUCAS MIRELMANN: So, one thing that

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,440
is clear to us is that 1.5 will have

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,470
to be a step toward Angular 2.

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,490
This already happened with a few modules.

00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,320
A few modules, they shared the same code base

00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,940
between Angular 1 and Angular 2.

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,044
And 1.5 will continue with this work.

00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:56,960
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Cool.

00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,640


00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,600
LUCAS MIRELMANN: So, you know what?

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,835
Angular 4 is still not out, but when

00:14:07,835 --> 00:14:09,619
is Angular 1.5 going to be out?

00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:12,160
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: So you want me answer the favorite questions

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,868
like [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:15,335
LUCAS MIRELMANN: Yeah, everybody wants to know this.

00:14:15,335 --> 00:14:16,960
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Right, so obviously we

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,010
can't give you any details on 1.5 release date.

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,010
But if you look at the historical data

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,420
on the previous releases, you can

00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,620
see that those, the release cycles

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,430
are getting shorter and shorter.

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,870
So we kind of cut it down from 17 months for 1.2

00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,450
to about five, six months to 1.4.

00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,550
And once again, we can't commit to the exact date,

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,280
but we want to have this trend of shorter releases

00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,344
so we're getting the features faster.

00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:45,010
LUCAS MIRELMANN: So even when we can not

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,150
commit to a release date for 1.5,

00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:51,800
you should expect one to happen this summer, fall time frame.

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,740
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: Cool.

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,940
So, we did a lot in 1.3 and 1.4.

00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,714
But reflecting on how we work, we

00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:01,630
can see that there are still some improvements

00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,960
to the entire process.

00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,620
And actually I think you can help us with this a lot.

00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,790
So, in any popular project like AngularJS

00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,900
that is used in so many different applications for so

00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,850
many different use cases, there is always more work

00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,240
that the core contributors can do.

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,680
And when we were reflecting on how we are spending our time,

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,170
we realized that a lot of it goes

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,432
into trying to reproduce the issues

00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,140
and getting the pull request to the stage

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,970
that they can be merged.

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,900
So we would ask you to help us.

00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,876
And here are the very concrete actions that you can take.

00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:44,500
LUCAS MIRELMANN: So, we know that there

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,710
are a lot of people who want to make Angular even better.

00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,820
And there are people who have very short time.

00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,460
They have their [INAUDIBLE] work.

00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,170
And there are people who have the time

00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,930
and they're willing to put the effort

00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,740
into grading a new feature.

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,400
One think that is key is that whenever you have the time

00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,800
to put work on a near feature is, first,

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,770
it's send an email to Angular dev.

00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:11,280
Ping any of the core contributors.

00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,170
Don't just start typing and say, yeah,

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,340
I'm going to work on this for months,

00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,890
and then it will be great.

00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,340
Because that, it's very inefficient.

00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,570
If you don't get feedback early on, then whatever

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,980
the results are, then it's very hard for the core contributors

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,210
and for you to make this, to actually the effort for you

00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,820
to land it into Angular Core.

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,630
PAWEL KOZLOWSKI: So, likewise for the issues, believe us.

00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,320
We really would love to fix all the issues that

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,450
are open on the GitHub, just fix them all and have

00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,340
the best framework possible.

00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,040
But once again, we realize that we

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,110
are spending a lot of time trying to understand the issue

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,190
and reproduce it.

00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:57,280
So when you see some glitches in your application

00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,360
and you believe that there is a problem in the framework,

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,890
try, please, narrow it down, and attach a Plunker, [INAUDIBLE],

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,030
or a similar like reproduction scenario

00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,369
so we can quickly see and confirm the bug

00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:14,780
and really fix it into the next release.

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,544
Also if you could check if the bug happens still

00:17:18,544 --> 00:17:22,297
on the latest master, it will save us a lot of time.

00:17:22,297 --> 00:17:23,880
LUCAS MIRELMANN: This also is the case

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,430
is if you have the time and you work through the issues

00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,810
and you see that there's some issues that they don't have

00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,550
a revisible scenario, if you can put there, look at it,

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,701
say, yeah, I was able to reduce this.

00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:37,200
Done.

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,810
Here's a Plunker.

00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,890
That will be great.

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,900
That helps us make that fix into the next release

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,940
that it will be one week after and not two or three or five

00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,180
releases after.

00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,200
It really helps us a lot.

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,720
So, with that said, we'd like to thank you

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,600
all for listening to us, and enjoy the conference.

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,050
[APPLAUSE]
