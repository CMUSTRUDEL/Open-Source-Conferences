00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,280
KATYA EAMES: Hi.

00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,290
My name is Katya Eames.

00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,960
I am 16, and I am an Angular developer.

00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,820
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,320


00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,200
[LAUGHS]

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,129


00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,710
So, some of you may know my dad, Joe Eames.

00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,860
He's the funny looking one.

00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,160


00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,432
And he is the one who got me into computer programming.

00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:29,390
When I was in my sophomore year of high school,

00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,430
he made me take a beginning HTML/CSS class,

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,120
and I kind of went along with it, against my will.

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,820
But by the end of the class, I actually

00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,680
really, really enjoyed it, because I'm a nerd, apparently.

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,440
So then I was wondering how I could continue doing this,

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,190
because my school only offered that class.

00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,420
And I saw a pamphlet in my school office for a program

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,365
that they were offering called JATC,

00:00:54,365 --> 00:00:56,840
where I would spend three hours a day,

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,530
all day, all school year, programming.

00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,920
Just learning-- JavaScript would be the last language

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,810
that I would learn.

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,150
But a thing about this class was that it had 100 homework

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,910
assignments that I had to do by the end of the summer.

00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,770
And I hate homework, but doing it over the summer?

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,880
Not my idea of a picnic.

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,320
So my dad gave me a bit of motivation

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,040
and told me that if I did all of the homework by the time summer

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,150
would end, he would buy me my own laptop.

00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,503
So moral of the story--

00:01:31,503 --> 00:01:34,341
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:38,130


00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,010
So skip ahead to about halfway through the first quarter

00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,170
of this JATC class, and I was having

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,260
a bit of a problem with one of my friends.

00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,560
For two years, we had been writing a story together,

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,227
but we had been doing it over text messaging.

00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:54,810
So I would send her part of the story,

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,560
and she would send back part of the story,

00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,660
and then I would have to go through all of my texts,

00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,750
delete the ones that were just part of our daily conversation,

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,833
and then come to realize that I just deleted

00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,160
a giant portion of the story.

00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,949


00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,180
So my dad came to me with an idea of an app

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,304
that we could build using Angular that would take

00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:15,470
care of that problem for me.

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,890


00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,830
This was when I hadn't even learned JavaScript.

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,630
So it sounded a bit crazy, but it actually ended up working.

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,370
But I'll come back to how that happened.

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,380
Skip ahead to halfway through the second quarter of my JATC

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,350
class, and my dad heard about a 12 week programming boot

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,060
camp called DevMountain.

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,810
[CHEERS FROM AUDIENCE]

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,820
Shout out to the head instructor, Tyler McGinnis.

00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,110
So we discussed pulling me out of high school

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,820
to go and do this, and eventually, that's

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,850
what I decided to do.

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,750
So you could say that I'm a bit of a drop-out,

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,266
but I'm in good company.

00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:54,062
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:57,120


00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,850
Now, I want to show you what my dad did

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,590
to help me get interested in learning Angular.

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,020
So over here is our little story editing app.

00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,000
As you can see, it has a title, and this

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,110
used to be just an input box.

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,255
So it was big, bulky, and fugly.

00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:18,760


00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,960
Eventually, we-- and my dad had built, like,

00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,220
everything on this.

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,920
I hadn't done anything except suggest that, hey, the input

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,450
box is ugly.

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,090
It needs to go.

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,920
So we decided to make it a span that when

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,889
we click on it, changes into an input box,

00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:32,680
and when we hit a Done button, it goes back

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,930
to being a read only span.

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,980
And we did that using the ngHide, ngClick,

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,170
and ngShow directives, which he didn't even tell me

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:39,740
were directives.

00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,406
He said, this does this, that does that,

00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:42,820
and I went along with it.

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,050
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,470
So on the title span, we set ng-hide="editing",

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,995
and we set the ng-click on it to "editing = true".

00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:54,725


00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:56,830
Let's see if I can spell it today.

00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,370
And on the input box, we set ng-show to editing.

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,120
And we did the same thing with the button,

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,000
setting ng-show="editing".

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,685
And on the ng-click, we set that to "editing = false".

00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:16,180


00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,611
Apparently I'm unable to connect to application instances, but--

00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:20,493
[LAUGHS]

00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,375
MAN: Green button.

00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,260
Green refresh button.

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,676
KATYA EAMES: Green refresh button?

00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:26,600


00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,665
Technical difficulties.

00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:29,290
But if it was working, I would show you

00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,830
that when I click on the span, it changes into an input box.

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,500
I would change the title to "My Story Title,"

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,990
hit the Done button, it would go back to being a span.

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,760
So using just these few basic things,

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,740
my dad got me really interested in Angular

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,380
because it was a way that was interactive in which I could

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,660
see what my code was doing.

00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,720
So there are three main things that I want

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,450
you to take away from my talk.

00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,720
One is that Angular is a great way

00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,800
to teach your kids programming, because it is very interesting.

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,660
Two, you have to be involved.

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,370
And three, you can teach your kids Angular.

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,160
Thank you.

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,560
[CHEERS FROM AUDIENCE]

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,260


00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,248
[LAUGHS]
