00:00:01,297 --> 00:00:03,130
SPEAKER: That's making us all uncomfortable.

00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,170
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,921
SPEAKER 1: Are we doing the doo-wop group?

00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:06,920
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, we are.

00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,760
Bring your chair up.

00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,750
Bring your chair up just a tiny bit.

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,381
You too, Chuck.

00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:11,130
Just a little bit.

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,495
SPEAKER 1: We want to be able to see each other.

00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:14,578
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, so we can see each other's faces.

00:00:14,578 --> 00:00:17,213
Anthony, are we good up there?

00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:17,905
All right.

00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:18,780
SPEAKER 3: All right.

00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,190
I'm at the end.

00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,148
SPEAKER 2: Have a seat.

00:00:20,148 --> 00:00:22,860
You're the caboose, or the engine.

00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,360
Whichever one.

00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,722
SPEAKER 1: He's the caboose.

00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:28,617
SPEAKER: I want to see you guys.

00:00:28,617 --> 00:00:30,700
SPEAKER: Guys, sorry, I had to get my makeup done.

00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,514
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:00:31,514 --> 00:00:32,430
I'll be in my trailer.

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,070
SPEAKER: (SINGING) In Chapter 1, you

00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,820
tell her you love her with all your heart.

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,370
SPEAKER 2: OK, Chuck?

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,540
You're the guy.

00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,210
Start us off.

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:39,600
SPEAKER 4: All right.

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,950
Hey everybody, and welcome to the Adventures in Angular

00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,730
podcast, live.

00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,149
[CHEERING]

00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:46,505


00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,630
SPEAKER 4: I'm just curious, before we get started,

00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,597
how many of you listen to the show?

00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:52,430
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:52,740
SPEAKER 1: One person.

00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,656
SPEAKER 2: There's hundreds of them out there.

00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:57,380
SPEAKER 1: 50,000 people just raised their hand in unison.

00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,490
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,320


00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,120
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,630
Thank you.

00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,100
That was a courtesy handraise.

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,600
SPEAKER 2: How many people are still

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,975
in here just because they haven't

00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:07,300
bothered to go get lunch yet?

00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,160
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,560
Wow.

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,615
Only one guy raises his hand.

00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,280
That's awesome.

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,980
SPEAKER 4: Don't want to wait in that line.

00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,480
All right.

00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,580
Well, we're going to talk a bit about what we kind of learned

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,440
at the conference and what we think it means going forward

00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,015
for Angular folks.

00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:25,965
[MICROPHONE FEEDBACK]

00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:26,840
SPEAKER: Was that me?

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,702


00:01:28,702 --> 00:01:29,660
SPEAKER: Yeah, be easy.

00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:29,862


00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:31,070
SPEAKER: It's Sunday morning.

00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,890
SPEAKER 4: I'm wondering, what kind of stood out to you guys,

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,910
yesterday and today?

00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,600


00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,465
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:41,840
SPEAKER 3: Well, first, it's just

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,990
a freakin' awesome conference.

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,877
I mean, it is so beautifully run.

00:01:45,877 --> 00:01:47,210
There's so much cool stuff here.

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,230
I'm just blowing smoke your way, my man, over there.

00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,540
And Joe, and all these guys.

00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,510
I mean, you know, you-- exactly.

00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,690
So we've got to get that love moment out of here,

00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,430
because it was really great.

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,422
SPEAKER 1: Thanks, man.

00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,710
I think we have a lot of fun.

00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,080
Like I've slept a total of 180 minutes in the last three days.

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,090
But it's like the adrenaline of the event.

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,970
I don't even really feel tired.

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,776
It's a lot of fun.

00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:15,150
SPEAKER 2: So what makes the event so great, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,760
We've been to hundreds of events.

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,530
What makes this one so great?

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,550
SPEAKER 3: There's a certain kind of enthusiasm

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,020
that's very infectious.

00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,481
There is the common community around a single platform.

00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,230
I love other conferences, too, but there's

00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,146
a diversity of topics.

00:02:31,146 --> 00:02:33,294
Here, everybody's in on one thing.

00:02:33,294 --> 00:02:33,960
They're excited.

00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,689
There's also something to talk about,

00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,230
which is where the platform is going,

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,740
because it's moving so fast.

00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,970
And it's injected, it's larded through with all

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,250
kinds of these sort of fun, little candy

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,786
bits that keep you going.

00:02:47,786 --> 00:02:49,660
SPEAKER 1: Like the Angular 3.0 announcement.

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,770
SPEAKER 3: That was just killer!

00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,060
I mean, who knew that was coming?

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,390
SPEAKER 1: You didn't even see it.

00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,890
SPEAKER 3: I did not see that coming.

00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,140
SPEAKER 1: And we gave a release date, too, which is--

00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,650
SPEAKER 3: Which is really bold.

00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,500
SPEAKER: Way to push the envelope.

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,090
SPEAKER 1: No, I know.

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,550
That's what we're trying to do here.

00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,050
SPEAKER 5: So, I think, for me, what

00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,000
I enjoyed the most is that the people behind Angular,

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,690
the core team and everybody that's

00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,800
made such valuable contributions are actually quite accessible.

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,050
And so I just love just the accessibility of everyone.

00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,430
There's people that I look up to, and I'm learning from.

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,120
And it's like, oh, here's this person in the elevator,

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,139
or standing over here.

00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:22,680
And you can just go up and meet them.

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,210
And I think just that accessibility

00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,930
and that intimacy of everybody's super amped

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,930
to build awesome things.

00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,420
And we are, and we can just meet everybody.

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,920
I don't feel like there's really barriers or walls.

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,000
SPEAKER 1: So I kind of want to talk about that.

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,780
There's a reason that we didn't sell a larger

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,570
quantity of tickets than last year, Lucas,

00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,850
and it's exactly what you're saying.

00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,280
Joe, do you want to talk about it?

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,540
SPEAKER 6: Do I want to talk about which part?

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,130
What do you--

00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,920
SPEAKER 1: Just why we have the tickets down,

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,810
to keep the intimacy.

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,110
SPEAKER 6: Well, that's exactly what Aaron said, right?

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,370
And what Lucas said.

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,740
We want people to be able to have conversations,

00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,464
and we don't want anybody to feel lost in a crowd.

00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:08,130
SPEAKER 4: Yeah.

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,796
One other thing that I've really enjoyed

00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:14,010
is just that the talks are really concise.

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,209
They're all like 20 minutes long,

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,800
and you just move from one to the next

00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
to the next to the next.

00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,258
And you don't want to get up and leave, either, because you

00:04:21,258 --> 00:04:22,370
might win a quadrocopter.

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,960
SPEAKER 1: Right?

00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,640
Or a bacon bowl.

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,310
SPEAKER: Or bacon bowl.

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,226
SPEAKER 4: Bacon bowl!

00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:26,920
I know, right?

00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,150
But the thing for me is just-- I mean, I can sit here,

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,810
and they get right into their topics.

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,820
They give the talk, and then we're

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,904
right into the next thing.

00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:35,569
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:36,950
There's no fluff whatsoever.

00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,040
There's no [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,470
I was born in a log cabin in Tennessee.

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,110
Everything's right to the point.

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,640
You get a lot of good meat here.

00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,020
And some of the talks are only five minutes, too,

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,410
which those I've found to be entertaining.

00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,368
SPEAKER 1: Those ones were great though, right?

00:04:48,368 --> 00:04:49,370
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,226
SPEAKER: True story, bro.

00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:52,890
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,890
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, and what about Shai, yesterday?

00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,120
SPEAKER 1: Oh my gosh.

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,760
Funniest talk I've ever seen.

00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,350
SPEAKER: Ever.

00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,349
SPEAKER: Best live talk I've ever seen for sure.

00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:02,880
SPEAKER 1: I had Misko on one side, two seats this way,

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,751
I had Brad.

00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:05,500
And the whole row, we about died laughing.

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,610
Seriously.

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,190
SPEAKER 2: So what was the name of that talk, for people

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:08,710
who want to go look it up?

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,459
SPEAKER 1: ng-wat.

00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:10,119


00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:10,660
SPEAKER: Wat?

00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,159
Wat?

00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,510
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,725
SPEAKER 5: W-A-T, not W-H-A-T.

00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:17,350
SPEAKER 1: It rules all talks.

00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,270
So two years, zero standing ovations until that talk.

00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,150
I don't think I've been at a tech talk

00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,680
with standing ovation, sans like the Google I/O

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,340
jumping out of a blimp, Google glass facade.

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,840
SPEAKER 5: That's next year, though.

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,423
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, no, that's next year.

00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:34,854
Ng-blimp.

00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:37,020
SPEAKER 6: So I figure Shai is a lock for next year.

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,390
SPEAKER 1: Oh he's-- totally, yeah.

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,530
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,530
SPEAKER 2: So what about some of the content?

00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,090
Like something I really liked with this ng-conf

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,260
compared to the last one-- and part of it's timing.

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,360
Working at a large engine like Google,

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,080
you know that you can't always time

00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,620
an event and a release of a product

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,100
where it's actually a lot of good information to come out.

00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,340
I feel like it was a ton of great new Angular

00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,400
material yesterday and today.

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,290
Would you guys agree?

00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,123
SPEAKER 3: Oh, yeah.

00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:02,330
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,207
Yeah, it's weird to see.

00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:08,290
I've seen a lot of shifts, like almost immediately

00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,480
in people going, oh, cool, let's use TypeScript!

00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,459
And these are people that yesterday were like-- or, hey,

00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:15,750
maybe we should use TypeScript.

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,115
And 48 hours ago, they were like, dude, no--

00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:21,490
SPEAKER: Don't say to the T word.

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,494
SPEAKER 1: Ixnay on the Ypescript-Tay.

00:06:23,494 --> 00:06:25,410
SPEAKER 2: TypeScript, CoffeeScript, AtScript,

00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,720
WatScript, yeah.

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,904
I think the direction is clear now, which is good.

00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:29,570
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,040
I think it's great.

00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,570
I've currently been trying to decide-- I need a transpiler.

00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,790
I need a babel, or I need a tracer,

00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,240
and I need to take it to my app.

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,560
And I've been kind of realizing what that means.

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,150
You're kind of on it forever.

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,760
You don't ever not be on those things.

00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,620
You're never going to not be on Babel.

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,203
You're never going to not be on tracer

00:06:49,203 --> 00:06:50,390
once you're already on it.

00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,950
And TypeScript is exactly like that.

00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,520
And I've kind of been accepting that that's the reality.

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,890
I think TypeScript gives you the most, and I think it's awesome.

00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,480
So I'm kind of excited about that.

00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,020
SPEAKER 2: What I really like about TypeScript when

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,960
I got involved-- and Wally and I got involved

00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,580
in it many years ago-- is it has a promise of keeping

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,820
true to the next versions of JavaScript and Nexus script.

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,940
And that's what I like, is there's not

00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,640
all this sugar on top that's making it more complicated

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,950
and harder to get into.

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,470
It's actually just JavaScript.

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,030
And you can write ES5, and it is valid TypeScript.

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,840
And now doing the annotations into it, to me,

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,030
that's-- I was kind of hesitant last year when I heard about

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,897
the AtScript thing.

00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:29,980
I'm like, I like this, but now there's TypeScript,

00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,620
there's AtScript, there's JavaScript.

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,870
Where are we going?

00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,720
I like this merging.

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,820
SPEAKER 3: Well, and getting back to your point

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,175
about the transpilers, right?

00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:39,800
Those transpilers are just transpilers.

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,340
But what was that that we saw?

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,139
It's tooling that goes with it.

00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,680
I mean, the killer thing there is you're busily typing along,

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,929
and you get that intellisense.

00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,950
I've missed that in JavaScript a long time.

00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,590
And the fact that it plugs into all

00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,390
of the different kinds of IDs that people want to have.

00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,792
So it's putting all these pieces together,

00:07:57,792 --> 00:08:00,250
and I'm not even having to think about the transpiler stuff

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:00,809
like that.

00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:03,350
And then, when you look at the JavaScript code that it emits,

00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,030
and that's JavaScript code that I would like to write.

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,230
So all in all, it just seems to me to be more comprehensive

00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,800
and reduce the friction I'm going to have as a developer.

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:11,960
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,360
And if you don't want classes, you

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,651
don't have to use them any-- you don't want interfaces?

00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:16,560
You don't have to.

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,760
So there's opt-in pieces.

00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,234


00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:20,900
SPEAKER 4: That's the thing that Misko keeps getting up on stage

00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,040
and saying is, if you want to just go ES6, great.

00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,450
If you want ES5, great.

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:25,950
You know?

00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,380
But if you want these other things

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,970
that we're breaking into TypeScript with Angular,

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,512
there you go.

00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,428
SPEAKER 5: Well, and one thing that I can even

00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:35,262
appreciate about that messaging is

00:08:35,262 --> 00:08:37,720
I think it's just even improved over the last couple months

00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,350
with, look, it's not this way or the highway.

00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,330
We're not going to go kill things that-- just

00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,550
even I feel that, just the keynotes for me,

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,540
I felt really reassured about where Angular was going.

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,840
I felt like everybody just got a big old hug,

00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,620
including the [INAUDIBLE] guys, which was actually pretty cool.

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,661
And I'd like to see more collaboration and a more

00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:55,600
inclusive community.

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,010
And so I think not only am I excited about the language,

00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,110
but just the overall mindset.

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,550
And just messaging, I think they took a lot of feedback,

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,066
and they've really improved that to their benefit.

00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,190
SPEAKER 2: I totally agree.

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,490
The messaging that they came out with yesterday,

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,770
it was like a hook.

00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,647
There was so much content about, yeah, here's Angular 2,

00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:16,730
and it's going to be here.

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,620
But you don't have to jump right on it.

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,720
They're going to provide this bridge, these rails,

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,100
to continue on with 1.X until they

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,242
said-- I think the majority of people

00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:27,450
have moved over to Angular 2?

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,400
Then they'll start thinking about it.

00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,210
SPEAKER 1: So talking about TypeScript a little bit more.

00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,190
I'm pretty excited about it.

00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:41,340
One of the things that I think it gives us is it

00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,970
gives the Angular community an ability to affect the TC39.

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,380
Because among TypeScript users, the Angular community

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,570
will be the largest.

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,280
Like undoubtedly, right?

00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,030
And you can't get into the TC39 without some sort

00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,570
of factual in-field evidence that this is the thing that

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,150
helped, and we liked it.

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,530
So getting Angluar, that's like the biggest horse

00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,092
that TypeScript could have probably fasted itself to.

00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:09,800
SPEAKER 2: Right.

00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,810
SPEAKER 1: And so fasting that to Angular

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,550
and giving Angular this cutting edge

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,330
thing with unsupported syntax will help us say, hey,

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,540
we want this in the language, as well.

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,575
And the TC39 is going to have to see that we're using it,

00:10:23,575 --> 00:10:25,790
and like watch the results, and react.

00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,980
So it gives us a larger voice in the higher level community,

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,530
not just in the user community.

00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:31,980
SPEAKER 3: Right.

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,146
And it's not just a Microsoft thing, anymore, right?

00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:35,907
Which gets everybody holding their nose.

00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:37,490
Yeah, you know that Google's lined up.

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,073
Who else knows who's going to line up?

00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:41,267
But it has stopped being, oh, that's just that thing

00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:42,350
that Microsoft offered us.

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,480
SPEAKER: Yeah, I have to say--

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,320
SPEAKER 4: You heard it hear first, right?

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,360
ES8, optional typing.

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,860
SPEAKER 2: That's the amazing thing.

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,820
You step back and look at-- if somebody

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,090
said to you a couple months ago that Microsoft and Google were

00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,020
going to collaborate in a three month time span

00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,730
to merge these concepts together so these could work together,

00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,157
I mean, people think you're nuts!

00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:03,240
SPEAKER: Hashtag whatever.

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,810
SPEAKER 2: I mean, it's amazing how--

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,920
they both must have gave on both sides to think of that story.

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,074
SPEAKER: True story, bro.

00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:11,240
SPEAKER 3: I mean, when they came out with AtScript,

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,950
last year, I was just crestfallen.

00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,420
Because it looked like browser wars

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,480
trasnported to the JavaScript language.

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,832
And now, we were going to have to face-- and by the way,

00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:23,790
all the people who are looking for a way to say

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,480
don't get into client side programming,

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,359
we're grasping at these kinds of things.

00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:29,400
They said, see, see, see?

00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,149
They're all going all their separate ways.

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,310
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,410
SPEAKER 3: Yeah, flavor of the week.

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,035
Da da da da da.

00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:34,710
You know?

00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,001
So for these guys to come together and say, no, no, no,

00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:38,640
we're going to consolidate.

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,056
We're going to bring our interests

00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:42,120
together again so we have something

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,110
we can all get behind.

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,420
That's great.

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,711
SPEAKER 2: It's not just words.

00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:47,130
That's what I like, is they keep saying, let's reach out,

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,310
let's end this controversy between Ember and React

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,349
and all these guys.

00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:52,890
But it's not just words, it's action.

00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,110
That's what I like.

00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,400
SPEAKER 5: Testify!

00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,280
SPEAKER 1: Can I have an amen.

00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,150
Amen, brother!

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,480
SPEAKER 4: But that's the other thing, you know,

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,610
when we're talking about AtScript versus TypeScript.

00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,230
And now they brought that together.

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,730
But then, they talked about how they

00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,820
brought in people from Ember CLI and some

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,820
of these other projects.

00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,910
And they're using a lot of these same concepts,

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,890
and a lot of the same code, to get stuff done.

00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,560
And they're saying, look, there really

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,510
isn't this animosity between them.

00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,400
Use what you want, and we're all going

00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,810
to raise the bar on everything together so that you

00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,310
can build your apps the way you want to build them.

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,030
And I find that, in a lot of cases,

00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,410
people get really-- really get attached to Angular or Ember

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,700
or whatever.

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,280
And then they get disappointed because Ember doesn't have

00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,530
this feature that Angular has.

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,560
But if the performance comes up on all of them,

00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,870
if everything comes up on all of them, then the web gets better,

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,930
our lives all get better, and we can collaborate with people

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,520
and learn things from people that we

00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,163
wouldn't be able to before.

00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:54,496
SPEAKER 5: That was really deep.

00:12:54,496 --> 00:12:56,590
SPEAKER 3: So the other really-- for me,

00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,550
really important thing that happened here,

00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,820
was to revisit the migration story

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,430
and the relative importance of development in Angular 1

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,236
dot anything and 2.0.

00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:13,360
Because it was very hard for them to articulate how

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,094
wonderful 2.0 is without casting a shadow over 1.

00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:17,510
And I think that they had a chance

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,550
to rethink that and do two things.

00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,236
One, to reemphasize how great 1.X is,

00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,610
and how that continues to evolve as long as the community

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,840
wants to drive it.

00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,952
So if somebody comes to me today and says, 2.0 is not here,

00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:32,410
and 1.0 is going to be remaindered,

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,260
I guess I should sit on my hands and do nothing, I say, no!

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,900
1.X is great stuff.

00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,120
You should start there.

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,060
It's got conceptual--

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,860
SPEAKER 5: Amen.

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,760
SPEAKER 3: --conceptual continuity of 1 to 2.

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,934
Syntax is different, but conceptual continuity.

00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:48,100
You can get started today in 1, even if you've never

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,300
done anything and you're on a great road.

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
SPEAKER 2: And the router is the first tangible aspect of that

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,008
that you can use.

00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:54,644
The ng- new, new, new router.

00:13:54,644 --> 00:13:56,300
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,679
SPEAKER 4: Love that router.

00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,970
SPEAKER 3: The Animate 2 stuff.

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,160
That animate stuff from [INAUDIBLE] was fantastic.

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,840
So they really brought that home.

00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,460
Secondly, they talked substantively

00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,070
about the migration story.

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,750
You've got to go look at the keynote

00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,727
and realize that it's not all big bang.

00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,310
I don't have to throw everything away.

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,750
They've got roadmaps.

00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,190
We've got road maps for figuring out

00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:22,480
how to take an existing application that is mostly 1

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,989
and get it where we need it to be if it's a desktop app.

00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,780
SPEAKER 1: So in the past we heard him say,

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,722
you will be able to migrate.

00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:31,180
But I feel like I saw it this time.

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,346
SPEAKER 3: Saw it, because--

00:14:32,346 --> 00:14:32,362


00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:33,820
SPEAKER 1: I was always like, well,

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,510
how do they both live on the same page?

00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,720
How is a new ng-repeat going to work with an old one?

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,134
Well, today, we saw they're completely different.

00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:42,550
So they can live on the same page.

00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,740
SPEAKER 3: They're going to live on the same page.

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,780
SPEAKER 1: So it's not a complete rewrite

00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,070
of your app to go to 1 to 2.

00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,391
You could rewrite it in bits.

00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:51,640
You can rewrite today this one, tomorrow the next one.

00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,210
And Brian Ford had that great graphic

00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,640
where he showed you rewriting piecelets of your app

00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,370
from the 1 to the new.

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:03,570
And so that, for me, it made me feel better about,

00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,580
there will be a migration path, as opposed

00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,960
to forcing us do a full rewrite.

00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,150
SPEAKER 3: That's killer.

00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,834
Then there's another thing, all right,

00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:13,250
that has to do with the migration,

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,740
which I think is critical, was what kind of investment

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,700
are they making here?

00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,255
First, you've got Pete running 1.

00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:19,880
So they got a member of their own kind.

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,300
They didn't just like outsource 1 development.

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,240
It's still part of the Angular team that's surrounding it.

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,170
Secondly, they're putting Igor-- Igor is taking it

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,265
on himself to make sure that there's a migration path.

00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:31,890
SPEAKER: Right.

00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,473
SPEAKER 3: So they didn't just like hand it down to an intern.

00:15:34,473 --> 00:15:37,030
They gave it to one of the founders of the product

00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,570
to make sure that we have our answers

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,390
as we try to figure out how to cross over.

00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,100
SPEAKER 2: And they've thought about how

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,390
to measure all this stuff, too, which is really important.

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:45,730
SPEAKER 3: Bingo.

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,080
Yeah, and then they're enlisting people in the community

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,345
to start building migration mapping,

00:15:50,345 --> 00:15:52,720
begin talking about how we're going to get from one place

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,430
to another.

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,810
And I'm sure that the evolution path for 1 itself, right-- 1.5,

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,600
1.6-- is all about how can I keep your 1 goodness

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,774
but get you moving in such a way that that translation is there.

00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:08,190
For business developers-- I don't want to talk enterprise,

00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,740
I want to talk business.

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,540
Small companies also make these long term investments.

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,170
They've got to know that they can hold it,

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,070
and then they can get there incrementally to the new place.

00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,550
Otherwise, they're not touching it.

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,110
SPEAKER: Not wasting their money.

00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,410
SPEAKER 4: Well, the other thing with the migration

00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,497
and the reasons for migration, it comes down

00:16:25,497 --> 00:16:27,330
to we know what you're trying to do with it,

00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,850
we know what you wish it did better.

00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,550
We know where some of the barriers to entry are.

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,710
And so we're going to eliminate as much of that stuff as we can

00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,840
and make things better for you that way.

00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,600
And so then as you move up from 1.3 to 1.4 to 1.5 to 1.6,

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,830
and you find that you still have those issues,

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,170
or you want to avoid some of the things that 2.0 solves for you,

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,220
then it's an easier transition just

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,927
to move up and take advantage of it.

00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:56,010
SPEAKER 1: Go ahead, John.

00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,570
SPEAKER 2: Sorry, I just wanted to say, again,

00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,930
just stepping back for a moment and thinking

00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,596
about this conversation, which is great,

00:17:00,596 --> 00:17:01,820
and I agree with all of it.

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,111
Again, you look back three or four months ago, and what

00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:06,310
was the community spirit?

00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,699
It was there's not going to be a 1.4.

00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:09,740
There's not going to be--

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,550
SPEAKER 1: The sky is falling!

00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,050
SPEAKER 2: The whole sky is falling.

00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,078
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:16,369
SPEAKER 2: Heaven forbid JavaScript is going to change.

00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,374
And nothing else changes in this industry except for Angular,

00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:18,829
right?

00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,880
It's the one that's changing.

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,079
SPEAKER: It's the only thing that's ever changed.

00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,379
SPEAKER 2: But it's just a different spirit

00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:23,430
and a different attitude.

00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,119
And I honestly feel like the message was the same,

00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,569
it's just they did it better.

00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,650
I don't think these guys changed their minds.

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,090
I got the impression that this was just more well thought out.

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,030
SPEAKER 6: And more information, as well.

00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,520
And not so much darkness, not so much lack of knowledge.

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,189
But actually, yes, we are-- this is important.

00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:43,730
SPEAKER 4: Well, they showed us code.

00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,291
So you're looking at it and you're

00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,980
going, OK, that makes sense.

00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,817
Given what I know about Angular 1,

00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,150
that makes sense with Angular 2.

00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,483
SPEAKER 1: We're going to some more code this afternoon.

00:17:52,483 --> 00:17:57,460
Dave Smith, he's got some benchmarks between Angular 1.X

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,730
to React, and then he's going to even drop some other bombs

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,640
from React to 2.0 that may surprise a lot of people.

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,150
And so, that was awesome.

00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,940
I want to go back to your whole migration story

00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,660
that you were excited about.

00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,070
I liked that they gave us their--

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,990
explained to us their strategy to gauge

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,920
when will we taper off 1.X?

00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,820
And they're like, hey, in your js.org is Angular 1.X.

00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,470
And Angular.io, this is Angular 2.

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,930
And there's two different sites.

00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,930
We're going to use GitHub and the traffic on these two sites

00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:36,380
to gauge when we're ready to taper off of 1.X

00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,080
and when we're ready to put more people onto 2.0.

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,640
And so it's pretty cool to see them--

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,744
like they explained to us, oh, as long

00:18:43,744 --> 00:18:45,160
as I keep downloading it and using

00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,670
the Docs, that's my voicing, please keep this going.

00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,377
So it's pretty cool that they told us

00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:52,960
we're going to listen to you this way,

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,750
this is how you make us hear you.

00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,790
So I think that should make people feel better.

00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,665
SPEAKER 3: It should.

00:18:57,665 --> 00:18:59,870
And think about what else that says.

00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,650
That says we're not jamming 2.0 down your throat, right?

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,980
Because no, no, no.

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,200
We have to win your hearts.

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,769
You can stay 1.X, until we win the community, with 1.X.

00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:11,560
SPEAKER: Well said.

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,140


00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,590
SPEAKER 6: So I think I'd like to switch a little bit

00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:20,670
and talk maybe about events and stuff.

00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,250
So who went to anything on Wednesday?

00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,710
The pre-conference day?

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,352
Workshops, hack night?

00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:28,470
Lucas?

00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,920
SPEAKER 5: I was teaching, sorry.

SPEAKER 2: That's all you were doing on Wednesday.

00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,460
SPEAKER 5: Just running my mouth.

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,710
SPEAKER 6: Did anybody go Wednesday night to anything?

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,480
SPEAKER: I did.

00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,160
SPEAKER 2: I don't know what I did this morning, much less

00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,300
Wednesday, at this point.

00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:40,925
SPEAKER: Right.

00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:42,210
So Wednesday was workshops.

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,327
Wednesday night was a lot of different things.

00:19:44,327 --> 00:19:45,410
What did you go to, Lucas?

00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,630
SPEAKER 5: I was speaking.

00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,680
SPEAKER 6: You were speaking.

00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,307
SPEAKER 3: I went to the Aaron Frost 3:00 AM in the morning,

00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:53,140
I'm really tired, and I'm still working on--

00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,640

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,821
SPEAKER 1: Technically, that was Tuesday, though.

00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,790
He asked Wednesday.

00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,400
SPEAKER 3: Oh!

00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,816
SPEAKER 6: Yeah, that was Tuesday.

00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:02,030
SPEAKER 3: Wow, it's a blur.

00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,485
SPEAKER 6: All right.

00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:05,190
So I didn't know we needed to go all the way back to Tuesday

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,825
to talk about Tuesday's ng-conf events.

00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:09,700
SPEAKER 1: I'm lost..

00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,610
No, I said Tuesday?

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,783
I'm so tired, I meant Thursday.

00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:14,550
SPEAKER: Oh, oh.

00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,716
SPEAKER: Get some rest, bro.

00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,414
SPEAKER: Tuesday was dinner and a movie.

00:20:17,414 --> 00:20:18,580
SPEAKER 3: Oh, that's right.

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,000
SPEAKER 2: So I have to ask.

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,650
I didn't know this up front, and I'll claim ignorance

00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,130
for just being an old guy.

00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,307
Walking around, there's a narwhal, a wizard, a shrimp?

00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:28,890
SPEAKER 1: No.

00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,750
A spectral lobster.

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,000
SPEAKER 2: A spectral lobster.

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,780
I didn't up on the relationship until about a day and a half

00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,530
into the event of what those things meant.

00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,550
You want to explain to everybody what these odd looking

00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,210
creatures mean?

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,390
SPEAKER 6: So for anybody that's gone and looked

00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,100
at the change log for Angular, they

00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,072
name each release with these crazy whacked out names.

00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:46,780
SPEAKER 1: Well, they're superhero names.

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,670
So they're not crazy whacked out.

00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,320
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:49,820
A lobster?

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,002
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,460
SPEAKER 6: If that's your story, I'll let you go with that.

00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,418
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:20:56,418 --> 00:20:58,360
SPEAKER 5: If it helps you sleep at night, OK.

00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,800
SPEAKER: I had to have somebody explain it to me.

00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,430
SPEAKER 1: So we have a narwhal, because there was a release

00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,600
called prophetic-narwhal.

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,210
And we have a wizard on stilts, because there was

00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,540
a release called wizard-props.

00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:16,280
And we actually missed the point on unicorn hydrafication.

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,470
We thought it was like a--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,348
SPEAKER: It's a secret.

00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:20,367
Don't tell anybody here.

00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,700
SPEAKER 1: We thought it was liquefying a unicorn, but--

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,340
SPEAKER: Hydra.

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,755
SPEAKER 1: Hydra, with multiple headed unicorns.

00:21:25,755 --> 00:21:27,963
SPEAKER 6: So there's a spelling difference in there.

00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:30,540
Hydrification with an "I", H-Y-D-R-I, is about water.

00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,000
Hydrafication with an "A" obviously means multiple heads.

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,850
SPEAKER 1: Hashtag English.

00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,920
I was wondering why I had a unicorn jumping out

SPEAKER 5: I feel bad for the poor lobster, actually.

00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,265
I went and got in ahead and said, tell me what you are!

00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,515
He was like, I can't tell you!

00:21:49,515 --> 00:21:51,390
Go talk to Sonny!

00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,434
So now I know.

00:21:52,434 --> 00:21:53,850
SPEAKER 6: So is that all of them?

00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,120
SPEAKER 1: Well, the spooky-giraffe.

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,740
SPEAKER: Spooky-giraffe?

00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,330

SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,828
SPEAKER 1: I think that's it.

00:22:00,828 --> 00:22:03,130
The prophetic-narwhal, the special lobster.

00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:03,820
SPEAKER: There were stickers.

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,910
SPEAKER: They were dancing on this stage last night.

00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,160
SPEAKER: So which one are you?

00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,230

SPEAKER 6: All right, so one thing that

00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,330
surprised me about Wednesday was we organized some open spaces.

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,240
And it was kind of last minute.

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,760
I threw it together, sent a bunch of emails.

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,490
And I kind of expected to not see much participation.

00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,340
I showed up at 7:45, and like this one room was full.

00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,950
There was like 30 people around a circle

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,460
of chairs of about 10 people talking

00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,440
about-- I think it was testing.

00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,070
And I was really surprised to see that, wow, a ton of people

00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,960
had gone up there because they were topics they really

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,990
wanted to talk about.

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,800
So I really like that, and I hope that we

00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,740
can expand upon that next year.

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,630
The opportunity for people to say,

00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,200
this is a topic I want to talk about.

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,980
I know there's tons of awesome talks

00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,100
that are going to be there, and they're probably

00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,540
going to address a lot of my concerns,

00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,960
but this is a topic I specifically

00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,780
want to talk about.

00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,620
So they just name the topic, and anybody

00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,245
that wants to talk about that shows up.

00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:03,300
So I got in a conversation about keeping up

00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,400
to date with Angular 2.

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,330
And David East gave some great information about that.

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,163
Another conversation about getting your kids

00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:09,449
interested in programming.

00:23:09,449 --> 00:23:10,490
I had a really good time.

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,460
SPEAKER 2: The kids' track was great.

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,450
I really like that you guys do that.

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,770
SPEAKER 6: Yeah, and that was another new thing this year,

00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,935
was the kids' track.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:22,784


00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:24,450
SPEAKER: So much better than we thought.

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,520
Did you even think it would be like this?

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,350
SPEAKER 1: No, we had approaching 10,000 people.

00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,070
Like we do today have--

00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,960
SPEAKER: 29 countries.

00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,860
SPEAKER 1: Over 27 countries.

00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,820
Yeah, the organizers have been amazing,

00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,850
getting sponsors on their own to pay for T-shirts, and food,

00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,900
and just organizing.

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,980
We hung out live with Poland and with DC,

00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,490
but they're just all over.

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,504
I mean, there's one that looks like it's

00:23:52,504 --> 00:23:54,670
in the middle the ocean, but it's the Canary Islands

00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,330
off of Africa, right?

00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,730
SPEAKER 6: So these are organized events

00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,630
for internal or other external people to come to.

00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,340
And that's on top of just people that just tune into the stream,

00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,970
because they're sitting at work and want to watch the stream.

00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,480
SPEAKER 3: It's overwhelming.

00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,350
So overwhelming that I had to check myself into your child

00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,580
care section in there.

00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,880
I had to go in there and play with some Lego blocks

00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,130
just to decompress.

00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:21,530
SPEAKER 1: You're not allowed within 300 yards of the ng.

00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,360
SPEAKER: I think that got expunged from his record.

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,837
SPEAKER 6: So I want to switch again and ask

00:24:27,837 --> 00:24:29,670
everybody go through and say, so far, what's

00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,930
your favorite moment?

00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,420
The moment you'll remember so far from the conference?

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,110
Aaron, start with you.

00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,890
SPEAKER 1: I'm on the spot.

00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,320
I'm on the wheel.

00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,260
Shai's talk.

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,947
I've never really seen a standing ovation.

00:24:43,947 --> 00:24:45,530
SPEAKER 6: And I don't know about you.

00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,460
I was a little nervous about Shai's talk.

00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,620
The wat thing is a big bar to live up to.

00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,900
SPEAKER 1: When we picked it, we were like, hey,

00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,282
it's got to be amazing.

00:24:55,282 --> 00:24:56,490
You can't limp into this one.

00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,460
SPEAKER 6: It was an unknown.

00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,251
SPEAKER 1: So we hoped it would be awesome,

00:24:59,251 --> 00:25:01,030
and the dude exceeded the delivery.

00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,792
It was just top notch.

00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,750
And he ended it with like a real loving embrace

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,810
to the community, right?

00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,990
SPEAKER 2: Well, I think the case of Red Bull

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,600
that he drank right before that was helpful, too.

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,480
SPEAKER 1: Well, he didn't sleep the night before,

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,430
so I don't know what he was on.

00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,800
SPEAKER 5: Note to self, go drink Red Bull immediately.

00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,250
SPEAKER 6: Chuck, how about you?

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,290
SPEAKER: It was amazing.

00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,550
SPEAKER 4: So I think one of the things that really stood out

00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,890
to me was during the keynote yesterday

00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,510
morning when they showed the performance.

00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,850
I don't even remember what it was for-- table scrolling,

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,510
something.

00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,740
I'm not even sure if I knew what it meant.

00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,890
But they showed the linear progression

00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,770
with however many you have.

00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,770
And then, it's like, and then we made it better.

00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,070
And then, if you use the-- I think

00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,930
it was immutable state or caching--

00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,660
it was like constant time, right?

00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,300
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,460
SPEAKER 4: Order one, yeah.

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,550
It that's amazing.

00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,280
I mean, all of the things that we are learning as a JavaScript

00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,000
community are things that the core team is embracing.

00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,960
And we're going to get it.

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,004
And that was exciting for me.

00:26:03,004 --> 00:26:03,795
SPEAKER 6: Awesome.

00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:04,295
John?

00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:05,390
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, I agree.

00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,790
For me, a lot of it is the community.

00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,840
So I got to see a lot of old friends at this show.

00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,690
You guys, here.

00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,620
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,480
SPEAKER 2: We haven't met before, personally, Charles.

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,771
This is the first time we've actually met face to face.

00:26:16,771 --> 00:26:18,771
But also, meeting people like Dan Whaleen again,

00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:20,187
and some of these guys I don't get

00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:21,710
to see unless I'm at the circuits.

00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,040
And new friends, too.

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,749
We've had a lot of new people, like Shai.

00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,289
Had breakfast with him the other day.

00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:27,010
It was great.

00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,760
And so to me, a lot of the values of the events

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,600
is the connections I get to make with people less so

00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,970
than the sessions.

00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,070
Sorry, but it's the people.

00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,982
SPEAKER 6: No, that's awesome.

00:26:37,982 --> 00:26:39,440
As organizers, we love hearing that

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,210
as much as we love hearing anything else.

00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,540
We spend a lot of time.

00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,436
We want the sessions to be awesome,

00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,740
but we also want people to connect,

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,390
and we want to fun to be awesome.

00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,530
SPEAKER 2: And even the people who aren't here,

00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,488
like the people on Twitter, on the live stream,

00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:52,024
I keep hearing the feedback over the social media

00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:52,940
about this conference.

00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,950
And it's going well.

00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,410
SPEAKER 1: So JP, if you thought this year was great,

00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,770
next year, we got a plan in the works

00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:05,190
to enhance what you just said by a lot.

00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,229
To attack that way majorly.

00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:09,270
It's going to be awesome.

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,880
SPEAKER: You heard it here first.

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,800
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,715
SPEAKER 1: Ng-conf 2016 is going to be what you just said--

00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:15,650
SPEAKER: You heard the vaguest comment ever here first.

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,820
SPEAKER 1: --really, really, really amped up.

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,320
SPEAKER 4: Along the lines of the talking about the extended

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,260
thing, I ran into a few local folks that I know.

00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,420
And I'm like, so you're here at the conference?

00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,950
And they're like, no, I was going to the extended,

00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,730
and I came over here to see what was going on.

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,880
And so it's really coming through just how awesome

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,510
this is.

00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,140
SPEAKER: Lucas?

00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,900
SPEAKER 5: So I'm just going to piggyback on what John said.

00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,920
It's just, I think, just meeting everybody.

00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,240
I've met hundreds and hundreds of great, interesting people.

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,267
And I'm going to be giving a talk about it

00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,100
this afternoon, about just not being afraid,

00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,240
putting yourself out there.

00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,070
And so I write a lot of blog posts.

00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,240
And every time I hit Publish, it's like, oh,

00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,060
this is so stupid.

00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,970
Like why am I doing this?

00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:57,285
Publish.

00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:57,600
Oh!

00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,055
Like I hope this doesn't blow up.

00:27:59,055 --> 00:27:59,700
SPEAKER 1: They're all going to laugh at you!

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,650
SPEAKER 5: They're all going to laugh at me.

00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,180
But it's really just awesome to hear people.

00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,180
Like hey, I had this problem, and you wrote this blog post,

00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,430
and it saved me hours of time.

00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,970
And so just that interaction of just realizing like I'm

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,510
not living in a vacuum, but people--

00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,475
that I have friends out there that actually enjoy things

00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:14,100
that I put out.

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,225
And I get even good feedback of like this thing was

00:28:16,225 --> 00:28:17,220
good, but not so great.

00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,950
And you can actually get those feedback loops.

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,680
So just meeting everybody has been awesome.

00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,096
SPEAKER 1: Maybe there's just other people in your vacuum.

00:28:23,096 --> 00:28:24,638
Yeah, that's-- we're all in a vacuum.

00:28:24,638 --> 00:28:27,054
SPEAKER 2: This profession, I think what you're saying is,

00:28:27,054 --> 00:28:29,590
it's no longer a profession for total introverts, right?

00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,715
It gives an opportunity for introverts to be social

00:28:31,715 --> 00:28:33,030
and to talk.

00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,454
And I think it's great.

00:28:34,454 --> 00:28:37,120
SPEAKER 4: Well, and I don't get that, because I'm a freelancer.

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,050
I work at home, by myself.

00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,050
And so this is terrific that way, too.

00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,010
SPEAKER 6: Awesome.

00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,260
For me, this is not going to come as any big surprise.

00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,718
Although I could probably name five

00:28:46,718 --> 00:28:50,020
experience that I believe I will remember all of my life, loved

00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,060
[INAUDIBLE] last night.

00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,927
Her performance was so awesome.

00:28:52,927 --> 00:28:54,260
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, that was crazy.

00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,259
SPEAKER 6: But, of course, for me, the highlight

00:28:56,259 --> 00:28:57,850
was getting to see my daughter speak.

00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,954
The dad in me got a little bit misty.

00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:01,620
SPEAKER 1: Dude.

00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,970
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] right now?

00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,470
SPEAKER 1: I don't even know her very well, your daughter.

00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,050
I've seen her a couple times.

00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,170
I teared up.

00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,040
Because she was like doing tribute to my dad,

00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,447
and it was pretty cool.

00:29:11,447 --> 00:29:13,280
SPEAKER 2: It was just awesome, man, really.

00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:13,600
SPEAKER 6: Thank you.

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,250
I've had so many people like on Twitter

00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,375
say the same thing, like I actually got emotionally

00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:20,140
affected seeing your daughter up there speaking,

00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,419
and it inspired me for whatever.

00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:24,710
SPEAKER 2: She's becoming a role model for young girls.

00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,418
And as a father of three young daughters,

00:29:26,418 --> 00:29:28,770
it's something that I want them to watch, too,

00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,460
to see what they can do.

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,350
SPEAKER 4: Well, yeah, and it gets you excited about, OK,

00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,090
so she's been doing this for a few years

00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,040
now, when can I get my kids involved?

00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,380
At 10, or 12, or 14?

00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,090
SPEAKER 6: Yeah.

00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:41,700
Yeah.

00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,290
And I love the fact that she was able to show something

00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,420
that very few people would think is possible,

00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,370
which is, hey, normally it's like you've got to learn HTML,

00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,910
CSS, then some JavaScript.

00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,492
And then, maybe, after a while, you

00:29:52,492 --> 00:29:54,450
can start doing something complex like Angular.

00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,250
And it's like, no, you can start off

00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,380
with something really crazy, because you can show kids,

00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,214
get them interested.

00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:00,879
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:03,400
The ng-show/hide concept is simple, your daughter was like,

00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,150
oh.

00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:04,560
SPEAKER 6: Yeah.

00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,726
SPEAKER 1: That makes sense.

00:30:05,726 --> 00:30:07,300
SPEAKER 6: Yeah.

00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,801
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:07,801 --> 00:30:10,091
SPEAKER 3: Well, I have to say that was one of the most

00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:11,510
affecting moments for me, too.

00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:16,910
And Shai was the big production, but your daughter,

00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,440
her presentation meant a lot to me.

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,470
And I hope it encourages people out there.

00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,720
So I agree with what everybody else said.

00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,440
So I'll go back to tech.

00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,690
I was very interested in Misko's talk on data binding.

00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,860
There has been a tremendous amount of concern

00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,036
about the change, and how it is that you mark up the templates,

00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:40,660
and all the things that are going away,

00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,450
and what seemed to be crazy new syntax.

00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,160
I thought this is something that people should go view his talk

00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,880
and see what's behind the changes.

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,950
Because I felt a lot better about them.

00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,410
Still one thing that's been bothering me.

00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,990
So I hate to be Debbie Downer, but it's still bothering me.

00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,620
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,670
SPEAKER 6: You've never been known to pull a punch.

00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:03,060
SPEAKER 3: I've got to throw one.

00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,568
SPEAKER 1: And we're out of time.

00:31:04,568 --> 00:31:06,002
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:06,958
SPEAKER: Cut!

00:31:06,958 --> 00:31:08,250
SPEAKER: That's the show!

00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,559
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:11,100
SPEAKER 2: To clarify, you're talking

00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,145
about the upsetness people had over what's going

00:31:14,145 --> 00:31:15,270
on in two-way data binding?

00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,380
SPEAKER 3: Well, that's where I'm going now.

00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,340
Because they still didn't really talk.

00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,390
They've been dancing around two-way data binding.

00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,720
They danced through it this whole time in this session.

00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,424
They still didn't talk about it.

00:31:25,424 --> 00:31:26,840
SPEAKER 2: We saw everything else.

00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,890
SPEAKER 3: We saw everything else.

00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,420
And so, if you look at all these demos, and these 2.0 demos,

00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,302
there's very, very little user input.

00:31:32,302 --> 00:31:34,010
Now, I don't know how you folks out there

00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,710
in the audience are using Angular,

00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,230
but most of the time, the applications that I'm

00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,930
engaged in are forms over data type apps, where somebody

00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,085
has to type something in.

00:31:42,085 --> 00:31:42,710
SPEAKER: Right.

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,585
SPEAKER 3: All right.

00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:45,620
Now, so let's be clear.

00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,900
If they're killing two-way data binding, I don't care,

00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,400
and neither should anybody else.

00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,610
The problem is not-- we don't build applications

00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,350
to have two-way data binding, but we do build applications

00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,980
to take user input.

00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,550
How are they going to do that?

00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,700
They didn't really talk about that substantively.

00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,077
I know what I don't want to see, which

00:32:04,077 --> 00:32:05,660
is what I've seen in other frameworks,

00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,910
where you have to go through a lot of serous,

00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:12,857
a lot of manipulation, just to attach to each single control.

00:32:12,857 --> 00:32:14,190
Because that ain't going to fly.

00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,648
SPEAKER 2: You've got to figure out

00:32:15,648 --> 00:32:18,110
which event to tie it to, recognize the changes, no, no.

00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,250
SPEAKER 3: I don't want to hear that,

00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,920
so they've got to come up with something.

00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,190
SPEAKER 6: There's some awesome feedback,

00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,820
is that people want to see, hey, show me a working form.

00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,640
SPEAKER 3: Show me some form stuff.

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,505
Show it to me.

00:32:27,505 --> 00:32:30,074
SPEAKER 2: And I think they can do that pretty easily.

00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:30,740
Give them props.

00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,448
They showed us a lot of good stuff today.

00:32:32,448 --> 00:32:34,430
We saw actual code, as Chuck said.

00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,812
But we need to see that.

00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:36,619
That's a key piece.

00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:38,660
Because think about people who jump into Angular.

00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,120
One of the first things they did-- especially

00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,890
if you came to the Knock Out world.

00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,130
Because at Knock Out you had these observables

00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:43,710
you had to create.

00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,793
And it was kind of a mess.

00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:46,830
You had to dirty up your model to get there.

00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,242
In Angular, it was like, just take my JSON and I'm happy.

00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:49,950
SPEAKER 3: Right.

00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,470
SPEAKER 2: So we need to see what's that next--

00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,610
SPEAKER 3: I don't want to go backwards on that one.

00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,318
SPEAKER 2: Right.

00:32:54,318 --> 00:32:54,354


00:32:54,354 --> 00:32:56,020
SPEAKER 3: I loved the way he clarified,

00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,020
in a way that I've never seen done,

00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,860
all the changes they're doing for data binding and markup.

00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,610
But this is a gaping hole.

00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,880
I know they've got to face it.

00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,120
I know we've got to learn about it.

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,680
But it was missing.

00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,990
I kept waiting for it, and it didn't come.

00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,000
SPEAKER 2: They went 99 yards.

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,280
They've got a yard to go.

00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,710
SPEAKER 3: That's right.

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,220
That's right.

00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:09,928
No touchdown yet.

00:33:09,928 --> 00:33:10,490
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,376


00:33:11,376 --> 00:33:12,500
SPEAKER 1: Forms ain't one.

00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,110
SPEAKER: Not yet.

00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,610
SPEAKER 6: I do have to say, though,

00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,240
that I'm pretty excited to see what they're doing in May 2015

00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,797
when they start moving internal Google Apps over to Angular 2.

00:33:21,797 --> 00:33:22,380
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,754
SPEAKER 6: I mean, at that point,

00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:26,370
what they're saying is that, yeah, it may not

00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,430
be ready for prime time, but it's going to be good enough

00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,835
to build stuff in.

00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:34,380
SPEAKER 1: So I'm going to change topic a little bit,

00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,790
take that liberty.

00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:40,090
So Igor really wants us to focus here not on their team as much,

00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,049
right, but on the community as a whole.

00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:44,590
So I'm actually going to pick another talk from the community

00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,060
that I loved.

00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,980
And it was by Scott Moss.

00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:55,070
And he got up, and he's like, 18 months ago, my life was hard.

00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,490
And then I learned to program, and now, I'm

00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,200
like a senior developer at Udacity.

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,330
And I was like, I suck at life.

00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,960
If he went that far in 18 months,

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,190
we all need to rethink what we're doing.

00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:04,981
SPEAKER: Yeah, wow.

00:34:04,981 --> 00:34:07,140
SPEAKER 1: And then he gave an epic talk--

00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,140
SPEAKER 3: Just amazing.

00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,025
SPEAKER 1: --about, hey, Sasquatch is real.

00:34:10,025 --> 00:34:11,830
And you're like, dude, this is going to be great.

00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,540
SPEAKER 3: So funny, too.

00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,789
SPEAKER 1: And he did awesome.

00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:16,370
And so that was another one I'll never forget.

00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,150
He did awesome.

00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,219
SPEAKER 6: Cool.

00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:23,199
SPEAKER 1: The community really came out swinging here, right?

00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,969
Whether it's the Microsoft team, whether it's

00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:30,888
the Netflix team, whoever it is that's out here swinging,

00:34:30,888 --> 00:34:31,929
they're doing great, man.

00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:34,110
I'm really proud of the community.

00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,580
SPEAKER 6: So we're at 30 minutes.

00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,413
Do you guys want to take a few more minutes?

00:34:37,413 --> 00:34:38,495
Or should we wrap up?

00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:40,851
SPEAKER 4: I need to go practice.

00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:42,600
SPEAKER 2: I've got a talk in a half hour.

00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,266
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:44,770
I say let's wrap it.

00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,401
Make some picks.

00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:46,900
SPEAKER: OK.

00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,560
SPEAKER: Oh, picks?

00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:47,920
Wow.

00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,639
SPEAKER 1: Should we do picks?

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,239
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:49,670
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,139
SPEAKER: Let's pick.

00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,090
SPEAKER: All right.

00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:51,409
SPEAKER: Let's do picks.

00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:52,659
SPEAKER 4: Should we just start over here

00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,300
and end up over there?

00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,620
SPEAKER 6: Yeah, start over on that end.

00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,010
SPEAKER: All right, dude.

00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:55,540
SPEAKER: I've got to think of something.

00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,260
SPEAKER 6: Don't start on this end.

00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,135
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:34:57,135 --> 00:34:57,860
I'll go first.

00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:02,660
I'm going to pick woot.com, because they just sold.

00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,900
They sold me a broken TV.

00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,910
I sent it back.

00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,660
And then they stopped selling them

00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,130
so I couldn't get it again.

00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,480
But then, they sold me now the new 4K version of it.

00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,650
So I actually got a better TV, just because of an internet--

00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,420
anyway, so woot.com.

00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,400
And I'm also going to pick, again, "Ready Player One."

00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,780
I read it again, recently, and my brain

00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,510
exploded thinking about a movie where

00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:29,140
you're on the set of "Family Ties" in like a [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,680
suit.

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,638
It's going to be crazy.

00:35:30,638 --> 00:35:33,020
So anyway, yeah, "Ready Player One."

00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,279
Those are my pics.

00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:35,070
SPEAKER 4: Awesome.

00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:38,450


00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:42,970
So I'm going to pick quadcopters, hint hint.

00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:46,140
If you can rig that deck-- no, I'm just kidding.

00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,955
But yeah, I've been reading a lot of books lately.

00:35:49,955 --> 00:35:51,830
One book that I just read that I really liked

00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,610
was "Dreamers and Deceivers" by Glenn Beck.

00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,770
Just some great stories in there.

00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,927
Just historical stuff.

00:35:58,927 --> 00:36:01,010
Another pick that I have is another book that I've

00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:01,843
been reading lately.

00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:04,097
It's "80/20 Marketing" by Perry Marshall.

00:36:04,097 --> 00:36:06,180
I think I might have picked it on the show before.

00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:12,060
But it's really interesting to see how 80% of your success

00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,190
comes from 20% of your work, and how that applies to programming

00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,120
as well as business.

00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,030
So two books.

00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,720
SPEAKER 3: I know that's true, I just

00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,869
don't know to find that 20%.

00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:25,660
SPEAKER 4: Sometimes, it's hard to measure.

00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,030
And it's like code stuff, right?

00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,110
I mean, some things, it's like, OK, I

00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,490
can see how many users came, because I set an event

00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,150
every time they logged in.

00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,540
And other stuff, it's really hard

00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,830
to figure out, OK, you know, where's the quality code?

00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,020
Which of these things matter?

00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,720
Yeah, and you have to learn how to identify those things

00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,134
and take advantage of them.

00:36:48,134 --> 00:36:48,800
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,200
I've got two picks.

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,550
One is about my kids recently have been involved

00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,970
in theater and drama at school.

00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:57,304
And they've been doing really well in the drama

00:36:57,304 --> 00:36:58,220
departments they have.

00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,844
And what's really struck me is how much

00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:02,144
confidence and how much my kids have grown through this

00:37:02,144 --> 00:37:04,560
and these programs that are always constantly, every year,

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,810
under struggle of financial strain

00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,710
and trying to keep them going and moving.

00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,280
And I just it's one of those things

00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
we all have to pay more attention to is not just

00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,860
fostering coding, but fostering whatever the kids really

00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,810
want to get into moving forward, even if there's not

00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,524
a monetary gain right there.

00:37:19,524 --> 00:37:21,190
It just gives my kids so much confidence

00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,980
to go on to do things with theater.

00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,350
And then more of the technology side, what we live and do,

00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,670
earlier this week, or last weekend, a couple of us

00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,430
got to see Nancy Duarte speak.

00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,787
And it's amazing.

00:37:33,787 --> 00:37:35,370
If you haven't heard her speak before,

00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,660
it was one of the most moving, awesome presentations

00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,180
I have ever seen.

00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,420
Just gave a really effective way to get

00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,050
across how to give presentations, how to,

00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,446
more importantly, affect or influence people.

00:37:47,446 --> 00:37:49,320
SPEAKER 3: And her book is called "Resonate",

00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,230
and I think it's really worth taking a look at that.

00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,390
SPEAKER: Awesome book.

00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,806
SPEAKER 2: And she's got good tips

00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:55,741
for role models for young children, too.

00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:58,000


00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,720
SPEAKER 5: So my choice is-- Aaron mentioned Scott Moss.

00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,400
I actually work with him at Udacity.

00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,710
And I had an opportunity to spend

00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,850
two days prototyping with him last week,

00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,640
and he just killed it.

00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,310
So it was really cool to see somebody

00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:15,450
who, 18 months ago, was just in a hard place,

00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,927
learned how to program, and you can get into the trenches.

00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:19,510
And it just really inspired me to the,

00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:23,520
maybe I'm not asking enough for myself, as a developer.

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,761
Another one is Jeff Goodman.

00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,010
I'm going to be giving a talk with him this afternoon.

00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,885
And I'm not going to give the punchline away,

00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:30,600
but he has literally compelled me

00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,460
to be the best programmer that I can be,

00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,050
because he's completely unqualified.

00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,510
He completely taught himself.

00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,420
And I'm not going to get too much into it.

00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,260
But I love people that are motivated, self-taught,

00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,130
and they are using programming to change their lives.

00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,430
And it makes me realize I can change my life even more,

00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,210
and do better, and effect that change.

00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:51,080
SPEAKER 6: Right, awesome.

00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,660
I'm going to pick, first off, the chocolate

00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,022
malts here at the Little America Hotel.

00:38:56,022 --> 00:38:57,980
Some of the best chocolate malts I've ever had.

00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,910
I tried to limit myself to just one a day,

00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,830
but they are awesome.

00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,410
So if you happen to live here, or if you're ever

00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,245
passing through, and you want a really great chocolate malt,

00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:06,740
this is the place to come.

00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,700
SPEAKER 5: If you happen to live here

00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,574
and he looks at me, you're missing out, dude.

00:39:09,574 --> 00:39:12,230


00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,810
SPEAKER 6: So I want to pick that.

00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,780
And I want to pick, also, "StarCraft II."

00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,370
Because we're having the "StarCraft II" tournament

00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:18,610
tonight.

00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,026
I love "StarCraft II," and I can't

00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:22,900
wait to see two professional "StarCraft" players

00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,830
in the flesh, duking it out after the amateurs have

00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:30,430
their tournament, to watch real, live professional Starcraft

00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:33,450
players, who I love watching, duking it out for all of us

00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,760
to enjoy and watch.

00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,980
So that's my second pick, "StarCraft II."

00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,800
SPEAKER 3: OK.

00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,990
My first pick is a shout out to Funk & Flash,

00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:47,310
a store in Sebastopol, California

00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,650
where I can get my shirts and things like that.

00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,980
So if you're ever wondering-- a lot of people ask me,

00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,146
where do you get that stuff?

00:39:52,146 --> 00:39:55,550
And that's one of the places, Funk & Flash.

00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:00,990
My technical shout out is that their-- OK, so Angular 2.0

00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,440
is alpha now.

00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,740
They're going to wise up and try it out, and see how it really

00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,760
plays.

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,722
And by May, or somewhere around there,

00:40:09,722 --> 00:40:11,680
they expect to be able to come back and tell us

00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,260
how it's really going.

00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,970
And there will be some conferences that are available.

00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,617
Joe, you're running one.

00:40:17,617 --> 00:40:18,450
Tell him what it is.

00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,366
SPEAKER: Tell me more.

00:40:19,366 --> 00:40:22,000


00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,830
SPEAKER 6: There we go.

00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,070
It's called ng-vegas.

00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,930
It's May 7th and 8th.

00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:29,650
It's actually not in the heart of Vegas.

00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,770
It's up in Henderson, just above-- up in the hills on lake

00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:36,080
Las Vegas, which is where Celine Dion has her house.

00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,630
So there's like one side of the lake

00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,870
is all these crazy huge houses.

00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,810
The other side is these awesome resort spas.

00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:43,780
So I'm really excited about the venue,

00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,420
because it's a fun venue-- pools,

00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,550
and a beach, and paddle boards, and stuff like that.

00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:53,559
And what I really like about it is we

00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:55,100
can actually, in the call for papers,

00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,040
have people submitting Angular 2 topics.

00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,630
Which is something we couldn't do for ng-conf, right?

00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,171
The Angular team got to come and talk

00:41:01,171 --> 00:41:03,894
about Angular 2.0, but everybody that submitted a talk, if they

00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,310
maybe got to incorporate some Angular 2.0 into their talk,

00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,380
but their talk couldn't be about Angular 2,

00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,940
because there really wasn't anything

00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,830
in November about Angular 2, and now there is.

00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,340
So I'm really excited for that.

00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,200
And I hope that we see a vast majority

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,120
of our talks about Angular 2 in some capacity or another.

00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,655
SPEAKER 3: And so the second conference

00:41:22,655 --> 00:41:26,290
is Angular U. It'll be in San Francisco.

00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:29,990
The Angular team will be there talking about their findings,

00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,820
and we'll also have more people talking

00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:35,300
about what they've learned working their way

00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,120
through the evolution of it.

00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,710
And I know I will be there.

00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,700
SPEAKER 6: When's that?

00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,580
SPEAKER 3: That's in June, isn't it?

00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,070
SPEAKER: Late June.

00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:43,945
SPEAKER 3: Late June.

00:41:43,945 --> 00:41:46,700
So tickets are available for both of these conferences.

00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,705
And if you are looking to get hip with what's going on,

00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:52,330
you've got to sign up for some tickets.

00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,370
SPEAKER 6: And I want to let you know

00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,707
that I will be there speaking.

00:41:54,707 --> 00:41:55,540
SPEAKER 3: Fabulous!

00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,581
That's going to be great.

00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,140
It'll be good to see you there.

00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,750
SPEAKER: Well, now I have to come.

00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,500
SPEAKER 6: You do.

00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,560
Please come.

00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,930
That one is going to be awesome.

00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,540
In the mecca of our industry.

00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,410
SPEAKER: Right.

00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,120
SPEAKER 3: So folks, go out there and get some tickets.

00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,480
Planning a pilgrimage?

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,396
SPEAKER: Yes, I am going to take a pilgrimage.

00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,069


00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:14,860
SPEAKER 6: Awesome.

00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:18,070
Well, I don't think we have any announcements or anything.

00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:22,010
So thanks to our live studio audience, and--

00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:25,293
[CHEERING]

00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,640


00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,500
SPEAKER 6: --we'll talk to you all next week!

00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,050
SPEAKER: And cut.
