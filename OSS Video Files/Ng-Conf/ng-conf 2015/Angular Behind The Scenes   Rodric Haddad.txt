00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:02,820
All right.

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,530
So, hey there, everyone.

00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,690
It's so exciting to be here, seeing us

00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,209
all united to talk about Angular in these two days.

00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:11,750
It's pretty special for our speakers.

00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,166
I mean, we have amazing organizers

00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:15,270
that decided to organize the conference.

00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,800
And then we get contacted, and the next thing you know,

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,140
we're smiling in front of 700 people.

00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,700
I find that pretty cool.

00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,200
So my name is Rodric, and I'm a developer on the Core team.

00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,150
And I'm here to talk to you about Angular

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,900
behind the scenes.

00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,020
So more specifically, what I want to talk about

00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,660
is what I believe makes Angular special.

00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,090
So this isn't a technical talk.

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,798
So you can put your notepads to the side.

00:00:37,798 --> 00:00:40,450
And just listen to me try to entertain you.

00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,106
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:42,106 --> 00:00:44,786
So I got involved in Angular about two years ago.

00:00:44,786 --> 00:00:46,160
And if you asked me why I thought

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,440
it was special back then, I'd probably

00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,600
say something related to directives, bindings,

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,312
or dependency injections.

00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:54,770
And while those concepts are great,

00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,940
and they do make the framework special,

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,220
my answer to that question has changed over the course

00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,210
of the last year.

00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,380
Now, it has to do more with the people behind the project,

00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,660
as well as how they use the Google infrastructure

00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,590
to benefit everyone.

00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,400
So I currently work for the team remotely from Montreal, Canada.

00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,650
But during the last summer, I got recruited as an intern

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,640
and spent four months working with the team

00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,145
in Mountain View, California.

00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:24,520
And with that experience, I often

00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,590
get asked, what are the kind of stuff you only find out

00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,730
once you join the team?

00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:32,390
Or how did you get your internship in the first place?

00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,110
And those are fun questions to answer.

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,640
And I want to try to do so with some personal stories

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,820
and observations.

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,490
The one to start with naturally is

00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,700
how I got my internship, which actually happened last year

00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,320
in that corner of the room.

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,260
Vojta was standing there enjoying

00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,810
his first day of ng-conf 2014, and I wanted to talk to him.

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,250
I had some stuff I wanted to show him.

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,540
But I wasn't sure, how do you approach

00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,770
someone whose full time job is to build a superhero?

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,000
So I'm usually a pretty self resourceful guy,

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,110
and I had these free drinks coupons.

00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,760
And I'm under 21, and you can't drink in the US

00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,860
if you're under 21.

00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,740
So I came up to Vojta and offered him my drinks.

00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,070
And he jokingly replied asking me if he should go to the bar,

00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,790
get the drinks, and come back to give it to me.

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,740
I declined.

00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,060
I mean, I won't break the law.

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,581
I'm Canadian, after all.

00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:23,545
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:24,530


00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,752
So from there, we started talking.

00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:29,460
I showed him some stuff I was working on.

00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,152
He liked it.

00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:31,360
We were talking passionately.

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,580
And then Misko joined us.

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,340
And he asked me, hey, would you like to join the Angular

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,350
team as an intern?

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,460
And my initial response about was yes,

00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,350
but I need to ask my parents first.

00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,170
But it was actually the good response, because a week later,

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,030
I got contacted by Google HR.

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,300
I did my interviews and then flew to California

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,310
to become a Google intern on the Angular team.

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,102
It was a new experience for me, and I got to learn about.

00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:58,810
And I didn't spend my days making coffee.

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,480
I actually worked on some cool projects.

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,990
The proof of that is this is on my first week.

00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,383
I broke the build.

00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:07,355
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,330


00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,880
I had Igor as my supervisor, and I

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,740
got to work on stuff like speeding up Angular, improving

00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,850
our Travis build, or helping out with the Traceur compiler.

00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,150
And I got to interact with many members of the team,

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,900
and I realized how much their work affects

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,002
people around the globe, but they're still humble about it.

00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:29,460
I mean, this project is pretty big.

00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,320
We have almost 1,200 contributors on GitHub,

00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,640
which is an obviously small set of people

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,510
who work full or part-time on the project.

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,360
And I tried to make a list of them.

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,960
And when I look at this list, there's

00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,390
something special that pops in my mind.

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,040
So in the last two years that I've

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,170
been involved in this project, I've

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,990
witnessed the first contributions

00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,910
of many of these people.

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,960
I realize that many of them joined the team by their help

00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,230
and contribution on GitHub, not by some Googling hire process.

00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,700
They got noticed by their Hub, not by their resume.

00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,830
Now, it's my story, too.

00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,400
Before becoming an intern, I was a regular normal contributor

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,200
on GitHub.

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,320
I would help with issues and support requests.

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,040
And I feel that that strongly makes

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,070
us a part of the community.

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,399
You know, as opposed to "apart" from the community.

00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,440
There's an obvious vocabulary error here.

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,680
There's a missing white space.

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,660
Yeah, that's better.

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,460
Yeah.

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,670
All our work happens on GitHub, public for anyone

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,370
to see, not on some Google internal tool.

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,390
And even our meeting notes and our design docs,

00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,084
they're all on Google Docs for anyone to see.

00:04:38,084 --> 00:04:39,375
We even tweet about this stuff.

00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,470
So you can come, read them, comment on them,

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,140
and join the conversation.

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,220
I've been in many critical discussions

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,540
inside my internship that started

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,660
in person for convenience, but quickly moved to GitHub

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,430
for further community feedback.

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,170
Or also, we'd take notes and put them on Google Docs for anyone

00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,520
to comment on.

00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,550
And we really like that about our team.

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,060
Most of us come directly from the community.

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,030
It's one of the reasons why I believe Angular is special.

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,790
So if you see us walking by, if you have something to tell us,

00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,470
don't hesitate to do so.

00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,230
I mean, that's how I got my internship.

00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,730
And also, it's a great way to create

00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,480
collaboration between people and organizations.

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,430
And this doesn't just apply in person.

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,260
If you have something to tell us, you can reach to us online.

00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,100
And if there's space for collaboration,

00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,210
we'd be happy to chip in.

00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,279
Oh, and by the way, I'm still under 21.

00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,070
And I still have these free drinks coupons.

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,340
So if you want them, you now have a reason to come up to me

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:31,970
and talk.

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,090


00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,590
All right.

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,690
So, so far, my presentation was filled with emotions

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,150
and personal opinions.

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,940
But this is a technology conference,

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,557
so I'll try to be more technical for the next story.

00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:46,890
So we're still talking about what makes Angular special.

00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,870
And I want to go over our release process,

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,460
because I believe it's very telling.

00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,260
So we pop up a new Angular version every single week,

00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,090
and it's a great way to get quick community feedback.

00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,860
And also, if you send a support request,

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,720
you'll be able to benefit from your change much quicker

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,900
than if we release at a slower rate.

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,600
So on the fifth week of my internship,

00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,540
I got asked to be the release master.

00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,790
Well, it wasn't as much ask as much it was,

00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,620
Rody, you're doing the release.

00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,226
But I still hopped on the opportunity to do it.

00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:19,850
We have a specific set of tasks that we

00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,760
need to do to get out a new version,

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,657
so wasn't all that complicated.

00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:25,740
The first thing you have to do as a release master

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,460
is to make sure that our stable branch is as up to date

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,000
as can be, without including any breaking changes.

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,530
So we ask our contributors to send their per request

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,530
to our master branch, which is where

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,157
we're developing 1.4 right now.

00:06:38,157 --> 00:06:39,740
But every time we merge something new,

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,406
if it doesn't have any breaking changes,

00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:45,520
we'll cherry pick it to 1.3, which is our stable branch.

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,170
So if your app depends on the stable branch,

00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,670
you'll always get the best Angular

00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,590
we can give you without including any breaking changes.

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,730
And if it depends on the latest branch,

00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,460
you'll always get the new goodies fast.

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,480
But I suggest you continue reading our change

00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,240
log every once in awhile, just in case

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,150
we introduce the feature with a breaking change,

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,390
just to avoid undesired surprises.

00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,140
So as a release master, I had to make sure

00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,080
that this process had been done correctly.

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,830
Because there's a lot of activity

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,920
that happens on the Angular [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,110
There's an average of 30 to 40 commits

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,660
that get reviewed and merge every single week,

00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,599
and we don't want our stable branch to miss out on any.

00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:24,890
So if there's a commit that's in the latest branch that

00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,600
isn't in the stable branch, there

00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,700
needs to be a reason for it.

00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,320
All right.

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,260
So latest versus stable branch, that has been taken care of.

00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,660
Next here is testing.

00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,440
And I've got to say, in Angular, we're pretty wild on testing.

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,990
We have the thing where we have almost 4,000 unit

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,352
tests that run every time we hit Save on a new file.

00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:46,060
And you might think that's enough, right?

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,720
But actually, our full test feed has a lot more.

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,100
Now, you see the tests that sometimes show up

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,060
in our documentation that go with some examples.

00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,760
You might think that those are just for readers to check out,

00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,968
get familiar with how tests are written in an Angular

00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:01,220
application.

00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,580
But actually, we take those examples with their tests

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,110
and run them to make sure that they're working correctly.

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,610
So not only do we run our unit tests

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,930
to make sure that things works as we expect them,

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,100
but we also run our documentation tests

00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,390
to make sure that what you're reading is valid.

00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,870
And also, you know the whole thing

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,910
with jQLite versus jQuery?

00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,550
jQLite is the lightweight version of jQuery

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,300
that ships with Angular and only contains the stuff we need.

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,510
And you probably know that when jQuery

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,300
is available on the page, Angular

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,950
will use it instead of jQLite.

00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,460
Well, we run our tests in both scenarios,

00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,110
with and without jQuery.

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,890
Also, when we push to GitHub, Travis picks it up.

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,890
And it runs our tests in all major browsers.

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,220
That's Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE 9, 10, and 11.

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,260
I did the calculation.

00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,430
That's almost 50,000 tests running

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,750
each in a different scenario or environment.

00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,160
And you'll probably think that's enough, right?

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,210
But actually, there is more.

00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,210
So you know I said all our work happens on GitHub,

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,220
but we have almost 2000 Google Apps that use Angular.

00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,710
So what we do is we sink our GitHub commits

00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,450
into Google's internal code base.

00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,140
And you can see the status of that on our dashboard.

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,320
And once we do that update, we trigger

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,910
the tests of all the Angular apps inside Google

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,280
to make sure that we didn't break anything for them.

00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,740
So, for example, there's the Google Cloud Platform,

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,970
which is written in Angular.

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,930
Whenever we update Angular, we run their tests.

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,910
And it's a great way to make sure that the use

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,210
cases that 100 other developers thought of,

00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,400
that they're still valid without ever needing to consult us.

00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,300
So that means that we have our unit tests,

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,890
and end to end tests, and Docs tests

00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,860
that we run in all major browsers

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,130
with and without jQuery.

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,410
And we also have the Angular apps inside Google

00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,350
that we run their tests before doing every release.

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,990
So the first time I found out about this,

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,660
I was pretty mind-blown, like whew!

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,390
I mean, so much tests, so much CPU power.

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,560
But at least Google leans on renewable energy.

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,796
So that's good.

00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:16,040
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,540


00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,710
So tests.

00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,380
That was fun to talk about.

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,170
Another thing that's fun to talk about is release names.

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,370
So whenever we do a new Angular version,

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,050
we give it a code name.

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,940
Which, because Angular is a superhero,

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,700
it needs to be a superpower.

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,240
And we started out great, with code names

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,690
like Dragon-Breath, Cold-Resistance,

00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,410
or Repulsion-Field.

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,030
But then, I'm not sure what happened.

00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,070
We ended up with names like Eggplant-Teleportation,

00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,950
Prime-Factorization-- a pretty good superpower--

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:59,410
Barehand-Atomsplitting, and Beer-Underestimating.

00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,220
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,885
Great superpowers, I know.

00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:04,630
There's probably a story behind each one.

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,470
So, so far, we have 132 versions, so 132 superpowers.

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,720
And you can actually come and submit your own on this URL.

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,400
It's actually a Google Moderator,

00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,760
so it's fairly easy to use.

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,510
Just come suggest your release name.

00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,520
Vote on the stuff you like, and maybe you'll

00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,315
end up naming the rest of these.

00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,600
I see some people taking pictures.

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,420
So when I was doing the release, I

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,030
had to get out the latest on a stable version.

00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,540
I made my latest version ephemeral-acceleration,

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,180
because it had a lot of performance boost,

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,410
and my stable one ear-extendability,

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,780
because it had a lot of documentation changes.

00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,430
When I did the task, I published on NPM, Bower, and our CDM.

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,460
And it was on a Friday night, the best time to do a release.

00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,920
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,420


00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,300
Nothing could go wrong, right?

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,594
We've changed since then.

00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,760
So when I was doing the release, actually, something

00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,550
did go wrong.

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,440
So I hadn't verified if the tests inside Google were

00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,685
passing, and they actually weren't.

00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,310
But I'm actually kind of proud of that.

00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,850
I mean, on my first week, I broke Angular.

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,740
On my fifth week, I broke Google.

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,650
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,150


00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,596
[CLAPPING]

00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:19,720


00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,830
Probably next step for me is breaking the internet.

00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,520
If you have any tips on how to do that, let me know.

00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,380
So from there, I couldn't just leave the office

00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,320
and keep Google broken.

00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,100
So I did what anybody in my position would have done.

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,300
So I took out my Angular cape from my back pocket.

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,690
It was upside down.

00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,510
I put it on.

00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:49,290


00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,015
And then I turned back to my laptop to debug.

00:12:53,015 --> 00:12:54,500
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,480


00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,955
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:01,301


00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:03,050
And well, I found out that it was actually

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,620
a pretty simple issue.

00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,420
So with one of the performance commits,

00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,680
we had shortened-- my mic's still good.

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,850


00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,070
So with one of the performance commits,

00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,450
we had shortened one of our internal properties,

00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,690
and that was causing a naming collision with a library

00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,737
inside of Google.

00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:27,320
It was actually the expander property,

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,470
which is a property jQuery and jQLite

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,020
uses to put on HTML elements.

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,890
And that's for tracking data across an application.

00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,170
So to fix it, all I did was append my favorite number

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,660
to it, which is 339.

00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,864
And voila, I'd fixed the issue.

00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:46,780
And from there, I had to do the release again.

00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,904
This time, I named it idiosyncratic-numerification.

00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:51,460


00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,290
And it has just one fix in it.

00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,670
So yeah, that's why you'll find it in the change log.

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,850
So if I have some advice I could give you,

00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,240
that if you're still on Angular 1.2,

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,470
you should try to upgrade to 1.3.

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,010
Because you'll get performance boost right out of the box.

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,014
And also, my favorite number will

00:14:12,014 --> 00:14:13,180
be on all our HTML elements.

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,800


00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,905
Same thing with 1.4 just around the corner.

00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:21,280
When it's gets stable enough, you

00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,940
should also consider upgrading.

00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,290
Because you also get performance boosts there.

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,460
And also, my favorite number is still in it.

00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,130
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,110


00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,730
All right, to recap more on why Angular is special,

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,000
so even though our organization contains

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,870
a lot of people that work for Google, most of us

00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,480
come directly from the community.

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,700
And I'm a good example of that.

00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,060
And also, we try to keep everything public so anybody

00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,520
could contribute easily.

00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,260
We're an open source project, after all,

00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,850
and the barrier for contribution should-- and in my opinion,

00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,516
is-- minimal.

00:14:57,516 --> 00:14:59,640
And we also try to give you the best Angular we can

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,850
by maintaining latest and stable versions,

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,470
and also by having an amazing testing infrastructure,

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,760
taking advantage of our position in Google.

00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,740
These are the kind of stuff you don't find out

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,420
on a project's homepage, but they still, in my opinion,

00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,150
make Angular a one of a kind project.

00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,100
So thank you for listening, and thank you for your support.

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,000
And if you have any questions about my internship experience

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,120
or our release process, don't hesitate

00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,910
to do so after the conference, after my talk, or on Reddit.

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,620
So thank you.

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,970
[APPLAUSE]
