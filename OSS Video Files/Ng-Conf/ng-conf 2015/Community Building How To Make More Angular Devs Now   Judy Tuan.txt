00:00:01,284 --> 00:00:02,140
JUDY: Woo-hoo.

00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,828
How's everyone doing?

00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:04,328
Still awake?

00:00:04,328 --> 00:00:07,250


00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:07,780
OK.

00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,890
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,110
I'm Judy.

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,630
And I'm here to show you how to make more Angular

00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,190
developers now by fostering an inclusive, diverse community.

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:24,240


00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,820
Hello?

00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,590
There we go.

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,650
So, preliminary slide.

00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,850
Let's lead the charge.

00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,440
This is a call to action.

00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,474
I believe the Angular has a great opportunity right now.

00:00:33,474 --> 00:00:35,390
Across the country, there's a movement pushing

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,530
for code literacy in everyone.

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,800
Did you guys see the picture of the President learning

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,980
JavaScript?

00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,310
Code.org.

00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,040
In our industry, there's a rising tide

00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,570
of visibility of the ways in which lack of diversity

00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,540
hurts us.

00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,900
And I'd like to add to what Brad said this morning

00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,770
about fostering cooperation to make

00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,980
the dream of open source come alive.

00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,520
I want to add to that and say, I'd

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,030
like to call upon each of us to make Angular

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,459
a friendly, inclusive community so

00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,020
that we can give people what they

00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,560
need to build awesome stuff.

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,630
So that's why I'm here.

00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,880
So-- oops.

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,170
Also, maybe my slides will load.

00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:23,350
While they load, I'll give you a little outline of my talk.

00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,810
So I'm going to tell you my story.

00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,990
I'm going to give you a case study of RailsBridge,

00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,740
which I'll tell you about in a little bit.

00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:37,420
And I'll end with a call to action

00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,710
to make ng-bridge happen.

00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,910
OK.

00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,360
I guess I'll keep hitting Reload.

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
I can just talk at you.

00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,251
It's story time.

00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:51,750
OK.

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,210
So I'd like to tell you a little bit about how

00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,450
I got to where I am.

00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,350


00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,030
I think that it's really important to share your story.

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,330
So please come up to me afterwards and tell me

00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,460
how you got here, also.

00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,075
I think we can't forget that we're all humans.

00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:15,386


00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,010
We're doing all of this for each other.

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,121
Oh!

00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:18,620
OK.

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,970
And we'll turn off our Wi-Fi.

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:20,470
OK.

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,150
So a little bit about me.

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,980
I've been a video gamer for a long time.

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,180
I worked at a video game store, a LAN cafe in Berkeley

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,489
called Eudemonia, and hosted lots of events.

00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:32,030
We would watch StarCraft tournaments.

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,920
So many nerds would pack in.

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,730
And we'd tune in to watch live streamed tournaments from Korea

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,750
at 1:00 AM our time.

00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,240
It was great.

00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:47,120
And this was how I got a bunch of knowledge,

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,095
a bunch of experience, in building communities.

00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:51,720
I found that a lot of times if I wanted

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,580
to play a game, like the World of Warcraft Minis game--

00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,290
if you didn't know, there was a World of Warcraft collectible

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,850
miniatures game-- I needed to find people to play with.

00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,990
And so the way to do that was to host events for it.

00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,110
And just keep hosting them until people came.

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,278
So don't give up.

00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:11,680
TECHNICIAN: Is that it?

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,050
JUDY: Yeah.

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,340
Cool.

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:21,918
And then I think we can just-- if we go here,

00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:23,340
is it in full screen?

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,215
TECHNICIAN: How many engineers does it take--

00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:27,260
JUDY: How many engineers does it take to do this?

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,550
Oh, this is good enough.

00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,799
You can just see all my notes.

00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:30,790
It's OK.

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,160
Woo-hoo.

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,680
All right.

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,330


00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:36,830
OK.

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,740
So I found my way into professional coding by way

00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,620
of a constructed language called Na'vi, which was the language

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,894
spoken by the blue aliens in "Avatar."

00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:47,310
So I got really involved in Na'vi.

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,890
There's a passionate community at learnnavi.org,

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,945
mostly by translating songs into Na'vi.

00:03:52,945 --> 00:03:54,010
It was pretty ridiculous.

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,400
And a language startup in the area

00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,320
called Mightyverse reached out to us and said,

00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,700
you guys are strange, but passionate.

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,140
Will you record phrases for our language startup?

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,950
And so I acted as the community liaison.

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,320
And that's how I met their CTO, Sarah Allen,

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,830
who told me about this organization called

00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,750
RailsBridge.

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,525
And I had taken AP CS in high school.

00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,295
And had done programming.

00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,920
But I had taken a little break from it.

00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,360
And I was ready to come back.

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,609
So right when I was ready to come back, and right when

00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:28,500
I was doing tutorials on my own, I

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,890
met this woman who became my mentor.

00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,875
And so I think a lot of life is like that.

00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,000
You're ready for something.

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,710
And then something comes along, and you take the opportunity.

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,920
So this is how I found out about RailsBridge.

00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,590
I started going to hackathons and stuff,

00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,714
and won my first hackathon.

00:04:46,714 --> 00:04:50,370
And then I ended up getting to work for Sarah as a software

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:50,870
developer.

00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,590
She's the one who gave me my first job as a software

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,350
developer.

00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,247
And so I got really involved in the community.

00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:58,580
We did a lot of community stuff.

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,500
So more on that when I tell you about RailsBridge.

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,180
So now I work at Indiegogo, a crowdfunding platform.

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,420
Our first Angular app was a rewrite of our campaign editor.

00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,320
We went from a complicated sprawling process

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,300
over four Rails pages with noodly JavaScript

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,820
all over the place-- it didn't make any sense-- to a much more

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,930
intuitive single-page app, greatly

00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,950
increasing the ease of launching and editing campaigns.

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,900
And so these were some of the first Angular

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,030
users at our company.

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,330


00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,500
We've since expanded the Angularization of the world

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,060
by proselytizing it to other engineering, other scrum teams

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,430
that we have.

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,610
And one of the best examples of how you use Angular

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,060
is our new Life platform, which is an even easier

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,190
to use fundraiser platform for individuals.

00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:00,640
So this brought me to events.

00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,480
Indiegogo hosted a girl geek dinner in San Francisco.

00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,480
And seven of us did lightning talks.

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,920
And instead of a lightning talk, I sang mine.

00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,040
So and then I got to take it international.

00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,640
So I got to go to ng-europe and sing my song,

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,780
and share it with the Angular community at large.

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,280
Thanks.

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,820


00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,700
And while I was at ng-europe-- and so

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,660
this is me getting to the point.

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,520
While I was at ng-europe, I looked around,

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,670
and there were almost more women onstage

00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,480
than there were in the audience.

00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,050
And you don't notice that at first.

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,130
Then you go on.

00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,110
And it reminded me a lot of RailsBridge's origin story.

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,850
So I see parallels between new technologies

00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,110
and what's happened.

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,140
So this brings me to what is RailsBridge?

00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll tell you a story about RailsBridge, and why I think

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,570
it matters for Angular developers to hear this story.

00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,500


00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:13,010
So to take it to a different framework

00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,610
in a different language, in 2009,

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,110
two people named Sarah were at GoGaRuCo, which is the San

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,620
Francisco Ruby conference.

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,480
And there's a statistic floating around

00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,962
that 20% of people who are working

00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:27,170
as professional software developers in Silicon Valley

00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,520
are women.

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,160
But when they were at this conference in 2009,

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,700
for what, at the time, was like the new hotness,

00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,760
it was catching on, they saw six women

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,190
among 300 men, which was 2%.

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,140
And so they wondered why this happens.

00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,220
Why, even among women developers,

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,200
women seem to embrace the newest technologies

00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,800
at smaller percentages than men, even

00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,660
correcting for the difference in the industry at large.

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,510
And this could be a totally separate research topic.

00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,010
But what's important here is that they did more than wonder.

00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,760
They decided to make more Rails developers

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,450
by teaching Rails to a bunch of women,

00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,520
which sounds really simple.

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:19,420
And I just wanted to show you so-- this is what a RailsBridge

00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,620
event looks like.

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,480


00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,090
OK.

00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,210
I'll-- maybe if I do that?

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:30,940
OK.

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,380
It's stuck on small screen.

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,039
It's OK.

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,710
So they started hosting an event called RailsBridge,

00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,919
which was a free Rails workshop for women and their friends.

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,679
They did everything open and copyable

00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,450
from the start on purpose, because they

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,330
hoped that other people would take

00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,670
the framework of what they worked on, and replicate it

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,602
in other languages.

00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:53,310
They looked around at other organizations

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,070
that they admired, and adopted their successful tactics

00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,670
for fostering diversity, especially gender diversity.

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,380
I know there's other kinds of diversity,

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,600
but we focused on gender for these events.

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,050
So Women 2.0 is a community organization

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,870
that hosts lots of conferences and stuff in San Francisco.

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,670
And they came up with a tagline--

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,520
"Let men be the plus ones for a change."

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,480
So we accept students who are women,

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,080
and students who are men as long that

00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,360
come as a plus one of a woman.

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,026
So if there was a man who wanted to attend this free programming

00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:31,330
workshop, we asked them, bring your friend, coworker,

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,599
fellow student, sister, niece, aunt, grandmother.

00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:37,640
And that way we would at least have gender parity

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,180
among the students.

00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,945
And then all the volunteers and organizers were any gender.

00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:44,820
So they asked all their friends and coworkers

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,980
to help teach and watch their kids-- childcare is important--

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,067
and get the word out.

00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,400
And it was originally designed for professional software

00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,740
developers, like those other 20% hanging out,

00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,584
doing Java and PHP.

00:09:57,584 --> 00:09:59,500
It was like, hey, come check out what we think

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,910
is the new hotness.

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,250
It's fun to learn something new.

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,380
Let's lower the barriers of entry.

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,700
We'll just show you in a one-day workshop.

00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,540
So that was one of the original visions.

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,310
RailsBridge has since grown to accommodate people

00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,520
who are totally new to programming,

00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,870
such as, for example, adults contemplating a career switch.

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,020
So at any given RailsBridge, we've

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,400
taught people who are like 20-year industry veterans,

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,480
as well as people who've never installed an app on their Mac

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,510
before, because IT always did it for them.

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:40,700
So we've been able to help a wide variety of people.

00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,260
So all this was to serve the goal

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,940
of exposing more people, especially women, to Rails.

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,480


00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,530
And it worked.

00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,520
This is a slide from a talk that Sarah Mei

00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,560
gave-- one of the Sarahs that founded RailsBridge--

00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,440
in 2010, titled "Moving the Needle-- How SF Ruby Got

00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,580
to 18%."

00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,390
And her talk, which I linked to in the notes,

00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,690
is the story of how they increased the participation

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,430
of women in the general San Francisco Ruby meetups

00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,280
from 2% to 18% in just a year.

00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,310
So this is important.

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:20,210
They hosted the RailsBridges not as siloed, ghetto, like oh hey,

00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,070
the women are going to be over here.

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,135
They made sure to bring them back into the general Ruby hack

00:11:26,135 --> 00:11:28,430
nights that people hosted, got people

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,300
to talk at lightning talks.

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,200
And then, over time, they were able to actually move

00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,690
the needle in a pretty significant way in just one

00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,940
year.

00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,610
So having known this story, I looked around at ng-europe,

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,147
and I thought, we can do this.

00:11:46,147 --> 00:11:46,980
We can do this, too.

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,880
In fact, we must do this now, because Angular

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,980
isn't just the new hotness.

00:11:52,980 --> 00:12:00,750
It's still hotness, but we're like, it's up to us

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,350
to get the tool out to reach more people,

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,440
so that more people can build awesome stuff.

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,000
So anyway, this idea of free workshops

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,290
for women and their friends spread to other cities

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,950
and languages and frameworks.

00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,760
And I'll make another little aside

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,630
to talk about a different programming community, again.

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,970
One of the most visible successes of this idea

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,125
spreading is Python.

00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:29,000


00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,500
Oh yeah.

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,410
And I have this quote that I like

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,910
from an article called "A Toast Story"

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,250
that got picked up by NPR.

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,040
It's a story about-- or got picked up by "This American

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,840
Life," actually.

00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,240
And it's the story about Trouble Coffee in San Francisco,

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,720
and how one woman relies on a support network of weak ties.

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,530
And I just want to say this, because I

00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,882
think learning from other programming communities

00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:55,590
is important, because we have to remember

00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:00,360
that we're here as part of like a larger technical community.

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,100
And we don't have to keep reinventing the wheel.

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,190
And so we keep spreading ideas.

00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,610
So here's an example of their success.

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,070
The Python community also started running workshops.

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,570
Most notably, the Boston Python Workshop, which was directly

00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,770
inspired by RailsBridge.

00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,840
They took the format and were like, woop.

00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,719
So one metric that the Python community has really

00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:28,260
moved the needle on is the percentage

00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,990
of talks at Python with a woman speaking.

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,890
In three years, they changed this percentage from 1% in 2011

00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,290
to 33% in 2014.

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,440
And this wasn't through any kind of diversity quota or anything.

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,230
Instead, it was getting more proposals into the pipeline

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,590
to begin with.

00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,820
So a woman named Jessica McKellar writes emails

00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,980
to all the programmers she knows who are women who she thinks

00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,520
would give great talks at Python.

00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,440
And now, since she's done it, sends many dozens and even

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,940
hundreds of these emails, they start getting

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,940
more and more proposals.

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:09,020


00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,640
Let's take it like back home to Angular.

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,790
So this is my proposal, and my big ask of all of you.

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,630
RailsBridge has recognized that this

00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,120
is a useful set of information.

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,640
And so we created an umbrella organization

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
called Bridge Foundry.

00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,299
So we want to make a whole bunch of bridges

00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,590
so that we can teach all the technologies to everybody.

00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,645
So let's make ng-bridge happen.

00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:38,210


00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:42,690
So I'll tell you a little bit about what makes up a workshop.

00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,660
So here are the ingredients to go home to whatever city

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,305
you're from and pop up an ng-bridge in your Angular user

00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:52,140
group.

00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,070
So you need to get some sponsors, like a space.

00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,090
And a space that works for these kinds of workshops

00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,960
is a main area where you'll have lunch,

00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,310
with breakout rooms where you can have classes.

00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:10,280
And the classes are like six people, separated by ability.

00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,220


00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,460
You need a sponsor for food.

00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,660
And don't forget vegetarian, et cetera, options.

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,060
You need some volunteers for childcare.

00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,140
In San Francisco, RailsBridge has

00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,630
been experimenting with hiring childcare

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,630
from different services.

00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,150
So that's also something that works.

00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,570
But these are important.

00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,910
These are the basics of what you need.

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,840
Childcare helps reduce the barrier of entry

00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:45,380
to working parents.

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,230
So then, in terms of people, of course, you need volunteers.

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,050
And you need three kinds of volunteers-- facilitators,

00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:56,710
people who run the workshop, make sure the food is arriving,

00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,120
send out the questionnaire to ask people

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,340
how it went at the end, people to promote the event.

00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,610
And you also need teachers and TAs.

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:15,180
We've found that it helps to set up a meeting for the teachers

00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,040
and TAs like the Wednesday beforehand.

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,944
So we usually have these on a Saturday,

00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,402
and then we'll do a teacher meeting on Wednesday beforehand

00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:23,690
to get everything working.

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,390
You need a curriculum, which usually

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,460
takes the form of a working app that a student

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,914
can bang through in a day, and then have something to show.

00:16:32,914 --> 00:16:34,830
Hey, I learned to make this Angular app today.

00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,570
And they can show their friends.

00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,110
And that also helps spread the word.

00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:44,060
Like, you, too, can go learn this much Angular in a day.

00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,120
And, of course, students.

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,510
It always helps to have an after party.

00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,120
We like to thank our volunteers by giving all of the volunteers

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,130
a free drink ticket.

00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,930
And one interesting thing that happens with this model

00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,380
is that people will come in as students,

00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,950
and then they might come as a student

00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,075
a couple of times in a row.

00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:05,609
We try to have these every month.

00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,730
And then they'll start coming back as a TA

00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,804
or as an organizer.

00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:10,720
And then after that, after a couple of months,

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,040
they'll start coming back as a teacher.

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,210
And then after that, they've gotten exposure

00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:21,260
to all these sponsoring companies, and they get hired.

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,960
So this is proven to work.

00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,920
I've seen it happen in front of my eyes over and over again.

00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:33,920
This is one way of many that we can make more Angular

00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,380
developers out of people in our community

00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,560
who are already interested.

00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:44,180
So why your company should host an ng-bridge.

00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,280
You'll have visibility to new Angular developers,

00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,450
of course, like the students, which is obvious, right?

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:55,470
And the second one is also, in hindsight, really obvious.

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:01,050
What happened was that we saw that companies that

00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:06,130
were hosting these events, they had a very high recruiting

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,930
value for these events for more senior developers

00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,150
as well, because these were the teachers, the liaisons,

00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,650
the volunteers, the ones who were spending a lot of time.

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,850
And so this is one really good way

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,580
to get the word out to the most engaged and active members

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,290
of the community.

00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:25,760
So running intro workshops for Angular

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,850
and getting a robust community of volunteers

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:32,750
is actually a great way to attract senior devs

00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,030
to your community.

00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,490
And I have 19 seconds left.

00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,660


00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,700
Yeah.

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,130
There's a quote that Sarah Allen likes to say,

00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,710
which is "To boil the ocean, turn every 10th molecule

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,630
into a heater."

00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,770
So come talk to me.

00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,400
I hope that if you feel inspired,

00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,900
you go home and run events like this.

00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,650
Mentors matter.

00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,060
We can make more ng-fixits happen.

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,460
With a lot of help Igor, or we ran an ng-fixit number 1

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,590
to work on the Angular core itself.

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,485
We'll make ng hack nights, and if you have ideas-- woo-hoo,

00:19:10,485 --> 00:19:11,270
yeah.

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,180
If you have more ideas for events,

00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,890
go forth and make them happen.

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,900
I will help you.

00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,400
Yeah.

00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,010
Talk to me.

00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:20,707
Anyway.

00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:21,540
Thank you very much.

00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,740
That's all I've got.

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,490
