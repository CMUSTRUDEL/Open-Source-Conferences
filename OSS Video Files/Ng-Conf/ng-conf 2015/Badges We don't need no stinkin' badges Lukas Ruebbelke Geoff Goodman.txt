00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,980
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: So welcome to the talk.

00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:09,380
I really believe that ideas change lives.

00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,400
How many people here would say that Angular has

00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,100
change their life?

00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,120
Raise your hand.

00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,200
Don't be shy.

00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,860
I think that everybody can say that Angular has changed

00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,680
their life in a profound way.

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,900
And I think it's safe to say that when Angular was just

00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,460
an idea in Misko's mind, I don't think

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,140
he ever imagined that he would affect

00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,280
the lives of so many people.

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,900
I think this conference is actually just profound and just

00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:47,740
irrefutable proof that an idea can impact a person's life.

00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:54,060
But at the same time, how many people

00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,390
have had a good idea that they let

00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:03,640
die because they were waiting for-- yes.

00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,260
We have.

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,950
We've had good ideas, and we let die

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,020
because we're sitting around waiting for our Club Awesome

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,835
badge to come in the mail.

00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:13,710
GEOFF GOODMAN: Did you get yours, by the way?

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,890
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: So I have not gotten mine,

00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,440
but I do believe membership-- you

00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,900
will know a member of Club Awesome

00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,530
by the amount of shiny clothes that they wear.

00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,620
So if anybody sees Ward Bell walking around,

00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,625
he is a regional director of--

00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:29,750
GEOFF GOODMAN: There he is.

00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,080
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Ward, yes-- regional director,

00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,520
Club Awesome, right there-- shiny clothes.

00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,010
So I'm Lukas, and clearly by that criteria,

00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,910
I am not in Club Awesome.

00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,800
But I'd also like to introduce to you

00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,340
today one of the most unqualified programmers

00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,280
that I know.

00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,733
He has proven to me-- he's taught

00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:58,830
me a very valuable lesson.

00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,490
And that is-- badges?

00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,240
We don't need no stinking badges.

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,220
We're going to show you exactly what we

00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,120
mean by that in just a moment.

00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,280
But first, how many people here have heard of Plunker?

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,700
I would say anybody who's been on the Angular site

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,530
has seen it.

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,610
It's pretty incredible.

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,740
What most people do not know is that Plunker

00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,750
was created by an accountant in his spare time

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,180
with no formal programming training,

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,200
completely self-taught.

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,470
And so I would like to introduce to you Geoff Goodman, who

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,290
in my life has completely obliterated

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,220
the false constraints and restrictions that I

00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,512
put on my life as a developer-- Geoff.

00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:51,120
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,350
Yeah, give it up!

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,112
GEOFF GOODMAN: Thanks, guys.

00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:57,430
Thanks, thanks so much.

00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,130
So my name's Jeff Goodman.

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,350
And sometimes it's tough to take Lukas seriously,

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,111
but no, it's true.

00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:03,860
I'm an accountant.

00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,680
I work for Ernst & Young.

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,772
All day I spend on Excel doing business valuations.

00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,230
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Why are you bragging about that right now?

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,550
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,852
But--

00:03:13,852 --> 00:03:15,560
GEOFF GOODMAN: Yeah, paper-- paper notes.

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,143
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: --what an accountant.

00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:18,740
GEOFF GOODMAN: So that being said,

00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,912
here I am at one of the best technical conferences

00:03:20,912 --> 00:03:22,370
in the world speaking to you today.

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,495
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: What could possibly go wrong here?

00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,536
GEOFF GOODMAN: Lukas, no.

00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:26,850
Lukas, we went over this.

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,460
I did a top-down risk assessment.

00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,140
And we covered everything-- everything.

00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,550
Well, almost everything-- there's

00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,540
only one thing that could go wrong.

00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,952
There's one totally unpredictable variable

00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:40,660
to this equation.

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,504
I think you guys know who it is-- Lukas.

00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:45,920
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: You have no idea.

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,990
Muha!

00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:52,360
OK, so let's start from the beginning with how we met.

00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,710
A few years ago, I did a workshop for Front End Masters.

00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,530
And I thought I was going to be so clever

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,030
and aggressively reduce all my dependencies.

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,900
And I was so clever, and I got all my dependencies down

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,262
to one, one dependency-- Plunker.

00:04:10,262 --> 00:04:11,470
GEOFF GOODMAN: How'd that go?

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,640
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Well, by one dependency,

00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,490
or single dependency, I mean single point of failure.

00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,660
So as you can imagine, that on the day of the workshop,

00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,374
Plunker is totally down.

00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:22,790
GEOFF GOODMAN: That didn't happen.

00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,290
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: It totally did.

00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,720
Don't lie.

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,200
And so I was furious.

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,370
I was ready to sue this horrible company that

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,680
was ruining my workshop-- how unprofessional

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,570
that they can't even keep their site up.

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:41,510
Well, after a series of Twitter exchanges,

00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:46,430
Geoff graciously agreed to help me with my problem

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,650
after he got home from work from his day job.

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,430
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,700
Clearly, the window of opportunity to be useful

00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,570
had passed at that time.

00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,650
But what I think is incredible is

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,650
that the site that I'd been using for months

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,400
had actually been written on the train back and forth

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,430
from Geoff's office.

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,220
And so I think what's also incredible about that is you

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,130
have a site that hundreds of thousands of people--

00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,250
I don't know the number.

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,080
You're a numbers guy, obviously.

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,280
Where's your spreadsheet with some

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,500
of the traffic for Plunker?

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,292
I want to see that.

00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:25,916
GEOFF GOODMAN: So I'm not going to bore

00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,190
you guys with a spreadsheet.

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,814
But there is this really cool tool,

00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:31,730
analytics-- I'm sure you guy guys all love it.

00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,020
I am absolutely fascinated by this.

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,415
At the beginning, I would stare hours and hours

00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:41,240
at analytics, totally blown away that five people could be

00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,910
on my website at the same time.

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,000
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Five.

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,930
Who are these people?

00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,410
Brand new world.

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,070
GEOFF GOODMAN: Who are these people?

00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,403
How did they hear about Plunker?

00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:48,950
Do they like it?

00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:57,830
So one step led to another, and now any time I

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,310
go on analytics, what I see is something more like this.

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,010
And that's something that makes me really, really proud.

00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,240
How can one humble accountant end up

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,310
with a website that's among the top 10,000 most

00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,640
popular websites in the world?

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,920
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: And so this is an example of another idea

00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,560
changing somebody's life.

00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,410
So what I like about this is Geoff

00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,360
was an outsider to the programming community,

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,910
that he was free to create something

00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,270
without worrying about what his programmer friends would think

00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,770
about him.

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,980
He didn't have any programmer friends.

00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,480
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,870
And so he wasn't waiting for external validation

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,170
to give him permission to go and build something awesome.

00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,412
He just did it.

00:06:44,412 --> 00:06:45,870
GEOFF GOODMAN: And so that leads us

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,020
to the one single most important point that we want

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,960
to get across to you today.

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,640
And that is, you do not need permission to be awesome.

00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,560
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: True.

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,920
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,880
I'll clap for that.

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,250


00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,130
So I want everybody for just a second

00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,900
to stop and think about-- imagine the developer

00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,639
that they want to be.

00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,430
I'm going to let that sink in for a second.

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,630
Just paint that picture.

00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,710
Now, we're friends here.

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,830
And so I want you to be honest with yourself

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,580
and think of the reason why we are not more

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,650
like that developer.

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:39,990
So I cannot speak for everybody, but I can speak for myself.

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,090
I put off being that developer and pursuing him in earnest

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,982
because I did not feel qualified to be that version of myself.

00:07:49,982 --> 00:07:51,440
GEOFF GOODMAN: So today we're going

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,080
to share with you three simple guiding principles that we've

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,050
been applying for the last couple years

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,354
and we think are incredibly useful.

00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:03,389
And what's next?

00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,180
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: And he gets his notes out.

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,100
All right, so these ideas stem from feedback loops.

00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,100
So one of my favorite books in the world

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,050
is "Adapt" by Tim Hartford.

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,920
And this really crystallized my world view on success.

00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,890
And the entire book is about feedback loops.

00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,590
Well, as software developers, we are very

00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,310
familiar with this concept.

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,620
Why does agile software development work?

00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,789
Because of feedback loops.

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,220
We do a meaningful unit of work.

00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,630
We put it in front of stakeholders, we get feedback,

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,380
and then we have an opportunity to do even more

00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,450
meaningful units of work.

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,600
Lean product development, same thing-- we build something,

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,020
we put it in front of a customer, we get feedback,

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,740
and then we keep iterating until we get the product just right.

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,770
And we build something that the customer loves.

00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,200
GEOFF GOODMAN: So I have absolutely no idea

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,970
what agile is, but this makes a lot of sense to me.

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,310
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: And so in a nutshell,

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,840
you take an action, you get a response,

00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,840
you analyze that response, and then

00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,870
you decide on a new action.

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,370
So this is really important because it

00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,840
doesn't matter about the quality or the outcome per

00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,090
se of your first action.

00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,080
All that matters is that you are committed

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,510
to adapting and making an improved second action.

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,000
GEOFF GOODMAN: So I just want to reiterate that point

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,940
and say that, do not prevent yourself

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,650
from taking that first action out

00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,790
of fear for the consequences of that action.

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,150
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Say that again one more time.

00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,430
I really like this.

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,250
GEOFF GOODMAN: Do not let the potential outcome of an action

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,075
keep you from taking that action.

00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:57,200
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Thank you.

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,405
GEOFF GOODMAN: So if you embrace the concept of feedback loops--

00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:03,780
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: I think that was

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,080
a feedback loop in his mike.

00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,260
GEOFF GOODMAN: Yeah, on the left side.

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,360
So if you understand the concept of feedback loops,

00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,970
you understand that you can take any action, no matter how

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,070
ridiculous that action is, as long as you

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,610
are willing to take the results of that action and adapt.

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,270
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: So that brings us to our first principle--

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,830
make mistakes.

00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,130
GEOFF GOODMAN: The first rule of Club Awesome, we've heard,

00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,460
is not to try and be awesome.

00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,910
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: So, Geoff, I think

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:38,240
it's time for some real talk.

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,460
So surely you have at least one great story

00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,550
about some colossal mistake you made

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,331
by putting Plunker together.

00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:49,330
GEOFF GOODMAN: Ah, yeah.

00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,031
So let's talk about how the first generation of baby plunks

00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:53,530
were made.

00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,830
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Kids, put your earmuffs on.

00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,730
GEOFF GOODMAN: No, don't worry.

00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,980
I'm going to keep this classy.

00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,860
You guys have all heard of dollar sign resource.

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,160
So I'm an accountant checking out this Angular Docs,

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,577
and I love programming, so I read everything.

00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:06,910
And I'm like, man, this is cool.

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,890
All I have to do is create a JSON object

00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,890
that maps file names to file contents, take resource, post

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:19,430
that to a simple express server, and store that in memory

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,420
at some random ID.

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,254
When someone asks for it again, just serve it back.

00:11:24,254 --> 00:11:25,670
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: So wait a second.

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,660
Are you saying that you stored all your plunks in memory?

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,551
GEOFF GOODMAN: Yeah.

00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:32,704
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:32,704 --> 00:11:35,120
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: I don't think that would scale very well.

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,610
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:39,260
So what happened if you needed to actually restart

00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,269
your server?

00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:42,310
GEOFF GOODMAN: Well, that was a bit of a problem.

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,050
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,091
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Clearly.

00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:45,870


00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,490
It's obvious.

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,517
Never restart your server, apparently.

00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:50,600
GEOFF GOODMAN: Yeah, so it was a bit of a problem.

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,020
So I was running on [INAUDIBLE] at the time.

00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,400
And I realized that between deploys or between server

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,860
restarts, there was one directory that was persisted.

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,090
So I took the next logical step and just serialized

00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,940
the whole database into temp.

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,290
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,230
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Yes.

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,370
I like that.

00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,816
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:17,277
So I'm mortified.

00:12:17,277 --> 00:12:18,110
I'm still mortified.

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,068
GEOFF GOODMAN: Yeah, I just wanted to point out

00:12:20,068 --> 00:12:21,900
that-- yeah, go for it.

00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,530
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: He's going to point out

00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,320
that I'm going for it.

00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,903
Thank you, Geoff, for your permission.

00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:26,179
GEOFF GOODMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,720
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: I think I had that same reaction as everyone

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,120
else did when he told me that, is that's

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,990
amazing and mortifying. right?

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,660
It's really pretty nutty.

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,130
GEOFF GOODMAN: So one of the earliest users of Plunker

00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,000
and part of the reason it became popular

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,430
is because Igor was a really early user of Plunker

00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,170
and a huge fan.

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:47,740
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: If he only knew.

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,690
GEOFF GOODMAN: And I'm sorry to say,

00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,910
Igor, but that's how your first plunks were stored.

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,160
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: You mad, bro?

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,050
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,210
You guys might not even be friends after this talk.

00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,340
But I will give you credit for not waiting for the right way

00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,330
to build things.

00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,330
GEOFF GOODMAN: Yeah, and that's the lesson here,

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:09,210
is that something that works, kind of,

00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,700
is a whole lot more useful than something that doesn't even

00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,260
exist.

00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,110
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Exactly, good point.

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:19,840
So let me use a phrase that a finance guy might understand.

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,400
Have you ever heard of technical debt?

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,650
GEOFF GOODMAN: Technical debt.

00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,060
So, yes, I would say that Plunker

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,870
was financed on technical debt.

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,770
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,540
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Yes, clearly we've made the case.

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,360
GEOFF GOODMAN: But it's online.

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,350
It's useful.

00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,190
A lot of you guys are using it.

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,900
And that's why I'm on stage here today.

00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,710
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: So speaking of useful,

00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,100
we can actually mitigate the risk of something breaking

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,140
by using something that already exists and that we know works.

00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,580
GEOFF GOODMAN: So that brings us to our second main principal,

00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,900
make compositions.

00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,316
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: And so by this we

00:13:57,316 --> 00:14:00,610
mean find solutions that are already working

00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,330
and put them together in a way that approximates

00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,630
what we're trying to build.

00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,210
So this is good for two reasons.

00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,030
So the first reason-- let us imagine,

00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,540
let us pretend for just a moment that I am the smartest

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,950
person in this room right now.

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,700
GEOFF GOODMAN: That's a lot of pretending.

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,700
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Let's pretend that Geoff is not

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,960
such a smart mouth right now.

00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,310
I am the smartest person in the room.

00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,940
But I have no chance of competing

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,780
against the collective intelligence and insight

00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,800
of any 10 people in this room.

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,220
The reason being is that the opportunity for feedback loops

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,320
and adapting is so much higher than a single individual trying

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,380
to solve something by themselves.

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,450
GEOFF GOODMAN: And it's also a lot faster

00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,450
to make compositions.

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,860
We're all here today because we love Angular,

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:56,400
and we know that it can allow us to make things so much faster,

00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,530
right?

00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,490
And that's exactly what we're talking about right now.

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,960
You use the tools that smart people

00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,630
have made to allow you to get feedback from your users

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,510
faster.

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,340
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: And so speaking of compositions, share

00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,830
with us some of the evolutionary progressions

00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,800
that Plunker has seen.

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,700
GEOFF GOODMAN: So I think we would all

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,870
agree that the setup I described earlier wasn't going to cut it.

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,340
So what I did, and I'm sure all of you

00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,780
have experimented with this at some point,

00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,652
I just set up a very simple MEAN stack with Ace.

00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:37,110
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: So I actually like

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,629
to call this stack the Amen stack.

00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:40,670
GEOFF GOODMAN: Just stop.

00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,467
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:42,800
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Don't judge me.

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,440
So I think we are actually not telling the whole story here.

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,070
What did it really look like?

00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,611
GEOFF GOODMAN: Well, OK, so it really

00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:53,080
looked a lot more like this.

00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,942
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: So it's "da" mean stack.

00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:55,900
GEOFF GOODMAN: Oh, boy.

00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,941
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: There's so much judging up here.

00:15:57,941 --> 00:16:01,610
So we don't have time to geek out on this.

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,620
But is this online for somebody to check out

00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,890
if they were interested?

00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,050
GEOFF GOODMAN: Yeah.

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,885
I'm not sure if any of you knew this or if all of you

00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,600
knew this, but Plunker, the version

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,802
that's online right now, is entirely open source.

00:16:13,802 --> 00:16:15,260
I will warn you, though, there will

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,470
be dragons and a whole lot of CoffeeScript.

00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,000
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: But no complaining.

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,580
So if you're tempted to complain--

00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,579
GEOFF GOODMAN: So if you're tempted to complain,

00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,190
I don't want to hear it, even the slightest bit of Ng Watt.

00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,460
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Plunker what?

00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,225
T-shirt time!

00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:29,972
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:30,562
Yeah!

00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:31,770
GEOFF GOODMAN: Nice reflexes.

00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,312
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: That's a little nod.

00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:34,228
Thank you [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:36,950
GEOFF GOODMAN: If you're feeling you want to change things--

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,340
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Pull a request.

00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,820
Feedback loops for the wins-- what is a pull request?

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,230
It's a feedback loop.

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,230
GEOFF GOODMAN: And so back to the feedback loop,

00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,450
I started out with this horrible implementation, right?

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,280
I made a whole lot of mistakes.

00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,220
But I learned a lot.

00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,500
I embraced compositions, put things together,

00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,250
and I kept refining what Plunker was made out of, right?

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,970
As JavaScript programmers, we all

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,280
know how lucky we are to have things like MPM, Bower, View

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,010
Source--

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,650
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Hashtag ProTip.

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,403
GEOFF GOODMAN: --and Stack Overflow.

00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:12,819
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: You get the idea.

00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,810
GEOFF GOODMAN: Yeah.

00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,069
I can't even imagine the hours that I saved.

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,140
I couldn't have even made this without all this.

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,560
(WHISPERING) I think we're running out of time.

00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,893
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: All right, so we're almost out of time.

00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:26,579


00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,485
Hi, Frosty.

00:17:27,485 --> 00:17:29,610
All right, we got one more point we've got to make.

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:35,410
So speaking of Frosty, this is our third and final principle--

00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,070
make friends.

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,730
So this is actually the principle

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,650
that I believe the most in.

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,870
The quality of our feedback loops

00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,610
are directly impacted by the quality of the people

00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,050
we surround ourselves with.

00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,600
Can I just have two more minutes?

00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,150
Just two more minutes.

00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,250
MALE SPEAKER: Hurry up.

00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,958
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Making the right friends

00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,446
can impact us in very obvious ways.

00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:57,070
GEOFF GOODMAN: Yeah, an obvious example

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,180
is that Plunker is online and totally free for all of you

00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,200
because we made friends with the awesome people

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,790
at MongoLab and at Modulus.

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,230
A less obvious but perhaps more important

00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,141
example is that it helped make Lucas a better person.

00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:13,890
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: So I'm really embarrassed

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:20,290
to say we actually have a very specific and historically

00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,060
documented example of this.

00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,540
But before I go any further, remember, you're on my side,

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,460
OK?

00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:27,960
Next.

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,230
Here we go.

00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,330
So when Plunker went down, I did what every developer has been

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,380
doing for hundreds of years.

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,280
I got on to Twitter, and I called somebody

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,890
a not nice name.

00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,190
Geoff, being the classy fellow that he is, told me to be nice.

00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,680
GEOFF GOODMAN: Lucas, being the classy-ish guy

00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,020
he is, totally apologized, and so mission accomplished.

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,360
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: And so that's where we became friends.

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,450
I want to show you one more example of a feedback loop

00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,325
that changed my life.

00:18:57,325 --> 00:18:59,774
MALE SPEAKER: [MOCK ROOSTER CROW] Is it done?

00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:01,440
GEOFF GOODMAN: Yeah, we're almost there.

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,210
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Almost there.

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,929
So I started blogging a few years ago, and not

00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,720
because I felt like I was qualified enough,

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,162
but I felt like I was invisible enough.

00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:13,620
And so I was excited about Angular.

00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,280
I wrote a blog post.

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,310
And what I did not know is that Angular was not quite as

00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,390
popular as it was today.

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,660
So Igor had time to actually get into blog post

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,890
and make comments.

00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:31,984
And so he dropped this epic gem in a blog post that I wrote.

00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:33,150
GEOFF GOODMAN: That's a gem?

00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,740
That looks a little bit more like a compliment sandwich.

00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,630
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: So that's exactly what it was.

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,760
Very nice post, a bunch of corrections and clarifications.

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,160
42 lines later, he then tries to smooth things over

00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,310
by offering me a free T-shirt.

00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,066
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:53,960
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,100
GEOFF GOODMAN: That worked?

00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,830
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Totally worked.

00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,560
And so instead of being mortified,

00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,431
I was actually excited to have that feedback loop

00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:04,055
and to improve.

00:20:04,055 --> 00:20:06,280
And so I continued to write barely passable blog

00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,110
posts and Migor and-- Migor.

00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,940
Misko and Igor-- I just trademarked that, by the way--

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,410
would come in, and they'd clean up my little messes

00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,560
that I left as I wrote blog posts.

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,940
And that led to us becoming friends, which, next slide,

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,190
led to this email.

00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,190
GEOFF GOODMAN: Right, is that the infamous front

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,210
end master's workshop that we--

00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,110
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: Of doom.

00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,068
GEOFF GOODMAN: Oh, boy.

00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:31,250
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: So I am actually here right

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,110
now because Misko was too busy, and I hit Reply

00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,190
before Joe or David could even blink.

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,350
Sorry, guys.

00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,220
You missed out on that opportunity.

00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,330
GEOFF GOODMAN: Are we really getting close to time?

00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:42,870
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: All right, we are actually

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,661
almost out of time.

00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:46,760
So just real quick, let's do a quick recap.

00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,270
This is a simple framework that Geoff and I use.

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,760
And we've applied it to our lives,

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,600
and it's extremely effective.

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,100
GEOFF GOODMAN: Yeah, the first step is to just do something.

00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,150
MALE SPEAKER: Guys.

00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:57,800
GEOFF GOODMAN: All right, come on.

00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,549
Just do something.

00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,780
Go make a mistake.

00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,739
You have to start that feedback loop somewhere.

00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:04,113
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: And once you know that something works--

00:21:04,113 --> 00:21:06,060
GEOFF GOODMAN: Or does not, in a lot of cases,

00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,819
iterate and change your composition.

00:21:07,819 --> 00:21:08,610
MALE SPEAKER: Guys.

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,734
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: All right.

00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:10,360
One second.

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,310
And when you really get stuck, it's

00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,600
your friends that are going to make a difference.

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,799
I think we can finish this.

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,590
MALE SPEAKER: Guys.

00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,850
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,225
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: So remember when

00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:21,300
I said I would show you exactly what I

00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,422
mean when I said, badges-- we do not need no stinking badges?

00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:26,380
GEOFF GOODMAN: Oh, buy.

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,796
LUKAS RUEBBELKE: I think it's time

00:21:27,796 --> 00:21:30,290
for a demonstration of what it looks like--

00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,256
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:35,180
--to make mistakes, make a composition,

00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,456
and make a lot of friends.

00:21:37,456 --> 00:21:39,886
Hit it!

00:21:39,886 --> 00:21:42,802
[CHEERING AND CLAPPING]

00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,232
[MUSIC MC HAMMER, "HAMMERTIME"]

00:21:45,232 --> 00:21:46,204
That's right.

00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:50,110


00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:54,410
[CHEERING]

00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:01,130


00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,010
GEOFF GOODMAN: I think Lukas is a member of Club Awesome now.

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:08,730
So before I let you guys go, just one last thing.

00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,710
Our friend Ari Lerner who really, really wanted

00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,484
to be here but couldn't, he's the author of the ng-book.

00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:17,150
I'm sure you guys all know what that is.

00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:21,950
And so he's offered to give three free copies to the three

00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,390
best stories we hear from you guys

00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,730
posted to Twitter on #noBadges.

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,650
Don't be afraid, no judgment.

00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:34,230
Send us the craziest, worst, most broken but cool hacks

00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,530
you have, and the three best will get free books.

00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,000
So thank you guys.

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,950
[APPLAUSE]
