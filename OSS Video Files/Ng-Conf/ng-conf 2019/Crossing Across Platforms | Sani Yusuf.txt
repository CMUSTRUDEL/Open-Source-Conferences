Title: Crossing Across Platforms | Sani Yusuf
Publication date: 2019-05-04
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	Web, Mobile & Desktop are the 3 standard platforms we develop for today especially in the Enterprise world. Each platform has its own unique features and needs. When faced with requirements where we need to develop one application for all 3, it can be a nightmare to get it right. How do you share code effectively? How do we solve a white labeling requirement? In this talk, I will show you based on a real-world Enterprise Healthcare application on how Angular can be the glue for such a monumental task where we will end up with a Mobile Solution, A Web Responsive Solution as well as a Desktop solution with electron while using 100% the same code base.

ng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.

00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:32,099
who are the people who are tired of the

00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:33,300

mean you talk to you about crossing

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,500
across platforms that's the title of my

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,000
talk and now of course well I can see

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,320
the faces a lot of people that what the

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,590
hell does that mean so hopefully in the

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,690
next 20 minutes ish I can you know tell

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,620
you what I hopefully mean by crossing

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,210
across platform so a bit about myself

00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:00,090
I'm gonna do this thanks to what's him

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,120
by the way for doing this my name is

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,739
sunny Yousef I am for I come from London

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,090
but I'm actually Nigerian so but I live

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,119
in London and I've done for the past

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:13,140
probably almost 10 years but yeah any

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:17,210
Nigerians in the house okay any people

from England Wow

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,180
alright so I spoke up Kiko hybrid which

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,890
is mostly just me myself and I but it it

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,590
sounds fancier when you say it's a

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,409
company I'm also a Google developer

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,930
expert which means I am lucky to get to

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,909
travel around the world and catch

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,570
educate people on a lot of stuff mostly

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,790
about angular and the web and many more

00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,229
so this one is a make or break between

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,520
my relationship between me you guys

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:50,700

I'm a huge fan like I love the movie

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,939
like literally I started learning the

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,039
language like I was at Disneyland every

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,509
time we had like a two-hour queue and I

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,310
was educating everyone about the movie

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:12,890
it's so like they even gave me a card

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,830
like in case I looking

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,700
job but yeah and I'm easy to find out

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,470
online

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,120
I'm literally signing use of every way

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,520
if you can find anyone that looks this

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,840
ugly without username and that is not me

00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,670
please let me know as quick as possible

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,000
right all right

00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,730
are you ready shall we begin liftoff all

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,830
right so I'm gonna paint a scenario to

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,410
you right you know when your life is

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,390
good right everything is happening you

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,510
know like you know you have a great job

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,790
you just nailed on this you know six

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,650
seven figure salary job like everything

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,690
is good you get to work remotely you

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,190
know you have well tested code as well

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:53,300
like you know how many people have well

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:55,220
test that code don't lie good all right

00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,640
you know you have well tested code see

00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,680
ICD you know unit test end to end test

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,080
integration test black box that's white

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,650
box says everything you know if you

00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,680
support football like football foot foot

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,150
with the foot exactly and if you follow

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,650
football on your football team is

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,900
finally winning you know Arsenal

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,160
football team greatest of all time you

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,130
know finally winning against the life is

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,600
really going good you know and summer in

00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:23,239
England is actually great which is like

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,250
unheard of like like we have a very very

00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,830
relationship with the Sun and like it

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,910
yeah it trolls us all the time England

00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,230
is the only country where you come out

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,000
the sun is shining but you still need a

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,040
jacket it's it's really confusing right

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,930
so normally when everything is going

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,120
good and live you know it's like you

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,400
know what could possibly go wrong what

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,420
could go wrong then this guy comes in

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,060
you know who this guy is he's the client

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,820
this guy he's the client and this is the

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,760
one guy that can fire everybody you know

00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,650
how by not paying you his money he can

00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,530
fire everybody that's your business guy

00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,930
and you know when the client comes and

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,310
clients always have this you know like

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,660
yo your manager you always feel like

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,940
your managers got your back but the

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,250
client comes and he's like nope nope I'm

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,220
with the client here so that he comes

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,739
along and they always have very

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,450
interesting requirements you know like I

00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:17,239
want my app to be able to work in the

00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,280
moon why because

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:20,840
Elon Musk has done that as well it's

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,849
something like that so what does it cry

00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,860
one you know and kinds I never shy of

00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:26,389
what they want you know so they want a

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,650
mobile application

00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:29,990
and they also want a desktop application

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,360
by the way if you hear me say like

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,699
desktop it's it's a Nigerian thing I

00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,909
struggle to say desktop so yeah I'm

00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,289
meaning the same thing so they want a

00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:40,849
mobile app and in desktop application

00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:42,949
right this is what the client wants

00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:45,740
this is demands and he has money and you

00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,659
have to figure it out and your manager

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,550
normally your manager suppose agree to

00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:51,949
have your back oh we can't do this or

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,539
you don't need that future no nobody

00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:55,580
says that to the client so this is your

00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:57,409
manager it's just basically do what the

00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,509
client says and normally they say

00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:01,430
something like this you have till the

00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:04,069
end of the month I don't know if it's a

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,779
it's a universal manager thing you have

00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:10,370
till the end of the month but like what

00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:12,770
is the 29th you know so and it's always

00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,960
never budget there is never budget you

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,340
know there's no budget for extra hands

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,080
you know stuff like that

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:23,330
and your manager probably ends up with

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:27,259
like good luck all right okay so this is

00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:29,270
you this is you poor old you what do you

00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:31,460
do because nothing is working at this

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,560
point in time right you're late hours

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,589
you gotta you gotta call the wife and

00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,800
you know the husband you know it's just

00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:41,870
not working so let's talk about what you

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,360
already have as a solution what do you

00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,449
actually already have you have a web

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,729
application built probably on a server

00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:51,830
technology so most likely you know

00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:55,339
something built with like net you know

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,899
or Java or PHP you know something like

00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:59,300
that while you already have a standard

00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:02,779
web application right you this has been

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:05,120
tested and tried it's been working for

00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,560
years you know everybody's scared to

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,939
chain that particular line because the

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,849
guy that wrote it is already dead you

00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:13,099
know and exactly and the last guy that

00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:14,719
tried you know it didn't quite work

00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:17,330
there was one time I used to maintain

00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:18,830
this code base where there was a counter

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,319
of the amount of time people have tried

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,899
to refactor the code and it was like I

00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,339
won 134 so you try to refactor it and if

00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:27,439
you fail then you increase the counter

00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:31,069
for the next person so it was like a

00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:33,229
warning so this is normally the first

00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:34,940
attempt you take to solve that problem

00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:38,000
your client and remember needs a mobile

00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,169
app and a desktop application now to go

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,740
hand in hand with this

00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:42,170
right

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,610
so you probably be like okay you know

00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,590
you do your little reading you're going

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,200
to stack overflow still some codes do

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,910
you know we all do it you know and so

00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,650
you probably create a separate project

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,090
for your mobile application so you

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,000
probably create like a native

00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,500
application right and you also create a

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,240
separate repository for your desktop

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,340
application because you need to support

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,990
Windows and Mac and Linux and things

00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:06,800
like that so this is probably your first

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:09,080
attempt makes sense everything right but

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,530
and you probably think life's all good

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,660
right no this is the things that will

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,600
you probably didn't consider the first

00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:20,240
one is you know how do you share code

00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,310
across all these platforms right you

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,640
totally forgot about that one the second

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,680
one is you know what we have some people

00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,270
that use Android phones and we have some

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,890
people that use a specific device where

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,400
every year they remove a feature but

00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:35,690
people still queue up to buy it right

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,230
they start off by making the thing

00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:41,180
smaller and then they remove the whole

00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,530
motor or there's no buttons now right

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,380
next year they'll probably remove the

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:47,240
screen I likes the iPhone but guess what

00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,550
for some reason people queue for three

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,430
days and buy it I don't know why right

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,350
so and you also forget that Android and

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,550
iOS have different set of tools you're

00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,620
writing different completely different

00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,930
languages or no Java or Cartland if your

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,800
fancy objective-c the most beautiful

00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:05,960
language ever made or Swift you know and

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,550
you probably need more hands because you

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,440
cannot do this you're used to writing

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,900
server technology so these are these are

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,980
the things you not only don't consider

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,200
it's not because you're not a great

00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,760
developer it's just it's a blind spot

00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,750
right on till you get into did you

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,050
create this application you're like oh

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:23,300
damn it bloody ell I actually need to

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,120
think the thing about this again so and

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,850
this is you at that time like but you

00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,580
need this job you really need this job

00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,110
you just had a baby you know you know

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,480
you're paying off your student loan you

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,730
really just need this job so how do you

00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,430
solve you probably go to the boss we

00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:42,950
need some hands and they're like no we

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,870
don't have any budget so let's see how

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,030
we can solve your problem right let's

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,920
see how we can solve that problem the

00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,350
things you want in theory because the

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,480
greatest way to solve a problem is like

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,890
envision what you actually want

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,120
which is very hard like if you ask

00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,910
yourself what do I want that's a very

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,470
hard thing like you know so you want the

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,270
ability use the same technology across

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,220
all platforms that would be nice

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,270
that'd be nice I can work with the same

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,640
technology across all these platforms

00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,170
that way I don't have to retrain or if

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,760
I'm hiring I just hire people and they

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,920
can just hit the ground running right

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,240
you want to be able to write the same

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,770
program in language you know I don't

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,350
want a case where I'm writing Kotlin

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:20,180
here today Java here if you if you if

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,080
anyone here has maintain code bases that

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,790
requires you to write different

00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,750
programming languages you probably know

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,060
what I'm talking about

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,830
that stuff is not healthy all right like

00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,470
I've seen people quit and like go to

00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:34,100
music or something because just it never

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,360
works out you share code bases easily

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,460
that's what you want you want to be able

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,810
to use a future here on this application

00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,760
and use the same feature somewhere else

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,380
right and you want to use the same build

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,270
processes right we've seen how

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,980
everybody's talking about basil in this

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,320
particular conference because it's just

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,850
much easier we've seen about the mono

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,830
repo way away it's just much easier to

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,600
centralize stuff either our natural

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:56,030
instinct is to like separate stuff it's

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,400
pretty cool until we get hurt and then

00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,560
realize it's a bad idea right so let's

00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,560
make a case for angular right let's make

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,510
a case for angular why angular first why

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,300
will we make a case for angular right

00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,890
that's the question that because we you

00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,330
don't want to assume a technology before

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,610
you actually solve a problem you want to

00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,880
see why does it fit my needs and all of

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:19,160
that so let's see these are the reasons

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,200
why you'd probably want to use angular

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,310
first the rich API angular right the

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,680
first we're going to talk about is

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:27,560
reactive forms has anyone used reactive

00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:34,190
forms here okay anyone still using

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:36,050
template forms how no word no say no to

00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,460
the template forms trust me every time

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,860
you use the template form an innocent

00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,350
kids in some will dies or something like

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:45,080
that it's bad bad bad for business just

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,060
don't write so use reactive forms which

00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,770
allows you to build really complex forms

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,760
because guess what most applications we

00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:53,870
build actually just data input data out

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,000
majority of apps you use that's

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,590
literally what they do right what's up

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,420
is that I think was bought for 30

00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,520
billion dollars it's a glorified list

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,170
it's a list of people you don't care

00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,810
about and you message them once in a

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,880
while and that's it Gmail use it every

00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,890
day it's a glorified list

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,110
it's things you don't want to answer and

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:15,530
that's it everything facebook is a

00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:18,290
glorified list I mean there is like you

00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,580
know yeah there might be said Cambridge

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,410
analytical thing going on behind the

00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,780
scenes but at its core it's a glorified

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,420
list so you have things like HTTP client

00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,510
which allow you to do really robust rest

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,350
calls you know crud operations

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,540
interceptors a lot of things for

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:35,360
enterprise this is very very important

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,310
right and you have like really really

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,220
robust routing if you work in angularjs

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:43,310
and you know how crap that router was no

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,900
disrespect if we ever created it but you

00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:47,900
know Victor did a wonderful job with a

00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,760
router in angular because it really I

00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,400
think we realized that a lot of people

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,720
wanted to do more stuff so we needed

00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,850
more and localization

00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,400
internationalization you know we forget

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,410
that like a billion people actually read

00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,730
from right to left why we actually all

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,680
as human being started reading from

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,390
right to left until you know Inc and

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,760
then it just didn't make sense because

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,680
then you swipe the ink and when you come

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,210
back and right but the cavemen were like

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,890
thinking King King King so it was like

00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:20,960
right to left anyways another day and

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:22,670
localization and also components you

00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,990
want to be able to build linear little

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,510
chunks that you can just throw around

00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,860
everywhere and that's just like that's

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:31,520
what we want you want to have

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,750
componentized things right so other

00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,190
future is that maybe we don't even talk

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,520
about about angular cuz there's a ton of

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,130
them

00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,690
it's very enterprise friendly right

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,270
server-side rendering of a universal so

00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,680
if SEO is really critical for you or you

00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,930
know mobile first paint is really

00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,250
critical this is pretty cool and the

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,930
last one is actually the one I really

00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,030
like super community there's a fifteen

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,450
hundred of us here in this city of Salt

00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,430
Lake City

00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,620
all because we care about one specific

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,880
technology you know so this is really

00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,920
really kind I was having a chat with Mir

00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,320
mishko I was like you made this possible

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,060
I know we all do but look look at look

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,030
at what this is this is what you've made

00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:06,950
possible you know so this is a

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,300
hypothetical use case for our

00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:11,960
billion-dollar company does it make

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,640
sense right we want to have mobile iOS

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:18,140
Android Windows if you still use a

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:21,230
Windows Wow you know get a new phone but

00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,550
web mobile web desktop PWA

00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,140
these guys right you wanna have

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,060
something light it's pretty cool billion

00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,190
dollar application which we can then go

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,960
to San Francisco and raise crazy amount

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,330
of money and then exit even though it

00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,360
doesn't do anything you know make sense

00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:36,500
all right all right so the web solution

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,370
you'd have something like this where you

00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,260
have your app you know use angular and

00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:45,740
you'd write some JavaScript with it

00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:49,550
right and you'd also write a super set

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:51,440
which is typescript of course and you'd

00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,240
probably use the SP a route which is the

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,680
traditional angular out or you go you'd

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,780
Universal if you really need to do

00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,230
server-side technology right in several

00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,730
rendered application now we have another

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,190
one for the mobile as well you are at

00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:07,870
your mobile code you know you use

00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:11,660
angular right JavaScript with a

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:13,910
typescript and you'd probably want to go

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,320
with something like ionic because if you

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,150
you really want to stick to the web

00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,040
focus stuff but if you really need

00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,240
native natively render stuff native

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,210
script is another really great

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,580
alternative that you can really hook him

00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:29,270
that way you still get to use angular

00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,310
across all your applications right and

00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,630
then for the desktop solution you

00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:35,420
probably have something like that with

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,100
electron very similar right but at the

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,860
core you're you still writing pretty

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,120
much the same code you know using

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,640
angular using typescript using

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,740
JavaScript all of that right and you

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,730
know you would be able to support my SX

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,970
and Windows and Linux

00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,320
right now we've envisioned the solution

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,060
but how do we make it actually

00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,890
practically work that's the most

00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:59,510
important thing so how do you actually

00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:01,400
share code on that level and so the CLI

00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:04,040
to the rescue that's the most important

00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,870
thing you can do ng generate an

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,370
application so this is a new thing and

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:10,280
now you can even go on steroids with

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:13,970
schematics with NX sorry you can even

00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,920
like have workspaces with an X I'm a bit

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,570
more vanilla so I still like to use this

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,070
this is a traditional thing but what it

00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,720
does allow you to be the CLI is to

00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,270
generate these other applications so you

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,270
can generate another app in the same

00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:28,460
repo using the same response package

00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,020
that JSON and now you have integrations

00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,610
for native script you have integration

00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,460
for ionic as well so you can just add an

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,540
NG add an ionic application but this is

00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,699
also another thing

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,959
generate library and I given Mike a hard

00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:40,759
time over the past years to make this

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,160
happen and he finally did which allows

00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,440
you to create a library write a sheer

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,529
set of components that you can use a

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,600
shared sort of authentication files that

00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:52,370
you can use things that you can be share

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,529
that you can just require those as

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,300
modules in these other mini applications

00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:58,610
right so you end up with something that

00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,620
looks very similar to this where you

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,870
have your web application in the same

00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,370
repo the mobile application with ionic

00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,470
or native script and you have the

00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,690
desktop electrode application and then

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,750
you have that shared library and then

00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,699
you can do things like that and you know

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,370
momona repo is very very great shared

00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:19,009
library and then you can use you know

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:21,350
important you can share the code as ng

00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:23,480
modules I actually have gone further to

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,100
use component inheritance to take pretty

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,230
much this on steroids so what you can

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,819
have is you can have what I call shadow

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,670
components these are components that

00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:33,680
just have specific like detail and then

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,970
you can inherit them and then extend and

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,850
I will talk about that shortly as well

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,860
right so sorry wait I have a weird

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,930
scenario because you know clients right

00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:45,620
and this is actually based on a true

00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:47,269
life experience that I had to solve like

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,560
that's this was a point in my career I

00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:49,790
was very honest with myself if we don't

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,410
solve this problem this could make or

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,579
break me because I'm not sure mentally

00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,250
be able to recover from that from that

00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:57,769
loss so we have a kind of legit did that

00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:01,100
and we said you know you have these

00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:02,870
three applications but you know you have

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,240
some shared modules and components right

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,890
but the components have some shared

00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,000
logic so they behave the same way across

00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:13,100
but they also have platform-independent

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,929
behavior because for the mobile the

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,370
clients want something to look pink

00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:19,130
while on the web he wants it to look

00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,870
blue why because he's the client I mean

00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,990
he's got the money you just have to do

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:26,839
what he says or else you get fired what

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,549
do you do right and this is the case for

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,620
this is white labeling now you have a

00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:32,990
solution you have tons of clients you're

00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,120
dealing with but you want that one kind

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,520
I want an added future if you add it to

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,110
the core then it could break everything

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,030
for everybody else so how do you add a

00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,919
specific feature for this one person

00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,290
that it doesn't break everybody else's

00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:48,090
code and that's very very important so

00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:49,770
normally this would be like the very

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,780
the visualized way to solve this problem

00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,570
you know you have like a div if it's

00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,370
mobile then render it this way if it's

00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,740
web this is like your component right we

00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,990
all do this now it's okay I'm not gonna

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,720
tell anybody but you know if it's if

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,670
it's web like use this piece of code if

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,260
it's mobile do this but you know what

00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:10,590
this is called you end up with something

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,940
we call a god component it's a component

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,350
that's trying to do anything and it's an

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,380
actually legit like that actually

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,820
there's a legit cold snow the cold

00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,520
summer I kid you not it's called

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,080
inappropriate intimacy that is you can

00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,880
check this out on the refactoring book

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,470
the real this is what in approach

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,020
inappropriate intimacy looks like

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,150
because it's like why's desktop mobile

00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,250
and web live in the same place they're

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,420
there they're speaking to each other but

00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,250
they shouldn't and that's the name of

00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,830
the code code code smell that's a code

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,990
you're going to get hurt at some point

00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:44,070
if you continue doing this right so how

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:46,020
do you solve this problem right so you

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,030
use component inheritance to actually

00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,100
solve this problem so you'd go you

00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:52,740
create what I call a shadow core base

00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,450
component right in that shared code

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,070
library and you'd have something like

00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:57,870
that and you implement some shared

00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,190
function right and you don't give it a

00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,110
template because the templates are never

00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,880
inherited in it's just that even the

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,910
Select is anything in the decorator is

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,010
not inherited just the class right and

00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,720
you can also inherit inputs and outputs

00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,940
and you can override you have the same

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,680
object-oriented behavior and then what

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,270
you do is you then create the same

00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,730
component but maybe it was something

00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,320
like mobile so like my live component

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,520
and then we create in my mobile live

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,900
component so you create another

00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,870
component what all these components do

00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,820
it is inherited from that base component

00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,770
but then you can put the mobile specific

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,200
specifically the specific features there

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,360
the mobile specific inputs there right

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,970
so that way when you change this

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,370
particular piece of functionality

00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:40,560
everybody else doesn't get affected

00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:42,270
right but also if you extend a specific

00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,310
feature that is shared across everybody

00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:46,110
else just gets that feature we all go

00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,780
home happy and if you have a client that

00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,340
wants even it's very client specific

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,470
future for the mobile then you can

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,360
further extend and create a client

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,700
specific component that inherits from

00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,440
the cryo mobile component and then you

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,500
can get write client specific code there

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,800
and everybody goes from happy that way

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,710
you

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,540
you leave everybody in their rooms

00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,130
pretty cool stuff so problem solve right

00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,100
I believe you

00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,590
do you agree we've solved the problem

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,680
maybe maybe not but what about

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,420
white-label is this is the case right

00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,580
yeah you know you have a core app client

00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,800
a client by client see like that how do

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,440
you you know you have a skeleton core

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,510
app application and the coop itself is

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,910
only an abstract so like a shell type of

00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,100
view where based on the clients JSON or

00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:36,540
XML if you really want to kill yourself

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,980
you know then you have some logic to say

00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,840
is you want to like sell the same thing

00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,150
to different customers things like that

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,760
some customers want specific different

00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,050
things so you can use something that

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,540
that looks like this you can configure

00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,890
what I call configurable modules so

00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,200
pretty similar to what angular actually

00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,970
does or any other third-party module we

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,950
use firebase where you configure from

00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,320
the outside so in our case for example

00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,600
we had multiple clients but each crime

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,940
was almost a separate application and

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,280
the server side they have their own you

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,230
know authentication rules and all of

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,860
that right so we had to have something

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,780
services that were not specific to just

00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,130
a kind but were almost morphed based on

00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,530
the client and you use something like

00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,570
that so use injection tokens right and

00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,370
this ensures that each white-label a

00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,350
police's is old configuration so you

00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:25,800
configure from the outside and then it's

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:27,270
just more at runtime right and you can

00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,710
use component heritance too on this

00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,720
level even though it's a bit dangerous

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,090
so this is something you'd have that

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,790
looks like this where you'd configure

00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:37,740
this and now basically that

00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,930
configuration comes from the outside and

00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,810
then you use the for root for child type

00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:44,220
away very similar for consistency you

00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,930
create a static function and the

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,970
injection token is what you configure

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,170
from the outside so step very similar to

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,670
what you do with firebase when you want

00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:53,520
to use firebase on an app you provide

00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:54,810
like a an object that has all your key

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,020
value pairs but you can use it for

00:21:54,810 --> 00:22:00,090
multiple applications right and this is

00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:02,160
what you would have so for a specific

00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,230
application you just configure from the

00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,930
from the for you from the outside that

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,940
way now you have this module that works

00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,740
and you can create services also that

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,270
are very that and I use the same

00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,740
injection token and do the same thing

00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:17,230
right and that's a we've literally

00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,880
in the end I will say something let your

00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,710
requirements speak I can come in and

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,750
tell you this is how you solve this case

00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,429
or that case or that case but please oh

00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:27,010
please your requirements should always

00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:28,540
dictate which path you take you know

00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,940
this might not be the case for you but

00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,530
it covers a lot of cases so always be

00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,570
loyal to your requirements that's the

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,890
most important thing because if you get

00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,480
the requirements wrong then you're

00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,790
really in big trouble with everybody

00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,730
both the client both the boss and

00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:45,309
definitely someone's getting fired

00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,929
but yeah so at this point I will say

00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:50,400
thank you very very much and I welcome

00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:50,400
any questions thank you very much

00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,650
[Applause]

00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:05,269
