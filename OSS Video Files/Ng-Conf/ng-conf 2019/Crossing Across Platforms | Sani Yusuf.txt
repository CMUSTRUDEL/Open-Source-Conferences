Description: 
	Web, Mobile & Desktop are the 3 standard platforms we develop for today especially in the Enterprise world. Each platform has its own unique features and needs. When faced with requirements where we need to develop one application for all 3, it can be a nightmare to get it right. How do you share code effectively? How do we solve a white labeling requirement? In this talk, I will show you based on a real-world Enterprise Healthcare application on how Angular can be the glue for such a monumental task where we will end up with a Mobile Solution, A Web Responsive Solution as well as a Desktop solution with electron while using 100% the same code base.
