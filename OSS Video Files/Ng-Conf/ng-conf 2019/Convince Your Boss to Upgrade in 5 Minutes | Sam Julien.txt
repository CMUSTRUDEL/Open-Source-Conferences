Title: Convince Your Boss to Upgrade in 5 Minutes | Sam Julien
Publication date: 2019-05-02
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	Upgrading to Angular is a waste of time and money!

That’s what your boss will say if you don’t come prepared. You and I know that Angular is better, faster, and stronger than AngularJS. We know that the CLI rocks. We know that NgRx helps us build better applications at scale. But we’re developers — we care about nerdy stuff like state management and tooling.

You think your boss cares about that stuff? Heck no! So what does your boss care about? Spoilers: it’s money.

If you’re stuck working in AngularJS, selling your boss on upgrading can be tough, especially since doing your job correctly means no one will be able to tell a difference! In this short and sweet talk, Sam Julien is going to teach you how to decode “business-speak” and convince your boss to migrate from AngularJS to Angular. You’ll learn how to use empathy and persuasion to help your boss see clearly how the leap to Angular isn’t just good for you — it’s good for the bottom line.

hey everyone how are ya man I'm so

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,720
thrilled to be here I love the angular

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,689
community so let me take you back a

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,210
couple of years ago to my last job in

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,580
downtown Portland and I'm on a walk with

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,000
my boss Shane on one of our famous

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,079
walking one-on-ones downtown and before

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,420
you say anything I know what you're

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,579
thinking you're thinking Sam I've seen

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,690
Portlandia I can totally picture this

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,760
and you know what it's exactly what

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,280
you're thinking first of all we work for

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,739
a renewable energy nonprofit I'm not

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,890
making this up

00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:54,870
yeah Shane is wearing head-to-toe

00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,899
Columbia outdoor wear and holding his

00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,559
signature iced coffee and I am wearing

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,030
what else flannel

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,409
so today on this walk we're talking

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,530
about the same thing that we've talked

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,260
about for our last 50 one-on-ones the

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,900
upgrade situation more specifically

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,750
today how do we convince the business to

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,340
upgrade from angularjs to angular how do

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,830
we convince them of something that if we

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,920
do our jobs right the users probably

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,600
will never know the difference and

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,000
project managers love this right you're

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,310
telling me that if I spend tens of

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,070
thousands of dollars and hundreds of

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,170
hours that my app is basically gonna

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:38,070
look the same

00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:40,890
what so on this walk I've just come back

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,290
from ng-conf 2017 yes this very

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,880
conference two years ago miss you shy

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,890
and Alyssa and I arrived feeling just

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,570
like that panda like super frustrated

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,299
that I couldn't figure out the migration

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,299
path luckily I was able to go to Joe's

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,969
ng upgrade workshop and awesomes talk on

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,229
gradual migration and I was able to talk

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,030
to a lot of other developers at the

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,969
conference to get some great ideas on

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,429
migrating so like a JavaScript Luke

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:11,849
Skywalker coming back from training with

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,870
ng Oda I've now arrived back in Portland

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:17,069
to Shane

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:19,110
with a solid plan for migration so as

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:21,299
Shane and I walked towards my favorite

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:26,069
art is no hand roasted pour over coffee

00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:29,700
shop I'm excitedly prattling on to Shane

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:33,540
about things like rxjs and observables

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,329
and banana in a box syntax that one that

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,879
one took some explaining let me tell you

00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:41,879
when Shane stops me whoa whoa whoa Sam

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,470
hold up hold up reel it in you've got to

00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,569
help me convince the business that this

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,549
is actually a good idea so what do you

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,319
think the project manager and the

00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:53,730
product owner care about you think they

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,920
care about rxjs he's got me there well

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,109
they want new features to get developed

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,909
they want bugs to get fixed they want no

00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:01,829
disruptions in any of this and most

00:02:59,909 --> 00:03:05,609
importantly they want to make more money

00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:09,090
and spend less of it bingo says Shane

00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:10,859
classic Shane responds by the way so

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,920
we're gonna have to smuggle in the

00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:15,329
upgrade Sam alongside the other projects

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,299
we already have scheduled for the year

00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:20,400
oh so you mean like when you're working

00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,840
on a car engine and you just want to

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,090
like replace the water pump at the same

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,549
time as the rest of everything right

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,069
right exactly but my question to you Sam

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:31,590
is are we gonna have to go back and

00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:34,650
refactor all the legacy code first

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,540
before we even get started I sidestep

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,239
the new relic developer is lining up for

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,220
brunch at the food carts no no what

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,590
we're gonna do Shane is we're gonna set

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,720
up a hybrid app in our next project with

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,790
ng upgrade and that way we can start

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,489
writing new features in angular now and

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:54,290
then go back and refactor the legacy

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:56,609
code over time Shane is thrilled by this

00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,109
well well that's fantastic and that

00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:00,030
means we're gonna have fewer bugs with

00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,859
typescript we'll have faster features

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,769
with angular all of which means a

00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:08,040
smaller backlog and you know more money

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:10,410
in the budget we high-five high-five our

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:14,690
way into the coffee shop and raise a

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:17,430
compostable cup to our planning prowess

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:20,489
a few months ago Shane and I got back

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,919
together to reminisce over a beer about

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:24,590
our big upgrade project and we did a

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,400
really good job because we were able to

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,410
set up for nude

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,449
helpers to write new features in angular

00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,600
now and then go back and refactor the

00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:35,490
legacy code over time I also talked to

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,949
Shane about my plan to move to an

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,320
organic farm in Washington but that's a

00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:42,479
