Description: 
	Apps of all sizes need to manage state, but not all apps need a state machine like NgRx. What if we can’t afford the code cost? What if we don’t want to decouple our business layer? The quick answer might be “inputs! outputs! subjects!” But there’s more to Angular state management than just getters and setters or a global stream. Let’s set up readable, uncomplicated state management using behavior subjects, observables, and immutability — all OnPush ready. In this talk, we’ll explore a couple of approaches for reactive state management in Angular.
