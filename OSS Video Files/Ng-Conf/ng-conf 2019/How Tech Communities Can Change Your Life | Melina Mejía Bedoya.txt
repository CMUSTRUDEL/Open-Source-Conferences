Title: How Tech Communities Can Change Your Life | Melina Mejía Bedoya
Publication date: 2019-05-04
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	About a year and a half ago I started attending tech meetups in Medellín and I never thought my life would change so much since the first day I attended.

In this talk I want to talk about my experience beeing part of tech communities in Medellín and how it has positively impacted not only my life, but that of many others:

– Thanks to “Pioneras Developers” community I was able to overcome the impostor syndrome and change the paradigm that programming is a “boy thing”.
– In Angular Medellín I found a place with people with the same interests I had, willing to listen, to help, where it didn’t matter if you had never code or if you had 30 years of experience, everyone is welcome. The most important thing about being part of this community it wasn’t to have a computer, but the attitude with which you came to learn and share knowledge, to challenge your limits.
– After a long time attending to this meetups, I realized I wanted to get more involved, I wanted to impact the lives of other people. So I signed up as a volunteer in the project “Code your future Colombia”, whose main objective is to change the lives of disadvantaged people in Colombia, in this case “Comuna 13”, one of the places most affected by violence in my city.

ng-conf is a three-day, single track Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe will be here all week at Salt Lake City, UT to participate in trainings by the Google Angular team and other Angular experts.

and I want you to get to know me a

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,910
little bit better so this four things

are the ones that I enjoy the most

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,340
learning languages I am currently

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,070
learning Korean drawing Japanese manga

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,799
listening to music and watching movies

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,530
in series

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,049
all my life I've struggled with impostor

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,420
syndrome I used to think that I wasn't

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,400
good enough and that I was crazy for

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,060
thinking that I could be on another

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:25,860
country giving a talk like this so this

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,740
is my journey on March 4 2017 my life

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,220
completely changed I went to a meet-up

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,439
in the gene a beautiful city in Colombia

00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:37,140
to a group called canaras developers and

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,780
there I found a place where I wasn't

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,299
afraid of asking questions I met a lot

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,340
of women who were willing to help me to

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,040
guide me and to clear all my doubts I

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:52,380
love that we celebrate together when one

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,240
of us reaches her dreams when I was in

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,850
college it's time for my bachelor's in

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,219
computer science I saw that I was

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,009
entering into a profession dominated by

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,770
men I realized there were only five

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,039
girls including me in a class of 40 to

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,319
50 students and Dana did some research

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,689
and I found out that in Colombia only

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,569
seven out of every 1,000 women are

00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:18,840
developers of technology and around the

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:21,810
world about 25% of women on computer

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,739
jobs are held by women as you can see we

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,989
are very few in this field and thanks to

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,420
Pinellas I realized that we need to

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,849
empower girls so that we can break the

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:39,900
paradigm that says programming is a boys

00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:40,650
thing so a few months later in the same

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,930
year

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,690
I found another meet-up and you learn me

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,180
the gene and when I got there this thing

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,180
was very different there were a lot of

00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,500
guys and only a few girls they're

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,959
exactly the opposite of what I'd seen at

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,819
donators and this made it clear to me

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,010
that there is a problem with diversity

00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,829
and inclusion in our field and that we

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:05,190
need to work on it going to these

00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:07,799
meetups events has allowed me to meet so

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,810
many new people in a fielding have even

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,449
became some of my closest friends and

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:17,099
they inspire me every day to do better

00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:20,310
and to challenge myself this six people

00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:24,419
have had a huge impact on my life

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:26,849
in my career after discovering these

00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,769
meetups I decided that I wanted to try

00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:32,010
something completely out of my comfort

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:34,560
zone I asked if I could give a talk at

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,870
angular MIDI gene on my experience of

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,660
learning to speak English and they

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,239
accepted and on the day of the talk I

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,489
remember that I was freaking out that my

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,049
hands were shaking and my voice sounded

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,900
really really strange

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:52,260
Brene was the only way to face all my

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,209
fears going to these communities

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,449
connected me with more and more people

00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:59,609
and then I started to take talks

00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:02,190
workshops conferences and networking

00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:06,120
events that eventually helped me to

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:08,069
reach all my dreams at the end of last

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,470
year I found out about a project

00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:13,560
starting in a gene called coda future

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,750
Colombia this project was founded in

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,650
England with the aim of teaching Syrian

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,630
refugees how to code and this guy Bram

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,210
the incredible idea of bringing the

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:28,530
project to meta-gene in nineteen middle

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:30,720
register as a volunteer our main goal is

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,440
to reach the most vulnerable people in

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,960
metagenes

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,479
the community's life community our team

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,520
that have been impacted by violence and

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,930
the people with the scarce resources who

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:46,830
don't have access to this education so

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:48,960
this is my life now I am a front-end

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,120
developer who gets to help so many

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,250
people thanks to all the support and

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,580
encouragement I received over the last

00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,800
three years and now I can impact other

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,860
people's lives I can share my knowledge

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,750
for free and I can help the world so

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,930
that everyone can have the same

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:10,670
