Title: Data Composition with RxJS | Deborah Kurata

Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	RxJS is one of those technologies we use every day, but there is always a bit more to learn. In this session, we focus on making our code more reactive by:
– Collecting data from a backend server using a declarative approach
– Composing data streams to handle foreign key and aggregate relationships
– Caching the streams in a service so they can be readily reused
– All without a subscription!
Join me as we get to know more about data composition with RxJS.
