Description: 
	Angular grew significantly in the past few years from both a tooling and developer experience standpoint. This talk will explore many of the features and newer improvements in the pipeline that allow anyone to build and deploy performant apps with very little overhead.

Through real demos and examples, we’ll cover Ivy, bundle budgeting, differential serving, automatic code-splitting, and more! In the second part of the talk, we’ll focus on how to efficiently prefetch and preload different modules and components.

ng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.
