Title: Avoiding The Suck Of Testing Using Cypress.io | Joe Eames & Jesse Sanders
Publication date: 2019-05-03
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	The state of application testing for Angular is broken. Angular applications are composed of UI components running in a browser, but our most effective testing strategy has been unit testing functions instead of UI interactions. The recommended strategy for testing the UI is Protractor, which is built on Selenium, a technology originating in 2004 when the web was all server-side rendering. This workshop will show you the flaws in your current testing strategies and how to most effectively test your applications using Cypress. Jesse Sanders and Joe Eames will walk you through why your current test strategy fails and how to test your applications with less time and effort. They will guide you through installation, configuration, and best practices for writing tests using Cypress. This hands on workshop will guide you through multiple testings scenarios that will provide you with the necessary skills to handle even the most complex test cases
