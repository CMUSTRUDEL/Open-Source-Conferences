Title: Why Humans Need To Move To Mars | Stephen Petranek
Publication date: 2019-05-02
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	The talk will start by examining just 7 (of many) ways life on Earth as we know it could end suddenly–from an asteroid impact to our creation of new life forms in a lab that turn against us. Then we’ll explore how people will get to Mars, why that will happen with or without NASA’s cooperation, how we’ll live on Mars and build entirely new civilizations, and how we can eventually terraform the planet to make it more like Earth. The big surprise is how quickly all this will happen because space is about to become the biggest business on Earth, and how many people will end up there, including many of your children.

ng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.

00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,170
[Music]

00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:18,600
hello people of Earth well I have some

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:24,029
good news and some bad news

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,130
I'm going to start with the bad news we

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:31,170
all think of this place as our permanent

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:33,239
home but it actually cannot be that this

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,380
planet doesn't care if we survive or not

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,360
and it's a lot tougher than we are

00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:44,579
that's why our place on this planet is

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,379
hardly guaranteed so consider this 99%

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,960
of all the species that have ever lived

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,930
on earth have gone the way of this guy

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,930
the woolly mammoth a magnificent

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:59,699
creature in species time we had a great

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:02,430
run 1600 years that's pretty good we

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:05,280
Homo sapiens have been around earth for

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,140
three hundred thousand years and its

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,260
might be time that we're running out of

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,000
luck there are a lot of reasons we can't

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,930
survive here permanently

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,270
and if nothing else ever gets us our Sun

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,610
will eventually begin to expand and

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,680
either it will throw earth entirely out

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,659
of its orbit as it does this which it's

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,909
a normal consequence of what happens to

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,340
stars or it will consume us in a

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,310
fireball of radiation and nothing will

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,170
be alive on this planet and in the

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,240
meantime we live in kind of a dream

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,909
world as if we aren't actually

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,750
threatened by dozens of extinction

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,520
events and let's look at a few of them

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,670
take for example tiny life-forms we

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,909
can't even see without magnification

00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,840
viruses

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:54,299
this one is h1n1 that's the original flu

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,560
virus that caused the last disastrous

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,840
worldwide pandemic back in 1918 it was

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,409
called the Spanish flu despite the fact

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,759
that it originated in New Jersey and a

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,250
third of all the people in the world

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,940
were infected by it and it killed a

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,650
hundred million the Spanish flu came in

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,959
three waves or mutations

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,549
but it's the second wave that's

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,650
important because that way of that

00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:21,900
mutation was a hundred percent fatal if

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,230
you got that version of the flu you died

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,450
no offense or buts and it's only a

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,180
matter of time the Centers for Disease

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,610
Control will tell you before another

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,569
deadly flu like this emerges again and

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:39,840
it could be this one h7 and 9 it's an

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,879
avian flu so far a few hundred people in

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,069
China who handle chickens a lot and get

00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,109
the blood on their hands and maybe a cut

00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:49,230
on their hands have died from this

00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:52,829
the CDC considers it the prime candidate

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,720
for the next worldwide pandemic now this

00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:58,079
bug is not easily transmissible to

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,000
humans yet but the CDC worries that it

00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:02,849
will eventually join forces with an

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,859
ordinary flu virus and the result of

00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,920
that is called a recombinant virus and

00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:10,680
it happens when a deadly bug like h7 and

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,450
9 that normally stays in animals happens

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,299
to get into someone who already is

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,430
infected with a common flu then those

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,069
two viruses nestle up against each other

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,560
and they trade genes they form a new

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,980
super virus that easily moves from

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,989
person to person and we have not one

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:32,910
single cure for any virus on this planet

00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:36,480
we have no vaccines for the scariest

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,780
ones and new ones lurk everywhere about

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,609
a decade ago craig Venter the guy who

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,099
decoded the human genome sailed around

00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:46,650
the world in his yacht sorcerer 2 and

00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,750
every few days he collected some

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,690
seawater and sent it back to his labs in

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,810
Maryland in every liter of seawater they

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:58,799
found a minimum of a million previously

00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:02,099
unknown viruses okay so let's move from

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,620
the little to the big our Sun spits out

00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:07,440
huge bursts of atomic particles called

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,739
coronal mass ejections about four times

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,019
every 24 hours they're deadly but they

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,489
almost always miss us and to understand

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,769
why you have to think of the Sun as a

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,650
basketball and then think of the earth

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,630
as a BB and now move that BB a mile away

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,450
from the Sun for the relative distance

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,830
that we are from it we're a very small

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,820
target for a coronal mass ejection

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,160
because

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,560
the Sun is a sphere and can it shoot its

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,530
stuff out in thousands of different

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:38,160
directions but that's not to say we

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:40,590
haven't been warned in 1859 a coronal

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,070
mass ejection destroyed the new u.s.

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:46,800
Telegraph system almost all the wires in

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:50,550
that system melted causing hundreds of

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,650
fires and many operators had their keys

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,390
on the Telegraph key or their finger on

00:04:52,650 --> 00:05:00,830
the Telegraph key were shocked

00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:03,060
unconscious we can live through these

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,490
eruptions thanks to our protective

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,710
magnetosphere a magnetic field around

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,470
the earth created by its spinning molten

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:13,350
iron core where earth is kind of a

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,630
generator essentially but a direct hit

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,000
would kick us on our ear taking the

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,040
power grid out and every satellite in

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,470
orbit and plunge us into a 19th century

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,870
existence without electricity or

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:29,400
communications no cell phones no ATMs

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,530
imagine trying to replace every

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,750
telephone wire every power line every

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,660
internet cable every server every

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,700
computer the trucks that we depend upon

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,220
for food distribution simply wouldn't

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,620
start nor would tractors in agricultural

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,190
fields there's a three-day supply of

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,890
food in America's grocery stores most

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:53,130
cities would become uninhabitable within

00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:57,360
a week and 50% of the population would

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:59,310
be homeless ok first thing I'll admit is

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,090
that a solar flare can't actually wipe

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:05,610
out the human species so how about this

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,350
we now know by studying other g2 stars

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,860
which is the kind of star that our Sun

00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:15,630
is that they tend to brighten by about

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:17,760
2% every 50 million years that means a

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:22,560
blast of particles and radiation that

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,960
would destroy our atmosphere here you're

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,240
looking at a synthetic genome invented

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,730
nine years ago and insert it into a

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,750
bacterial cell to create a new life-form

00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:36,210
that never before existed on the earth

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:39,510
that was an amazing leap but that was

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:41,820
nine years ago very soon

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,760
most high school students will have

00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:48,120
access to the equipment that will allow

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,610
them to create new life forms and the

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,170
goal is noble control what a cell does

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,630
and you can make it do almost anything

00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:59,490
you can throw it down an oil well and

00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:03,000
it'll eat the oil and it'll as a waste

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,620
product give you methane you can make

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,990
synthetic vaccines with them and we

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:11,190
might need those you can make synthetic

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:13,050
medicines or you can even take co2 and

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,290
turn it into a usable fuel with the

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,800
right kind of new life forms on earth

00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:22,860
what could possibly go wrong

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,960
well think of smallpox Ebola and the n7h

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,680
9 flu I just talked about and combine

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,900
those together in one virus on purpose

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,610
now think of suicidal terrorists who are

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,920
dissatisfied with killing only a few

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,980
hundred people at once in the wrong

00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:41,630
hands a super bug like that could spread

00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,630
around the world and kill every human

00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,680
more more bad news now let's look at

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,450
artificial intelligence and that's the

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,550
Curiosity rover on Mars it's an

00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:53,490
incredible machine but it can't think

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,410
the new Rover we send to Mars next year

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,140
with our TIFF we'll have artificial

00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,300
intelligence support and that's because

00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,390
curiosity takes 48 hours to do what a

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,550
human can do in two hours if we see a

00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:10,350
rock in front of curiosity like you see

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:12,990
here controllers on earth have to design

00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,850
software to tell it what to do I mean

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,850
the transmission of the message from the

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:20,370
signal about the rock to earth and then

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,900
if the it forgot how long it takes to

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,370
write the software that's a couple of

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:27,540
days but then to send it back that

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:29,460
round-trip is 45 minutes alone this

00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:33,479
Rover has been on Mars for seven years

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:35,310
and traveled 13 miles now an AI version

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,890
of the Curiosity rover could make its

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,140
own critical decisions in real-time and

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:45,000
that is going to be an absolutely

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:47,040
brilliant advance but wait doesn't that

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,450
mean we can build killer drones that

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,149
make their own decisions it does

00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,040
and I leave you this with this one

00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:57,050
thought about artificial intelligence

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,779
that Stephen Hawking actually foresaw

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:03,350
the one thing that AI can do better than

00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:06,110
anything else right now in 2019 is it

00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:09,380
can track the movements of every human

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:14,779
on earth every minute of every day just

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:17,870
ask China one thing a super intelligence

00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:21,769
can't control is our unstable planet not

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:24,410
be far not far below our feet everything

00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:26,660
is essentially molten goo the Earth's

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:29,360
crust is only 5 miles deep beneath the

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,630
oceans and it's only 25 miles deep under

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,850
the United States and everything else is

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:38,269
the forms most of the earth is basically

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:40,880
lava and it often breaks through the

00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:42,470
crust the biggest extinction events in

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,680
Earth's history have been caused by

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,480
super volcanism the entire subcontinent

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,430
of India was formed when the earth

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,410
opened up and lava flowed out for

00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,149
centuries

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,250
volcanic activity can send so much ash

00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:58,670
into the atmosphere that it mimics the

00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,680
aftermath of a nuclear war and just one

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:04,640
volcano can threaten worldwide

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:07,850
starvation in 1815 Mount Tambora in

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,470
Indonesia blew its top it was followed

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:13,010
by something called the year without

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:15,140
summer snow fell throughout New England

00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,269
in July and August and Frost's were

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,279
common all across the United States all

00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:20,449
summer

00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:23,540
people in North America and Europe

00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:29,180
rioted because food prices quadrupled

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:31,610
and there's another unstable heat source

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,430
we have to worry about which you which

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,260
you probably know all about which is co2

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,670
just over 30 years ago the mean and that

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,740
was just 30 years ago the mean

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,170
atmospheric temperature on earth was 14

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,930
and a half degrees centigrade it's gone

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,060
up a full degree since then scientists

00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:50,240
say if we go up another degree Earth's

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:54,230
climate will go haywire as if it hasn't

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,600
started already and all five of the

00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,940
biggest extinctions in Earth's history

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,030
have been characterized by rapid

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,060
increases in co2

00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:08,530
and despite the Kyoto Accord

00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:10,660
co2 levels continue to go up crop yields

00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:13,060
around the world have been going up for

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,970
40 years they're now starting to level

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,920
off and soon they will decline and you

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,450
can see this in the wave of immigrants

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,490
who are coming to the United States from

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,800
Central America because coffee

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,230
plantations in Central America

00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,320
due to changes in climate are failing

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:32,080
left and right and things could get a

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,790
lot worse a 4 degrees rise in

00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,520
temperatures which is much more likely

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,920
than the 2 degree rise we hope for could

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:44,830
actually cut the u.s. production of corn

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:47,170
in half and if co2 levels get fairly

00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:50,320
high we get maybe a 9 degree rise in

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:52,450
temperature will our brains will no

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,150
longer get enough oxygen and we'll lose

00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,250
cognitive ability but by then we'll have

00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,940
artificial intelligence to fall back on

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,770
now we all know about the horse of

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,200
nuclear war but most people only think

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:07,350
about war between superpowers which so

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,000
far have shown themselves to know better

00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:12,790
there's a larger potential threat that's

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,880
far from the control far from our

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:18,460
control on the Indian subcontinent both

00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:22,960
India and Pakistan have about a hundred

00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:24,990
and fifty nuclear warheads this video is

00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,280
not running there we go

00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,780
both India and Pakistan have about a

00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,640
hundred and fifty nuclear warheads

00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,130
they're adding to that by about 20 more

00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,589
heads a year and both countries have a

00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:38,740
triad delivery system for their nukes

00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:40,950
now land sea and air both Pakistan and

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,480
India are building nuclear submarines

00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,640
both countries are increasing their

00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,760
nukes every year and both are developing

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:51,010
Merve dwarves an all-out exchange

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,930
between these two countries would create

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:57,940
a nuclear winter that kills everyone on

00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:59,680
earth finally there's an asteroid

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,740
problem there are about a hundred

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,720
million of them out there and right now

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,250
in our solar system somewhere in the

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,370
asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:11,830
or in the cooper belt that's far beyond

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,850
pluto there's a large asteroid with our

00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,699
name on it

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,759
a seven mile wide asteroid took out the

00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:21,309
dinosaurs 65 million years ago when it

00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:24,009
created fire storms across the planet

00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:26,859
and a winter that lasted hundreds of

00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:30,160
years nothing larger than a rabbit

00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:32,559
survived what we face is not a matter of

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,369
if this happens again it's only a matter

00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:38,439
of when there are tens of thousands of

00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:41,079
asteroids between Mars and Jupiter that

00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:44,289
could destroy life on Earth hundreds of

00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:46,269
them are 60 miles across and there are

00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:48,789
10,000 objects called near-earth

00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:50,559
asteroids that interact with Earth's

00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:53,379
gravity and actually travel around the

00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:56,319
Sun with us this is a look at what a

00:13:53,379 --> 00:14:00,459
satellite has seen recently all those

00:13:56,319 --> 00:14:03,129
grey dots are asteroids the yellow ones

00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:04,619
are comets the green ones are near-earth

00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:09,819
asteroids

00:14:04,619 --> 00:14:11,109
that's a lot of trouble one day you

00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:13,149
could wake up and read a headline that

00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:14,649
says large asteroids sighted on

00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:16,689
collision course with earth

00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:18,729
and if we haven't built a redundant

00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:21,129
system to knock it out it will be too

00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:24,429
late to actually build that system and

00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:26,229
fire it off at that incoming and what

00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:28,149
happens after that is kind of beyond

00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:30,309
horror because most humans won't die

00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:35,079
when the impact occurs they'll die of

00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:38,379
starvation now NASA is working on this

00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,069
but it's really slow progress this is

00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:41,470
Dart

00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:44,499
the double asteroid redirection test

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,059
it's an attempt to use blunt force to

00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:48,759
see if we can change the course of an

00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:51,009
incoming asteroid we're sending a

00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:53,289
spacecraft the size of a car to smash

00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:56,999
into this little asteroid one that would

00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:59,679
would do what we call regional damage at

00:14:56,999 --> 00:15:01,689
13,500 miles an hour we hope it will

00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:04,869
shift the course of this asteroid by

00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:07,350
four tenths of a millimeter per second

00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:10,929
that's about a hundred feet a day and

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:13,749
even if it works we will have to

00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:16,179
identify a dangerous asteroid at least

00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:20,249
five years before it heads our way and

00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:23,859
that's rather unlikely now the good news

00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:26,259
all of these threats to the continuation

00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:26,499
of humans on earth argues strongly for

00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,719
de

00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:31,749
helping an ability to be a multi-planet

00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:35,109
species and think about this for a

00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:37,839
minute for 95% of our history humans

00:15:35,109 --> 00:15:39,959
have been nomads who reached out beyond

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,369
the next horizon and into the wilderness

00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:45,879
they learned that moving on was a matter

00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:47,519
of survival Homo sapiens have as I've

00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,929
said before have been around for about

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,949
300,000 years but we only started

00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:55,299
staying in one place 20,000 years ago

00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:58,569
grouping together in towns and growing

00:15:55,299 --> 00:16:02,439
crops and domesticating animals moving

00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:05,409
on may be built into our DNA and I don't

00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:07,989
think we should fight it our immediate

00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:09,669
goal should be to go here if we can

00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:12,129
learn to build a city on Mars that's

00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:14,739
self-sustaining we can learn how to

00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:17,109
become a spacefaring species that

00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:19,869
eventually travels far beyond Mars and

00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:21,609
far beyond our solar system and I'm not

00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:23,409
talking about a few astronauts going to

00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:25,389
Mars picking up some rocks and heading

00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:27,549
home I'm talking about millions of

00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:30,489
people living on that planet and far

00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:32,679
sooner than you would think it won't be

00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:35,589
easy because Mars isn't as much like

00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:37,659
Earth as we like to think it is for

00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:39,549
starters the atmosphere is super thin

00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:42,249
about a hundred times thinner than

00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:44,379
Earth's and it's 96 percent carbon

00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:46,929
dioxide when we breathe more than about

00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:51,869
5% carbon dioxide and you can practice

00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:54,489
this with a with a paper bag we pass out

00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:56,289
it's also cold on Mars the average

00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:57,939
temperature is minus 81 degrees

00:16:56,289 --> 00:17:01,299
Fahrenheit but that doesn't actually

00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:03,489
represent real temperatures because they

00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:05,259
can't get as high as 70 degrees at the

00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:07,389
equator on a nice day on Mars in the

00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:09,579
summer but that same night the

00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:12,939
temperature could plunge to minus 100

00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:15,009
and gravity on Mars is far less than it

00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:18,069
is on earth because and in fact of the

00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:20,589
fact that gravity on Mars is 38% Earth's

00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:25,059
gravity tells you exactly what size Mars

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:27,159
is it's 38% the size of Earth so in Mars

00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:29,289
you can do really cool things like jump

00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:30,639
over your car rather than walk around it

00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:32,139
and if the atmosphere we're a little

00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:33,820
thinner you could kind of put on bat

00:17:32,139 --> 00:17:36,029
wings and you could take a jump and you

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,869
could probably fly a couple hundred feet

00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:39,730
but we actually have little

00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:42,280
understanding how will react to low

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,350
gravity over a long period of time we've

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,720
just discovered for example that zero

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:49,960
gravity on the International Space

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:54,190
Station for extended periods will cause

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:57,790
human eye sight harm permanently and

00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:59,650
Mars is a long way away the moon is 250

00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,540
thousand miles away from us it took

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,130
Apollo astronauts three days to get

00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,080
there

00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:08,200
Mars is a thousand times farther away

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,360
than the moon and despite what you hear

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,309
about some optimistic projections of how

00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,760
long it will take us to get there it

00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:17,799
will probably take eight months despite

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,020
our successes with recent Rovers to Mars

00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:22,210
our record of getting to the red planet

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:24,220
isn't so great

00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:26,549
we've sent more Earthlings have sent

00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:30,970
more than 50 missions to Mars and

00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:33,940
two-thirds of the mr. crashed so this

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,500
isn't easy to get there but it is doable

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:39,280
and that brings up an interesting

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:41,669
question how soon will the first humans

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,650
actually set foot on the Red Planet

00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:47,799
now NASA says it should be able to land

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:50,230
humans on Mars in the 2040s and I think

00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:53,620
that's true but that will be a little

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,419
capsule with seven guys in it NASA

00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,760
definitely should be able to put people

00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:00,730
into orbit around Mars sometime in the

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,049
mid 2030s but frankly I don't think

00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,140
they'll bother because I think people

00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:07,330
will already be there and that's because

00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,630
this guy is determined to make it happen

00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:12,340
that's Elon Musk and he's the CEO of two

00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:15,640
companies that are obviously changing

00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:17,919
the world Tesla motorcars and SpaceX his

00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,450
rocket company has one mission and one

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,600
mission only that's it

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,850
build a self-sustaining city on Mars of

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,220
at least a million people and everything

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,200
this company decides to do from day to

00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,900
day month to month year to year is based

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,460
on that mission statement that's why a

00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,910
lot of people are working there instead

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:40,740
of at NASA must think SpaceX will land

00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:44,440
humans on Mars by 2024 perhaps 2025 and

00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:48,370
just three years from now in 2022 they

00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:51,760
will attempt to huge cargo landings on

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:53,080
Mars here's some footage from the

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,840
National Geographic

00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,450
documentary series we shot this is kind

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,340
of outtakes before the first Falcon

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:15,910
heavy rocket was actually launched last

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:18,550
year well maybe not that humanity will

00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:21,880
have a base in the moon and a city on

00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:27,400
Mars in our lifetimes in our lifetime

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:30,490
yes yes hopefully if Falcon Heavy spire

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,930
people are thinking about Mars because

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,220
you know there's all these defensive

00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,840
reasons of like we want to be a

00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,300
multi-planet species and then having a

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,980
life insurance policy in case I mean bad

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,720
happens to earth but I've personally

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,430
never find that nearly as motivating as

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,770
the excitement of being a spacefaring

00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,630
civilization in multi-planet species and

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:48,180
beginning out there among the stars and

00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:53,020
seeing what the universe is all about

00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:55,360
that might add incredibly inspiring now

00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:58,240
here's the point governments and their

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,240
robots and we must always be super safe

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,390
attitudes no longer control the space

00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,210
game private companies are making space

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:10,060
a huge business and before long they'll

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,370
be happy to take you to Mars every year

January to launch eight very small

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,760
satellites into into low-earth orbit but

00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,850
besos is building a much bigger rocket

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,310
called new Glenn and it's bigger than

Elon Musk's Falcon 9 and it's even

00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:24,560
bigger than the Falcon Heavy we are

00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:26,750
witnessing a weird competition among

00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:31,570
billionaires to see whose rocket is

00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:34,460
biggest and there are a lot of players

00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:31,510
asteroids and there's a lot of Google

00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,510
money invested here too

00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,539
the mission of planetary resources is to

00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,909
expand the economic sphere of influence

00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:40,830
of humanity into the solar system and

00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:42,779
that's a big goal but one that's

00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,149
achievable through the pursuit and

00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:47,220
development of resources in space to

00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:49,139
enable not only the further exploration

00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,059
and development of space but the benefit

00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:53,039
of the economy right back here at Earth

00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:55,710
and when we looked at what were the most

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,419
accessible resources of the hundred

00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:00,110
million asteroids in the solar system

00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:02,760
there's about 1 percent that are

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:04,260
energetically very favorable meaning

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,380
they're easy to get to and easy to get

00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,700
back from and so it also turns out that

00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,940
those near-earth asteroids are

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,919
chock-full of fuels and precious metals

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,080
and industrial metals the very first

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,659
resource that's the key to opening up

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,710
space is the simple molecule of water

00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:24,570
and we know that h2o is very plentiful

00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,519
on the earth asteroids we know that our

00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:29,970
long-term goal to prospect and mine

00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:31,620
asteroids is audacious today behind me

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,899
is the completed market the sixth

00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,940
satellite destined for its mission later

00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:38,190
this year each of these satellites is a

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,110
strong step forward towards the ultimate

00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:43,139
goal of prospecting and mining resources

00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:45,090
in space we want to know if water is

00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:47,730
there we want to know if iron is there

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:50,549
we want to know the nature of those

00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:53,010
resources everything we've held a value

00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:56,070
on earth metals minerals energy real

00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:58,409
estate fuels those are out there in vast

00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:00,269
quantity we are gonna be the company

00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:02,190
that knows the most information about

00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:05,610
the potential asteroids of high value

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:09,659
out there we are going after the

00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:11,730
greatest gold rush ever the most

00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:13,740
valuable thing planetary resources are

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,659
looking for is water and here's why and

00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,720
when you split the water molecule you

00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:20,730
get hydrogen and oxygen and those just

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,970
happen to be the most common fuels for

00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:28,260
rockets that we know of and oxygen will

00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:30,360
also keep people alive in space but

00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:33,000
space isn't just a big business it's

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,480
world politics now and NASA's budget is

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,850
in decline meanwhile the Chinese and the

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,940
Russians investments in space are

00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,620
actually increasing we cooperate with

00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,730
the Russians on the International Space

00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,100
Station as well as

00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:49,620
Japanese the Canadians and 11 European

00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:53,429
countries but we don't let the Chinese

00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:56,160
in for security reasons so they built

00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:57,870
their own space program two months ago

00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,580
they landed a rover on the dark side of

00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,100
the moon that's never been done before

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:05,250
and they will launch their own space

00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:09,179
station in 2022 and they will go to Mars

00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:12,330
and Vladimir Putin is also very serious

00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:14,040
about a race to Mars there's kind of an

00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,470
interesting story most people don't know

00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,140
which is when Kennedy announced that we

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,510
were gonna do a moon shot the head of

00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,750
the Soviet space program at the time

00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:26,940
went to Nikita Khrushchev and said you

00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:30,150
know we can beat the Americans and Chris

00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:32,340
Jeffs said to the moon and he said no we

00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:35,340
can go to Mars and they probably could

00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:38,820
have the technology for doing this is

00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,740
that old no modern nation that wants to

00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,620
get to Mars will have a problem doing it

00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:47,059
for example the United Arab Emirates

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:51,210
will launch a lander to Mars next year

00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:54,090
so this is a doable proposition and we

00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:57,510
have had the technology for about 40

00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:59,190
years to do it but staying alive on Mars

00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:01,770
is another story

00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,870
now NASA may not be the first to land

00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,690
people on Mars but it does know how to

00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:08,610
keep them alive once they get there

00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:11,100
let's look at the problem this way you

00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:14,520
need food water shelter and clothing to

00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:17,640
live on earth and you need oxygen as

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:20,070
well to live on Mars and as I've said

00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,890
before the most important item is water

00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:25,590
it's the basis of all life forms that we

00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:27,990
know of but it weighs 8 pounds a gallon

00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,610
and it costs more than 12,000 bucks to

00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,700
take a gallon of water to Mars from

00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:34,320
Earth so we have to find it on a planet

00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:37,140
that looks a lot like the deserts in

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,500
Colorado and Utah and fortunately Mars

00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:43,290
isn't actually like that the soil is are

00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:46,380
the surface of Mars is very dusty but it

00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:49,799
contains up to 60% water in the form of

00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:52,559
ice orbiters have shown us and that is a

00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:55,620
real photograph the lots of craters on

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,240
this planet have ice in them this is the

00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,880
Korolev crater in the northern

00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,700
hemisphere

00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:04,000
it's 50 miles across and a couple

00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,770
thousand feet deep the six active

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,530
satellites that are searched that are

00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:11,610
circling Mars right now also tell us

00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:14,679
they're huge glaciers of ice on Mars and

00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:17,700
last year Italian scientists revealed an

00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:21,610
underground lake on Mars of liquid water

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:24,039
there probably many more of these and if

00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:26,620
all if all the surface ice on Mars were

00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:30,010
to melt the planet would be 300 feet

00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:33,280
deep in water but digging up this ice

00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:37,210
and melting it requires huge equipment

00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:39,280
and lots of energy so this is how we'll

00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,789
have water when we want it at least in

00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,190
the beginning

00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:45,120
a device cooked up at the University of

00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:47,919
Washington back in 1998 called wave are

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,530
your HVAC guy would call it a

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,890
dehumidifier it only has one moving part

00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:56,530
and it can extract plenty of water from

00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:58,659
the Mars atmosphere because every night

00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:01,600
because of the cooling of the atmosphere

00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:05,440
on Mars the atmosphere turns just about

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,929
100% humid and the next critical need

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,240
for survival on Mars is oxygen and for

00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:11,380
that I introduce you to MIT scientists

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,140
Michael Hecht

00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:17,200
now dr. Hecht has developed a machine

00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:21,360
called moxie and that stands for moxie

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:24,490
Mars oxygen in situ resource utilization

00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,100
experiment I think I got that right but

00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:29,409
it basically it's a reverse it's a kind

00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,990
of a reverse fuel cell and it can take

00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:34,570
in the Martian atmosphere separate off

00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:40,179
the carbon atom and leave you with pure

00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:43,270
oxygen and a co2 molecule is 78% oxygen

00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:45,730
once you take off the carbon next year

00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,740
NASA will send an entirely new Rover to

00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:50,169
Mars as I've mentioned and the moxie

00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,299
device will be abort and it will produce

00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:55,140
enough oxygen to keep one person alive

00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:58,120
indefinitely but that's just for testing

00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,520
NASA intends to build a version of moxie

00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,440
that's a hundred times bigger and we'll

00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:05,409
send it to Mars within the next six

00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:08,140
years and they will also send storage

00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:10,450
tanks and then this huge Moxie device

00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,460
will fill those storage tanks with

00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:14,760
liquid oxygen

00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:17,310
for future Landers to be used both as a

00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:19,850
fuel for return flights and to keep

00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:23,190
people alive on the planet

00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:25,590
now what about food we will use

00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:27,660
hydroponics and aeroponics to grow some

00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:30,120
food on Mars but it's really tricky to

00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,710
do this in a greenhouse on Mars for a

00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,800
lot of different reasons so we probably

00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:38,700
won't grow more than 20% of our caloric

00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:41,040
intake on Mars at least not until we can

00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:43,620
make liquid water flow on the planet and

00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:46,830
we can actually grow crops outdoors and

00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:49,970
I will get to that in the meantime food

00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:52,980
will have to arrive from Earth dried and

00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,900
then there's shelter at first we can use

00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,060
inflatable pressurized buildings but

00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,830
radiation is a huge problem and you need

00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,350
some pretty thick walls between you and

00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:03,120
the radiation on Mars

00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:05,310
fortunately the Martian soil is kind of

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,980
ideal for making bricks and NASA's

00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:10,110
engineers to the rescue they figured out

00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:13,500
how to throw a little polymer into the

00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:16,440
soil and make a form and throw it into a

00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,510
microwave oven and out pops a brick or

00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,580
maybe we'll live here in a partially

00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:23,220
underground dome designed by architect

00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,260
by Erica Ingels that is actually being

00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:29,120
built in the desert of the United Arab

00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:31,830
Emirates as a test for their Mars colony

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,600
the inflated plastic dome could actually

00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:35,550
be filled with water to help block

00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,600
radiation you only need about a meter of

00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:41,760
water buildings inside the dome descend

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,040
into the Martian soil offering

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,490
increasing protection from radiation the

00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:49,650
deeper you go and these are buildings

00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:52,350
that architect Norman Foster designed

00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:54,300
their 3d printed from the Martian soil

00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:56,520
and they can be built they were designed

00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,400
to be built by robots before humans even

00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,670
get there they're kind of the bulk

00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:04,590
attempt at building buildings and

00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:07,380
finally there's clothing on earth you

00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:09,600
always have 15 pounds of the atmosphere

00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,640
pressing down on you at all times and

00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,250
your body is actually designed to push

00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,300
out against that on Mars as we've

00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,490
mentioned there's very little

00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,680
atmospheric pressure so without a

00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:21,830
spacesuit you would start expanding and

00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:25,319
look like the Michelin Man pretty soon

00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:27,659
but Dava Newman a scientist from MIT has

00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:29,909
created a sleek lightweight spacesuit

00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:32,009
that looks more like an exercise outfit

00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:34,079
it keeps you together it blocks

00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:35,759
radiation and it keeps you warm and has

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,449
a lot of metallic fibers in it

00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:42,569
that's her modeling up so food water

00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:45,989
shelter clothing oxygen we can do this

00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:48,289
and that leads us to the next logical

00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:50,339
step in the good life on Mars

00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:53,129
terraforming the planet to make it more

00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:53,519
like Earth to do that we have to warm it

00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:56,669
up

00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:59,249
Mars is cold again because of that very

00:34:56,669 --> 00:35:01,289
thin atmosphere and the answer lies here

00:34:59,249 --> 00:35:04,949
at the South Pole which is covered in

00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:07,049
frozen carbon dioxide dry ice it's just

00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:10,469
barely frozen it's just cold enough to

00:35:07,049 --> 00:35:13,259
to turn into a crystal if we heat it up

00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:15,869
just a few degrees that dry ice will

00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:18,900
sublime directly into a gas just as it

00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:21,150
does on earth and as we know nothing is

00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,690
quite as good at creating a greenhouse

00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:26,729
effect as good ol co2 my favorite

00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:28,769
proposal to heat it up is a highly

00:35:26,729 --> 00:35:32,339
reflective solar sail in orbit around

00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:36,269
Mars so that it focuses the sun's rays

00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:38,459
on the South Pole 24/7 within as little

00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:40,979
as twenty years the temperatures on Mars

00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:43,380
would actually begin rising and before

00:35:40,979 --> 00:35:46,019
long surface ice at least near the

00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,029
equator would melt and that would add

00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:50,099
water vapor to the atmosphere and water

00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:53,369
vapor is actually a very good greenhouse

00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:54,959
gas as the atmosphere thickens

00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:57,420
everything would get better we'd get

00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:59,880
more protection from radiation and more

00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,009
atmosphere would trap more heat which

00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,630
would create more water vapor going in

00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:06,359
the air which would trap more heat etc

00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:08,549
and within a few decades you would have

00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:10,650
streams and lakes on on Mars probably

00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:12,799
within 20 degrees north of the Equator

00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,420
in 20 degrees south of the Equator and

00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:17,489
then we could actually grow crops out

00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:21,599
dorit's clouds would form and it would

00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:23,999
rain on Mars and eventually some of the

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,209
planet could be made to feel a lot like

00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:28,949
southern Canada we'd still be left with

00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:30,599
a complicated problem and it is a

00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:32,190
complicated problem of making the

00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,039
atmosphere breathable that could take

00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:37,170
hundreds of years but humans are smart

00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,670
and remarkably adaptable remember that

00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:42,300
there were no airplanes 100

00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:44,310
20 years ago there's also no telling how

00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,620
quickly genetics could help us we're

00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:49,080
actually on the edge of mastering our

00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:52,230
own genetics in real-time being able to

00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,770
change genes in your own body in real

00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,440
time

00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:57,390
so we could end up with one species of

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,340
human on earth and a completely

00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:01,530
different species of human on Mars that

00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:05,790
is more genetically adapted to its

00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:07,140
challenges so I asked you how long it

00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,640
would be before people would land on

00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,980
Mars you probably thought it was crazy

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,920
that people might land within six years

00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:18,090
but what if I told you there will be

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,980
50,000 people on Mars by 2050 think back

00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:22,260
to when the first colonists arrived in

00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,150
the Americas from England the Mayflower

00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:27,330
was one ship with a hundred and two

00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:31,260
passengers thirty years later Boston was

00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:34,010
a city in 1621 ship sails to America

00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:39,240
from Britain 20 years later

00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:41,310
700 ships come in one summer SpaceX is

00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,260
actually already building its Mars

00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:47,700
rocket it's built the fuel tanks for

00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:49,590
three markets so far they've used to

00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,210
call this rock at the bfr and now they

00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:55,950
have a more subtle name for it

00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:57,480
starship it will have two stages the

00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:00,090
second stage which you see here is

00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,670
permanently attached to a spaceship this

00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:05,810
will be three times more powerful and

00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:10,980
far larger than any rocket ever built

00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:13,200
approximately 32 feet across the

00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,240
reusable first stage will return to

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,070
Earth after providing an initial boost

00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,110
and then the second stage that's built

00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:21,450
into the spaceship will get it up to

00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:23,040
earth orbit there it will dock with a

00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,590
tanker that tanker will have been

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,780
brought up by those reusable boosters it

00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:30,390
will refuel and then it will head to

00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:35,490
Mars and there will be 80 to 100 people

00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:38,160
aboard by 2030 SpaceX will probably have

00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:39,720
a few dozen of these rockets and we'll

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,750
be sending them to Mars every two years

00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:45,870
when the planets align just right but by

00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:47,940
2050 Elon Musk envisions that he will

00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:50,430
have built a thousand of these ships and

00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,680
that they will leave all at once every

00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:56,180
two years for

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,470
that's 80,000 people in a single trip so

00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,770
wobble all this mean

00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:02,420
it will mean that anyone with about

00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,190
$400,000 in his pocket who wants to

00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:08,600
start over can buy a one-way ticket from

00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:10,310
SpaceX and go to Mars but when humans do

00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,130
land on Mars for the first time and that

00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:15,320
may be five years from now it will be

00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:18,230
the most significant event in our

00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,190
history and I think it will be the most

00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:22,910
inspiring

00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:24,560
I'll let musk explain life can't just be

00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,230
about solving one miserable problem

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,410
after another they have to be reasons

00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:32,780
that like you wake up the morning you

00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:37,160
look forward to being alive you're

00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:40,790
excited about the future that's I think

00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,490
what Maj represents most to me it's

00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:46,230
seeing what the universe is all about

00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:48,940
[Music]

00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:51,790
now there's one additional question that

00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:54,340
I have which is where we go after Mars

00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:57,160
because Mars is not a permanent solution

00:39:54,340 --> 00:40:00,370
to the extinction of humans in the solar

00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:03,100
system and but at the current rate that

00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:05,380
our knowledge is accelerating I'll give

00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:08,560
you three ideas of things I think will

00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:11,080
happen by 2050 first I think we will

00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,760
discover life in our solar system maybe

00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:17,620
on Mars but probably not maybe on Europa

00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:21,280
once we do we will know that life in the

00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:23,200
universe is ubiquitous second we'll

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,600
discover another earth-like planet that

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,390
is not too distant to travel to even

00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,870
though it might be in another galaxy or

00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:34,990
in another star system say within a

00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:37,990
third of a human lifetime and finally

00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:40,180
will vastly improve our ability to

00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:43,210
travel efficiently both within and

00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:46,120
outside our solar system you're looking

00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:49,360
at a map by dr. Martin Lowe at the Jet

00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:52,180
Propulsion lab it shows gravitational

00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,400
freeways for spacecraft that exists in

00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:57,190
our solar system you can travel these

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,470
without any rocket fuel they these

00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:03,160
pathway these tunnels require virtually

00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:05,830
no energy to travel between planets so

00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:09,030
we will figure out how to become a

00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:13,249
spacefaring species thank you

00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:13,249
[Applause]

00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:23,800
you

00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:23,800
