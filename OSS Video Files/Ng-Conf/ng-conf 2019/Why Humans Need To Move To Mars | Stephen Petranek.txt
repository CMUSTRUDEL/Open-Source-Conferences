Title: Why Humans Need To Move To Mars | Stephen Petranek
Publication date: 2019-05-02
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	The talk will start by examining just 7 (of many) ways life on Earth as we know it could end suddenly–from an asteroid impact to our creation of new life forms in a lab that turn against us. Then we’ll explore how people will get to Mars, why that will happen with or without NASA’s cooperation, how we’ll live on Mars and build entirely new civilizations, and how we can eventually terraform the planet to make it more like Earth. The big surprise is how quickly all this will happen because space is about to become the biggest business on Earth, and how many people will end up there, including many of your children.
