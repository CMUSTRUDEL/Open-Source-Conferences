	In a snap Angular Elements provides Angular components as framework-independent web components.

But it is only later that the really interesting questions arise: What options are there for bundling Angular Elements and how does one deal with dependencies? Which polyfills do we need and when, and how can we lazy load Angular Elements on demand? How can ngIvy help us? What should be considered regarding zone.js and change tracking and how to use content projection?
