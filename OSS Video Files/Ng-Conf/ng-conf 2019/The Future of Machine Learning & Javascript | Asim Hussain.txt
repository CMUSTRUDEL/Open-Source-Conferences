Description: 
	There are many exciting things happening with AI, from which, until recently, JavaScript developers were largely shut out.

But things are changing, if you can do `npm install @tensorflow/tfjs` or make an API call, you can now do AI.

In this fast-paced talk, I’ll open your mind to what’s possible by demoing several AI-powered JavaScript apps and show you how they were built using either TensorFlow.js or easy to use AI powered APIs.

You don’t need a PhD in Maths, you don’t need years of experience, you just need imagination and the willingness to try.

ng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.
