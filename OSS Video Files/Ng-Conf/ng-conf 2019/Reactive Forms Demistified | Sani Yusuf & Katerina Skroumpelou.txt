Title: Reactive Forms Demistified | Sani Yusuf & Katerina Skroumpelou
Publication date: 2019-05-04
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	Reactive Forms are a mainstay in the Angular ecosystem yet a lot of developers limit their usage to just Login pages or traditional input collection. In this Worksop, we will showcase how you can take advantage of the full power of Reactive Forms to build some really powerful state-driven solutions. We will explore the hierarchy of Reactive Form Controls and showcase some smart ways to implement custom validation inside of your Angular application. The main aim of this talk is to enable users to be aware of what is at their disposal and how they can take advantage of the full power of Reactive Forms.

ng-conf is a three-day, single track Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe will be here all week at Salt Lake City, UT to participate in trainings by the Google Angular team and other Angular experts.

[Music]

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,220
right so you can see today the mini

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,029
workshop is reactive form demystified

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,980
and I think before we even begin to like

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,199
introduce ourselves and everything it

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,760
will probably be good if we set the

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,230
expectation of how we want the next two

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,300
hours to go so that it's gonna be a mix

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,739
we're gonna have a little bit of a talk

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,300
to give you some background about you

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,980
know some of the stuff both of us is

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,360
just gonna talk around but it's also

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,450
going to be very hands-on so we're gonna

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,879
have some some actual you know code are

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,920
we going to show you you know sort of

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,170
introduce you to but its hands on in the

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,610
case where we've decided that would also

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,170
give you like mini tasks where we

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,660
actually get to work around and actually

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,300
help you and we even have ways where if

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,579
you eventually like solve a problem we

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,039
can actually how I have a link and we

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,690
can share your screen on there and you

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,640
can show it and just educate people on

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,350
how you arrive with specific stuff the

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,090
same way if you also have a mini problem

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,950
on anything we've talked about you can

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,630
put it up on the screen and we also like

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,200
clear program together and solve it

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,310
together so it's not okay with everybody

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,159
all right okay

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,439
so thank you very much I think we're

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,070
gonna start off with our self sunny and

I'm a Google developer expert for

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,439
angular and web technologies I work for

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:37,890
this dog labs I'm a software engineer

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,530
and I work mostly in angular projects I

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,790
also run the angular Athens community in

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,899
Athens I'm from Greece on base there and

00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,180

always on the move by the way and yeah

00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:58,770
alright and alright a little bit about

00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,969
myself I can already see some I'm not

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,680
going to spend time because I can see

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:05,100
some faces for my last stop which is in

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,270
this room and well yeah similar to

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,869
Katrina I'm also a Google developer

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,729
expert

00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:12,220
on angular I'm actually Nigerian

00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:15,940
originally but I live in London now in

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,910
the UK and I'm a big big big Avatar fan

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,160
like for me that's if we're gonna get

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,220
along dot dots and moss that's a

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,940
deal-breaker for me and you can follow

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:30,670
me as well a line you the same thing

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,930
sound use of everywhere right and I'm

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,330
gonna talk a little bit about Cartesian

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,010
to myself and like Katrina so this

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,200
workshop was actually Katrina's idea and

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,620
we've always wanted to do something

00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,840
together because it's like it's crazy we

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,940
can get a hang around a lot yeah it's

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,959
like like we're almost like family we

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:51,819
get to hang around in a lot of these

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,780
conferences and so for this body so for

00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:54,910
the first time you were like you know

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,250
why she's just like you know why don't

00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:00,730
we actually do something together and

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,410
I'm you're like I like the idea we had a

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,390
bunch of ideas but we I think we settled

00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,459
in this idea so Katrina came up with a

00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,959
lot of ideas so we we submitted there so

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:10,660
we were really really excited that we

00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,730
both got accepted to come and to to give

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,260
this so yeah that's pretty pretty like

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,910
this is so if we freaked out a little

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,079
bit this is new to us we've known each

00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,980
other for a while but this is the first

00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:26,200
time we're actually doing something

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:27,640
together right yes so this is the part

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,130
of the talk where we're going to talk a

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,940
little bit about the background and

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:37,359
about a bit about forms and where we we

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,769
talk and before we get into the code so

00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:41,859
let's talk a little bit about forms

00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:45,190
everyone here is is you know here for

00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:46,720
the reactive form saw has it like what's

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,880
the split in the room are we do we have

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,280
like advanced reactive forms people I

00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,750
use reactive forms every day or hey you

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,010
know I haven't really used it oh I've

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,930
started but I'm not sure if what I'm

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,260
doing so hands up if you've never used

00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:01,510
reactive forms okay it's good amount of

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,359
people hands up if you work with forms

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:08,350
right but you're not using reactive

00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:09,459
forms currently okay hands up if you use

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,650
reactive forms every day but you're not

00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:14,139
quite sure if you know it's like am i

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:17,049
doing it right or that kind of thing and

00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:19,830
if you're like outright Jedi mode you

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,830
know hands up

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:28,240
okay well that means we're all here

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:29,980
together cuz so the thing we forms is

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,960
forms are really you know we use them in

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,610
day to day in our lives and this is

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,190
something Katrina I always talk about

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,870
like you know what part of well just

00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,670
even yesterday where we sat down and we

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,980
were going through the slides like you

00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,840
know you use them everyday like if you

00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:50,950
think you have not used a form today let

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:52,480
me see your hands out so you literally

00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,340
use them every day but the thing with

00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,440
forms is when they don't work that's

00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:59,530
when you remember that they are forms

00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,420
but when they do work it's just an

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,700
extension of your your own human ability

00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,080
so if you think about like your car and

00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,710
when you go into your car and you're

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,790
typing the GPS that's actually a form

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,700
but you never really think about it

00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,680
because it works you know technically

00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,910
you could argue that even when you get

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,320
into the elevator and you're clicking

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,870
those buttons that's actually a form

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,440
because you're given if you feedback you

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,990
know so let's see some forms that you

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,290
use so you everybody knows this one

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,030
right Twitter right and and if you've

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:34,630
been on my Twitter for the last week you

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:37,590
probably I think there might be some

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:41,230
people that no one has gone on but yeah

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:46,150
but we all know Twitter right so this

00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:48,880
box here is really what it's all about

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,040
if there's there is in this box the

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,210
entire business goes to to waste there's

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:59,290
there's no there's no Twitter right so

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,580
this is essential for Twitter if you

00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,130
take away the farm there's no business

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,470
there's no billion-dollar business and

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:12,400
[Music]

00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:14,950
Karina you love this one right so again

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,720
this is a single point of inputs that

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,270
you get when you get on Google if that

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,810
forum doesn't work then you have a

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,850
problem yeah in my opinion I think this

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,040
is the most expensive or expensive forum

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,960
in the world exactly it's a six hundred

00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,010
billion dollar forum and it's probably

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,690
the first forum we have

00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,460
yeah like one of you got used to but

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,170
it's like we've even created a now and

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:40,740
out after a like Google this Google me

00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:41,430
Google about okay it's a four it isn't

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,370
that crazy

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,170
but because it works we just look at it

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,420
as an extension of our ability like I

00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,980
you know I googled it but what does it

00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,150
actually mean to Google I felt it

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,060
information and it gave me information

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,500
back and if Google is probably the one

00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,940
form that probably has a really good

00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,510
experience you know you get what you

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:05,190
want you go there and you see it right

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:08,360
so this one I think everybody has used

00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:12,930
this one right but it's actually a form

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,400
and this is the one that we forget that

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,500
it's not a phone who do you what what do

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,570
you guys think I'm you all think sorry

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,770
apologies for using the wrong way what

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:24,450
you all think I we are put in there

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:30,360
anybody think alike have an idea of what

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:35,600
we're trying to display there a URL bar

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:38,160
yes that's a for you use it all the time

00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,710
well you don't really realize because it

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,150
just works you know you put in you know

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,970
you're going incognito you put in the

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:49,050
website you wanna and you know and it

00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:50,600
works right yeah and this is the one I

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,700
actually don't have you Caterina right

00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:58,260
we need to fix that yeah are we on there

00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,850
yet how we connected on there yet we'll

00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,460
fix it yeah

00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:05,850
Facebook right if you want to spy on

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:12,479
people you know do crazy things single

00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:13,950
actions and it all starts with a form so

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,729
you can see how powerful forms can be

00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:19,260
then right too many options yes and even

00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:22,229
the you know the colors and everything

00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:25,680
those are really you know they're good

00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:27,840
farm options or cuz it's just right and

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,229
pops up another form dishes a color or

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,020
an emoji or something absolutely so

00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:35,789
that's great

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,050
so I think this is one thing we need to

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,360
talk about which is they have the

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:43,680
ability to make or break your business

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:45,410
right like imagine if Google search was

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,259
not

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:51,240
right imagine it wasn't quick imagine

00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:52,560
how to wait 2 seconds to 2 I for the

00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,540
Google searches show up would you be

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,329
using Google like DuckDuckGo would have

00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:01,259
a great day right

00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:03,899
well Bing will finally be relevant you

00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:04,589
know the funny thing about being be make

00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,339
a profit

00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:11,129
really yes but guess what the most

00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:17,250
googled about most searched word on Bing

00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:19,350
is said I get yes

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,610
it's Google Google's one of the top

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:25,439
three sites code and also I think it's

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:27,209
download Chrome which which is crazy

00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,529
because most people not know what they

00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,970
do which is go on a macro submission

00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:32,399
like you know the first thing it is what

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,660
you download Chrome but they turning a

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,459
profit they've been turning a profit

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:41,699
since I think 2012 five billion dollars

00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:44,550
to be specific so they turn the profit

00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:46,500
like the amount of profit he turned is

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,029
almost like what some companies are

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,459
worth yeah and I was shocked to find

00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:52,649
that out because you know my grandma my

00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,029
granddad don't know about Google they

00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:57,120
just want to search see them they

00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:58,800
actually using Google but I said they

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,420
don't change that and then the Apple

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,480
iPhone as well because it used to be the

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,759
default search engine until Google

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,730
decided to send up or like I think a 10

00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:11,880
million dollar check every year to like

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:13,230
Google the default one yeah but yeah

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,000
they do have the ability to make or

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:18,300
break your business why do you think

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,680
nobody likes using doing their taxes if

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,889
you like doing your taxes let me see

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,439
your hands up good we don't have any

00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:27,509
serial killers in the room yeah perfect

00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:32,519
right well why do you think nobody like

00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:36,569
these taxes because it sucks all right

00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:38,009
it really does suck that's the thing so

00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,240
I think one way would start is we will

00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:41,610
start by seeing some really really

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,160
terrible forms like absolutely terrible

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,500
forms right and and every picture we

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,389
show there's a stack let's link so when

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,329
we do here Katerina's going to tweet the

00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:53,009
the slides at the end and so you can

00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:54,899
follow her there and then it has the

00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:57,060
link to all the cycle so you have a the

00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,710
material available to you right

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:02,980
[Music]

00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:05,830
so this is the first one do you know

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:10,380
what this is signifying what is it

00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:13,570
anybody this is interactive exactly

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,670
those websites where you just land you

00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,420
haven't done anything but they already

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:21,160
tell me or do something wrong like it's

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,870
it's a bit freaky cuz like I want to

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,880
give you my information you do realize

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,440
that right well you're telling me I'm

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,590
doing something wrong so the validation

00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:33,010
is already starting way before the users

00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:35,770
interacted with the forum and believe it

00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:38,080
or not this is very very common this is

00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,690
a really really common so you can see

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,970
like it and one thing that forms

00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,490
actually because there's a lot of red

00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,820
going around and we normally use forms

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,900
like a lot of times women use forms it's

00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,400
really it relates to like three

00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,010
transactions with money and all of that

00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,480
so we take your personal human beads so

00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,950
if you have you ever had this thing

00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,410
where you want to buy something online

00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,480
and you go to the website but it's not

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,370
mobile-optimized yeah and that's at the

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,810
point you just like yeah you either wait

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,210
till you go home or if there's an

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,770
alternative you just use it because why

00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,880
would I spend my money and have a bad

00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,930
experience I'm trying to give you my

00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:17,530
money I should have a good experience

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:20,080
right and it's scary yeah I agree

00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,610
so this is the first one let me make my

00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,680
damn mistake first like you know at

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,300
least give me the opportunity to try to

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,160
give you my information which you want

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,250
before you tell me I'm doing something

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:35,290
wrong right okay so let's see the second

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:39,660
one this is one that you know who can

00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,660
spot what is wrong here potentially

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,829
exactly the submit button is enabled

00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:48,679
which means the user can actually like

00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:49,910
you're not helping the user fill this

00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:52,970
form because you're telling them

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,999
everything is okay when it's not right

00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:01,220
so it's very important that you're clear

00:12:54,999 --> 00:13:02,540
about the information that you want you

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,459
know there are some exceptions of course

00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,850
when you have like a call to action you

00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:09,889
know that you cannot disable a call to

00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:13,939
action because it's how you you know get

00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:15,709
users and stuff like that so you do a

00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:21,980
different type of validation but yeah

00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:28,269
for most forms like this what about this

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:28,269
one oh yes

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:44,570
we can guess what's wrong here okay this

00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:47,120
is a yeah perfect yes so here I'm

00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,260
filling my last name first but it's

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,940
already telling me that oh I haven't

00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:53,540
entered my email I'm like yeah I know I

00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:55,490
already have two hands right like

00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,130
there's only much I can do there's only

00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:00,790
one cursor on the screen so give me time

00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:03,950
you know to like focus on what I'm doing

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:05,660
wrong you know it's okay it doesn't

00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,950
matter if I give you my last name first

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,070
then my using it first you want my

00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:16,130
information right so give me help me

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:17,750
fill the form right and it's important

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,130
to like you know when a user has

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,050
actually interacted with the field so

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:22,760
that you would know which field it is

00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:28,520
because that's the only way you can okay

00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:30,200
this is where they are right okay yeah

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,110
so the only time like there can be an

00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,490
exception to this is order and can

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,790
anybody think of any use case where you

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,260
need to like or you need their users to

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,270
feel a specific order

00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,100
can you think of anything you know any

00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:45,700
like when order I can't think of any of

00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,700
the top of my head

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:59,019
yeah exactly you know or maybe you're

00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,399
ordering something and you want a bunch

00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:01,870
of information but maybe it's better if

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,339
you tell me what you listed I can

00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,370
actually see if I actually deliver to

00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:08,410
you before we go on because what would

00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,209
really be like I'll be angry if you

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,459
collect all my information all right at

00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,879
the end I'm like oh by the way we don't

00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:16,750
actually deliver to you you know sorry

00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:20,230
maybe that's something you should have

00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:24,000
done first right so that's when and it

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:30,069
can be an exception to the rule right oh

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:35,949
this one this one does anybody know this

00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:37,930
one what is this one exactly

00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:40,180
too much information there they want to

00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,829
know your dog's details your personal

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,800
details you'll catch details is like you

00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:46,449
know one at the time it's like because

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,019
what this does it freaks people out if

00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:53,500
it doesn't build trust it's like wow why

00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:55,689
don't you need to know about my dog you

00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:01,259
know it's like it's a long list of

00:15:55,689 --> 00:16:01,259
information and this is how taxes feel

00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:07,720
what I heard in Estonia it's actually

00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:12,009
one of the countries in the world where

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:14,379
it's so easy to do taxes No yeah they

00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:16,149
even have like this IRA's NC thing where

00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:17,860
you can become like a virtual citizen of

00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:19,000
the country there's like a lot of people

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,050
live in the country they have a lot of

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,629
smart people but it's just not enough

00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,980
industry so a lot of people leave in so

00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:26,620
you can set up a business and like like

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,259
this and you get a card and even if like

00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,639
like someone in like the government

00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:32,259
wants access to information you get

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,970
approval that they can access not

00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,860
information or not so the police need to

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:40,899
do a background check on you you'd have

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:49,449
to say yes or no it's very that's a bit

00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:53,129
too cold for me yeah this one you know

00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:53,129
and then this happens

00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:59,350
classic right yeah like maybe you should

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:02,050
have just checked if the username was

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:03,610
available first before let's see me

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,199
actually submit what the worst part is

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,679
when it does come

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,839
back all that information I feel he's

00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:12,069
gone and imagine if it was a long form

00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,769
as well yeah

00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:17,230
oh I always give up yeah like that's the

00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:19,569
point we're just like yeah you're not

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,689
getting my money today no nope

00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:26,860
yeah I'm not gonna do this I think you

00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:28,720
what this once happened to me with we

00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:33,010
know when online grocery shopping was

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,710
very new and I spent hours tomatoes you

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,210
know everything and all of that and then

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,950
he turned out by the date I one of the

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,779
groceries delivered was not available

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,600
and then I had to like do the whole

00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:46,710
thing just went south because I was

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:50,340
checking out as I guess I just Hoover I

00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:53,350

thing is not for me you just went to the

00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:58,299
grocery store because it's like I spent

00:17:56,529 --> 00:18:00,220
all that time I leave you go angry like

00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:04,149
hey picked up my bag and like yeah we're

00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:05,620
gonna to go Street so in person okay so

00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,510
I guess we're we here Katarina and I is

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,860
to show you the question is how can we

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,269
get in create better forms in angular

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,769
like how can you actually do that right

00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:13,990
so that's the whole point

00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:15,940
okay but this is what we talked about

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,549
reactive forms right

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,769
I know Catalina you like maths a lot

00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:22,179
like you are like if you want to know

00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:23,919
anything about Maps like how to unit is

00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:25,630
like a map genius like like she's got

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,100
like longitude of latitude you can

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,409
probably tell you the long view louder

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:33,669
you're right now you put a lot like

00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:35,500
internal GPS but I know you really

00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:37,510
really love forms as well because this

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,190
is you know I remember when you pitch

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,710
the idea and it's like a thank you sure

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:44,470
should not do this you do that but here

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,630
we are so you know yeah CDs behind it so

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,429
these are some of the features you know

00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,429
our phones allow you to do and I think

00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:53,230
the one I really like is is is like the

00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:55,510
observation part where you're able to

00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:59,370
like observe what the users doing you

00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,370
know very active phones allow you to do

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,130
yes yes I said before to know if a user

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,789
has touched the field in order to show

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:12,220
or not narrow mm-hmm yes valid

00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:14,919
absolutely I agree and and what that

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,559
does is actually I think it it makes the

00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:19,390
experience very empathetic yeah right

00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:23,650
because it feels like you

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:25,840
like it feels like you actually care can

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:27,820
anybody think of like any thing they use

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,340
that maybe has a really really good form

00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,520
experience nice very empathetic can you

00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,290
think of any stripe

00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,260
actually yeah stripe is not bad yeah

00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:40,000
trap is is not that I think off zero off

00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,230
zero as well if you use our zero for

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,809
authentication there the overall

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:48,880
experience is pretty good is is really

00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:53,530
really nice any any any anyone like hey

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:56,830
this is a form I really like using okay

00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:58,330
I think composability as well as another

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,370
thing because we all have like these

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,830
crazy use cases you know we need to

00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:05,440
create a form that does XYZ not can go

00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:07,900
to the moon that can is green that is

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,120
vegan you know like a lot of things know

00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,790
that allows us to you know that

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,490
composability i think the fact that if

00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,929
you have this very very interesting case

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,419
you can do that you know one thing I

00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:20,679
learned teaching one time a class that

00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:24,309
they are actually three states of a

00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:26,290
checks map checkbox because we always

00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:27,160
assume that's too right yeah check or

00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,140
and check but there's actually a

00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,419
Thursday I don't know if I check out of

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:35,020
a radio the inter deterministic

00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:37,120
basically not checked or checked which

00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,520
is interesting apparently there was one

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,919
guy but his company really needed that

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,600
because when you check something happen

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,370
so there's this middle state but it's

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,960
actually part of the w3c standard I

00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,240
believe is either checkbox or radio but

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,000
it has actually three states so you know

00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,040
composability and I think extendibility

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,960
which just relates the composability as

00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,540
well you can extend multiple features

00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,010
and do a lot of stuff right yeah okay

00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,690
any questions so far by the way guys

00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:07,330
it's very open all right keep saying

00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:09,510
network people so please any questions

00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,510
so far

00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:22,570
no pre no be good what is the square

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:25,960
root of x not one question has anybody

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:28,000
still found X because last time I had a

00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,440
nephew and I went to saw their homework

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,640
and they still looking for it I mean

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,900
looking for this is my

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,370
I was your age we never found it all

00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:42,070
right so let's talk about the building

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:43,660
blocks right so this is this is

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,480
basically the building blocks of reactor

00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:49,299
forms right at the core of it everything

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,500
is an abstract control right that's like

00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:53,470
the core of it so everything is an

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:56,590
abstract control and then you have three

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,610
members all right from control from

00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,420
Group four for Murray which one's your

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:03,640
favorite which one do you like using

00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:07,179
yeah because it makes things tidy you

00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,340
can group things and crossbody date and

00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:11,890
cross-check yeah yeah I think it's the

00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,830
best feature yeah I would agree with you

00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:17,350
I agree with you I didn't have this

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:19,840
thing where I don't know I might say

00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,880
actually I I think form group is the

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,650
best feature and I like it but in close

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,720
second I'll actually say is the abstract

00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,860
control itself which is interesting

00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,140
because you can't really it's it's just

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,700
it's just an abstract like the base but

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,980
because sometimes you have these complex

00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,929
forms and you know you cannot write like

00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,059
be sure without extending like oh I

00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:38,710
wanted to only be form groups or form

00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:40,360
arrays or form controls when you are a

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:44,710
country just like it's a lazy of just

00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,090
saying you know everything so yeah so

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,530
everything is an abstract control so

00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,690
there's a lot of stuff in the abstract

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,820
control level and then the form control

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,710
inherits from that and how extends its

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,179
own stuff the form group that's the same

00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,410
and the former II doesn't seem and we're

00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:59,770
going to talk about each and every one

00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,880
of them independently right so like I

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,280
said if there's any question on any

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,870
point in time please feel free to hit us

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,190
up this is all going to be interactive I

00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,360
see a lot of you your laptop's that's

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,770
pretty good because we're gonna have a

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,120
lot of interactive sessions you know

00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:12,160
we're gonna be going around and making

00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,179
sure everyone is good like it's free

00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,890
training you're not gonna get anywhere

00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:20,380
trust me yeah so of course to start

00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,710
working with reactive forms what do you

00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,169
do

00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:25,510
you import the module that's the thing

00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:28,120
that's the most important thing do you

00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:30,100
still remember when like because you

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,660
know now with the CLI when you created

00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,780
component it automatically declares the

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,799
component in the module for you but do

00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,360
you remember the time when that wasn't a

00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:39,030
thing and you spend hours while your

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,120
code wasn't working because you forgot

00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,220
to declare

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,250
yeah we've come a long way with the CLI

00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:50,990
I mean if you worked angularjs there was

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:53,150
no CLI right yeah I actually never we're

00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,610
parked my angularjs project me neither

00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,320
yeah cuz I just like I had like so much

00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,690
PTSD from just working with the damn

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:06,110
thing that's just to send it to this to

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:08,840
production like that like yeah we're

00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:11,750
better now we're good thanks to you

00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,720
unlock it alright so yeah reactive forms

00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:17,300
module it you come to the from the

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,810
angular four slash forms package so you

00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:24,050
import that right so let's talk about

00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:25,550
the form control first right so this is

00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:29,090
what the form control tends to look like

00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:31,970
you know yeah when you need like a one

00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:34,400
individual control like a simple

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,180
individual input or text box that's

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,280
something like that that doesn't

00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,740
necessarily relate to another thing this

00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,690
is where you use the form control so if

00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,160
you're a building like Google but the

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,020
search box that would be one form

00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,650
control right because you just want to

00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:50,030
be there and and you can see like

00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,770
there's a directive property they're

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,120
called form control that you can bind to

00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,100
which may is made available by the

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,390
reactive forms module and then you can

00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,240
provide the instance of your from

00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:02,050
control and you can just instantiate

00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:06,700
that right

00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:09,710
you know okay we'll talk about it later

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,810
yeah so it works by the form control

00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:13,250
property right you just you know buy

00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:19,940
into that property and you have it all

00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:23,090
good okay and yeah so we have the

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:26,930
Caterina's favorite yeah okay even it is

00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:28,460
the honors for this one yeah so it you

00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:37,520
know it's just mainly with the form

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:39,980
element and it's you aggregate and group

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,230
controls so if you want to group to feel

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,540
sick for example to validate them

00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:49,670
together or you want to make your form

00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:52,070
or tidy up and like in in groups that

00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,460
have the same theme for example or the

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,980
same

00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,960
it's it's good to use it and also

00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:00,499
provides an object based API for

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,179
accessing group controls yeah what would

00:26:00,499 --> 00:26:04,190
you say for you is your favorite thing

00:26:02,179 --> 00:26:08,149
about like form group like why why form

00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:11,889
group all the time and I think it's

00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:15,320
really it also helped me to debug yeah

00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:18,559
yeah because it's it sort of breaks down

00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,570
the forming sort of smaller blocks so if

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,279
you have a mistake you can find it

00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:25,549
easier I think that's the main thing for

00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:28,220
me yeah that's actually pretty good and

00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:30,769
this is what a typical form group would

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,320
look like all right

00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:35,210
you'd have you know so I think one of

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,519
the things I like and this is very

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:38,899
controversial but the fact that you know

00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:40,789
you just put the phone like as soon as

00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:42,529
you you associate the form or the form

00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:43,580
group then everything else in the thing

00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:46,850
you just use form control name to

00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:49,249
associate them right so on the right

00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:51,080
hand side you can see the the actual

00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:53,450
code and left hand side you can see how

00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,559
they associate so you put a name first

00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,789
name and are you associated with

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,379
anything called first name so now you

00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:58,820
have like a one-to-one mapping for all

00:26:57,379 --> 00:27:06,070
of them if that makes sense

00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:08,029
right clear so far any questions okay

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:11,179
you can also specialist guys we don't

00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:14,749
bite maybe just a little bit but are you

00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:17,559
not paying attention this is what my

00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:17,559
teacher is the same

00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:49,130
okay so I think I we will talk about

00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,990
that a little bit we wouldn't

00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,060
practically get because it gets be only

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,260
advanced the scope of this that's where

00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,330
you needed something called the control

00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,980
value access a property to make the

00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,660
connections because now you're creating

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,880
like a UX you're extending the forms

00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:03,800
itself right and so there are a lot of

00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:08,510
ways and actually there are some you

00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:10,310
know Bram Bram has this a formally I

00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,050
think it's called which actually makes

00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,340
that process way easier for so you don't

00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,630
have to do that groundwork so we talk

00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,550
about that at the end but it's a

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,020
framework that someone created where you

00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:20,090
just literally give it the configuration

00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:23,740
and the component any old automatically

00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:26,930
does all of that for you yeah all right

00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:29,270
Susan was here he likes that he had a

00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:30,470
talk an entire talk about like literally

00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,570
all the troubles he went through with

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:35,090
the whole custom stuff yeah I used to

00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:39,710
not be easy alright so we're gonna talk

00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:42,560
about full memory next right so form

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,160
array is like the it's like the middle

00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,100
child

00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,810
you know the Forgotten one like for the

00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:52,670
most part don't worry I'm a middle child

00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:54,350
too so you'll be fine don't worry but

00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,690
it's like just tag the form group but it

00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,460
just gives you an array like syntax and

00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,450
sometimes you need an array like since I

00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,000
especially if you're working with like

00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:04,970
numbered stuff it really really does

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,760
make sense paged stuff I still find

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,500
myself using foam group even if I have

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:18,860
like a area like for some reason I don't

00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:20,480
know why you use from yeah yeah but it's

00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,150
it's very similar but it's just in a

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,530
real accent acts but a lot of times I'll

00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:26,510
be very honest with you it has a

00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:28,250
specific use case but I don't know if

00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:30,230
it's a code smell but I think we all do

00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,910
we tend to just use form group a lot a

00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,500
lot more because I think people just

00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:37,309
like the object lacks in

00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,750
a lot maybe someone will use it today

00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,700
and show us yeah it's one of our

00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:43,100
challenge activities actually so

00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,169
hopefully yeah and I'm giving a Tesla

00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,460
for that I just said tell us so you

00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:50,299
might just be a picture of a Tesla you

00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:52,280
never know he might not be the car

00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:56,419
itself yeah

00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:58,870
all right so which every example we've

00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:02,390
shown has always been like declarative

00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:04,520
sorry imperative you know instantiated

00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:08,120
equals but it's also like a declarative

00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:12,650
way of doing this this thing oh we've

00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:15,530
actually got the wrong oh my bad I'll

00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:17,900
show it but there's a more imperative

00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:19,250
way with the form builder where you can

00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,470
actually you know what I found out

00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:26,960
recently the form builder hatch actually

00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:28,940
has a a function call you know I group

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,980
yeah it has the array but it also has

00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,960
dot control so he can actually create a

00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:36,730
form control over the formula which is

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,039
weird yeah yeah so it's it's pretty cool

00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,630
so demo time

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,309
yeah I totally got my ass kicked don't

00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:46,280
worry totally

00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:48,710
ing buy things right yeah I look at my

00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,110
defense look at his defense you could

00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,760
tell I've never held it here before we

00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:55,130
should see a Katrina you Greek so you

00:30:52,760 --> 00:31:03,220
probably have like you know Spartan you

00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:07,070
know Katerina is that stress be like

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:09,559
like don't go run a 5k with her I try

00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:13,100
didn't end up well it did not end up

00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:14,570
well so we're going to talk about how he

00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,270
changes how you can actually monitor

00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:19,370
change change of values we talked about

00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,900
the building validation stuff we talked

00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:23,530
about like how you can actually compose

00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:26,240
a lot of like you know complex forms and

00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:27,620
also we can talk about custom validation

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,080
so how you create your own custom

00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:33,320
validation right and then we will also

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,980
talk about async validation custom async

00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:41,799
validation which is asynchronous right

00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:45,980
okay so are you ready are we ready are

00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:47,270
we ready are we are we doesn't seem like

00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:51,890
we ready Corina let's go

00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:54,170
for lunch they're not ready all right so

00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:57,980
the way this session is gonna be going

00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:59,360
along is we would so Kathleen are just

00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,200
going to be pair programming we'll show

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,700
you the the like we'll talk like we'll

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,830
start with a form control so we actually

00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,900
show you elements and things about that

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,430
with documentation of stuff so welcome

00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,650
for questions and then we'll show you a

00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:14,210
demo that we've we've built on the side

00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:17,450
what we do with that demo is then we

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,950
challenge you to create that demo right

00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:20,300
and then we give you some time where we

00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,910
go around we see what people are doing

00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:25,640
then at the end we show you our solution

00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:27,950
for that particular demo so that you can

00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,230
see if you cannot add up so a lot a lot

00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,670
of you are actually going to do way

00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,960
better than us and the demo doesn't you

00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,400
don't have to use bootstrap or anything

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,830
just literally it's all about

00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:40,640
functionality so it's a case of we show

00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:43,280
a little bit we basically we show you

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,590
the actual functionality and we welcome

00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,450
you to also you know you don't have sit

00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,610
on your seat you don't it's a great time

00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,530
to actually meet the next person Hey hi

00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,500
my name is sunny I'm not a very nice

00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:57,740
person you know I kind of think like

00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,760
just meet people and talk to them and so

00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,740
it's not a thing where we judge

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,210
individuals but you can come together on

00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,130
one person's machine to see what people

00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:06,500
are doing and at the end and in the end

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:09,200
will you even welcome you we have a link

00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,400
I haven't appeared at i-n room which you

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,260
can actually share then we share the

00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,160
screen or live on stage which is pretty

00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,810
good so you can be part of the

00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,210
conference and you can show this is what

00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:19,100
we do so feel free to group feel free to

00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,810
do individual stuff and we're always

00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,030
also going to be walking around so you

00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:25,790
can get our attention to say hey you

00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:27,650
know Katarina I hope this or sunny help

00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:33,650
you with that I probably don't know a

00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:42,170
lot of it like right so please I just

00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:44,840
know how to talk okay how's that for a

00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:47,480
plan cool stuff okay let's just be

00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:51,170
mindful of her time yeah okay so we have

00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,790
around we'd spend 40 minutes oh good

00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:57,620
good good where we were right bang and

00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:58,910
tie okay see African Prince you know

00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,210
he's been sending his emails all your

00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:07,870
life you never knew he was real did you

00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:15,550
so next time send your money alright

00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:20,510
let's do this actually wait hold on I

00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:21,620
think I have a mirror display here so I

00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:24,890
can end the show

00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,960
I think I'm mirrored at this way by the

00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:29,810
way if you see anything interesting on

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,500
my screen or like my browser history I

00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:37,900
apologize in advance all right all right

00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:45,500
yes I really do apologize in advance is

00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:48,170
this pretty good pretty good okay so

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:53,450
what we're gonna do is we are going to

00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:54,830
go to like stackless stop wait so come

00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:56,960
and we welcome you to use tackle it's

00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:59,840
why because it's very easy to share and

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,570
all the data right oh it's changed oh

00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,070
yeah they did launch an update so I'm

00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:09,200
just gonna go ahead and create like a

00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:10,370
new what's it called project so at this

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,350
point in time you don't actually have to

00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:15,050
follow cuz this is more the it's just

00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:17,060
not mandatory you follow right but you

00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:18,620
feel free to go it's just more we're

00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,120
going to show you one or two things so

00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,130
we start off with a phone control I

00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,740
really show you some stuff and then from

00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:26,950
there on we go on right okay so let's

00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:31,030
just create a brand new angular project

00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:33,530
I'm just gonna make this a bit larger oh

00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:40,940
is it okay if we change the resolution

00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:45,500
as well okay okay let me let me give it

00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:47,060
a go display let's see if we can change

00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,340
the resolutions that I it's good for

00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,070
them and for us I think I'm supposed to

00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:54,530
go

00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:57,320
scaled and then I go down to 720p which

00:35:54,530 --> 00:36:00,500
would make everything huge and good for

00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:03,680
us how is that much better everybody

00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,000
okay with that right can anybody not see

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,590
especially for the guy people in the

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,670
back yeah especially for the people in

00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:14,060
the back

00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:16,280
cannot see okay we all have to go as a

00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:18,020
we're not leaving anybody behind so if

00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,700
one person can not see I'm happy to make

00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,920
it bigger right okay

00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,950
so let's just open this in a new window

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,540
right so the first thing who can tell me

00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:30,010
what's the first thing we would do when

00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,010
we want to work with reactive forms

00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:35,890
exactly Gary we import the module

00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,370
someone wants to win by Tesla yeah

00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:41,240
exactly

00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:45,770
okay so we're gonna go to here and just

00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:51,320
say reactive forms like oh there's

00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:53,480
autocomplete now once that lit yeah I'm

00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,370
just so used to whip star cuz like yeah

00:36:53,480 --> 00:37:01,240
yeah I'm one of those people I'm a new

00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:04,070
app summer yeah I used to like here I

00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:06,470
don't know sometimes the lender it gets

00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:09,080
on my nerves and webstorm the one the

00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:11,090
linter really oh yeah that is annoying I

00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:14,180
there's like no simple way to turn it

00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:15,740
off right yeah yeah all right so we do

00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,970
that and then the next thing we'll make

00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:22,340
sure that we import it so reactive forms

00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:24,770
module right now we're good to go right

00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,090
so we're going to go to the HTML and the

00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:28,880
first thing we will do is let's just add

00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:34,420
like a simple you know let's do like a

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:37,520
h1 tag and be like you know yeah sue

00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:41,270
it's a great way of saying hi yeah any

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:44,750
Greeks here no okay oh there's one

00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:53,420
really where is half Greek 50% account

00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:55,610
you know yes so he doesn't know yes does

00:37:53,420 --> 00:38:00,710
that mean I'm more Greek than he is yeah

00:37:55,610 --> 00:38:05,710
oh look at me the African Greek alright

00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:09,140
alright so we're gonna just have like a

00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:13,610
standard input here and let's give it a

00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:15,800
type and will probably say maybe type

00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:18,500
text just you know I think that's the

00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,920
default anyway right and let's go to the

00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:24,740
preview so we have this right standard

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,680
stuff right pretty okay

00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:29,630
the world's most beautiful application

00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:33,680
if I lived in San Francisco pretty much

00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:36,380
raised a Series A with this trust me all

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,290
right by the way is it visible

00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,880
everybody could anybody see all bigger

00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:46,339
let's make it a bit bigger a little bit

00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,780
bigger better or even bigger I got okay

00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:51,650
okay should be fine

00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:53,480
oh no don't save Sonny okay so now we

00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:54,920
want to work with a simple form control

00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,750
right like this let's just pretend we

00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,119
were building Google or something like

00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,640
that right and the first thing we would

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,040
do is we would go to this hello

00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,710
components and then we will actually

00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:10,190
create a property that will be the phone

00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:12,619
control right so here I will just I

00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:17,030
think we can just yeah we don't need

00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:22,910
that so I'm just going to call it let's

00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:27,020
say my form control I'm tempted to use

00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:31,700
foo and bar but yeah and I'm just gonna

00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:38,030
make it off time of type form control

00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:41,079
right yeah see why I like webstorm and

00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:49,190
so now I have to like go and import this

00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:59,000
with yeah from angular four slash forms

00:39:49,190 --> 00:40:01,369
correct yep that's it so we create the

00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,089
property here right and I think we just

00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:06,770
do a constructor and inside of the

00:40:05,089 --> 00:40:09,680
constructor we can just instantiate this

00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:12,980
particular form that was the code so

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:19,609
we'll be like this but my phone control

00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:24,559
equals new form control right so this is

00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:26,450
the and so now the next question is what

00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:28,819
entails like what is the front phone

00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:30,799
contra entails how can until how can we

00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:32,299
you know customize it what kind of

00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:34,609
properties can we give the form control

00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:36,109
right so let's actually go to the

00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:37,520
documentation and we try and make this

00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:38,510
as honest as possible because this is

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,390
the same way you

00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:46,250
would you know trying to so let's

00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:48,350
actually go to the angular that IO again

00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:53,780
I apologize for any autocomplete you

00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:58,520
know yeah no no it's so good so we can

00:40:53,780 --> 00:41:00,140
go to let's say should we let stop with

00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:05,420
the abstract first yeah to have a look

00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:08,180
at the abstract yeah yeah yeah after I

00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,010
control right so the one great thing is

00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:12,250
I like with the angular IO upside it's

00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:14,690
it's almost self documented yeah yeah

00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,700
and I like the examples they gave as

00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:18,050
well right okay so let's look at the

00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,210
base class you remember what I talked

00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:22,010
about everything in the form it's it's a

00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:24,050
it's an abstract control right so let's

00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:26,600
look at that abstract control so if you

00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:28,970
look at the abstract control you can see

00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,860
a bunch of things there you know status

00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:36,620
invalid valid and we're gonna talk about

00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:39,290
those but let's actually go to the open

00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:44,300
another one and say angular that IO and

00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:46,280
then oh the wrong conference I know that

00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,300
IO and then we'll look at the form

00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:53,150
control itself right so if we look at

00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:55,280
that so now let's have a look at the

00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:58,160
constructor there so the constructor

00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,780
says you can pass in the first like

00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,990
parameter that you pass is the initial

00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:05,750
state right of the form which means

00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:07,550
what's the initial value because every

00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,980
input element has a what a value

00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:12,250
property right and that's what if it's a

00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:15,740
text book it's the value so that initial

00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:17,870
thing the first parameter is the initial

00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,100
value then we can go on to validators

00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:21,620
which we're going to talk about shortly

00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,900
and then even a single inators so the

00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,340
first thing we would probably do is just

00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,950
at this point in time just set it as

00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:30,620
empty right that's the initial value

00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:32,660
right okay so now we've actually created

00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:34,400
an instantiated our basic form control

00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,980
so now we need to link the through we

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,770
have the template and we have that so

00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:42,350
the way we do that is if we go to the

00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:46,220
HTML we would use what's the name of the

00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:49,120
property again yes but we have to bind

00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:51,580
it because we're providing a exactly

00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:56,670
form

00:42:51,580 --> 00:43:02,530
yeah oh I like that put it in a box

00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:07,660
oh yeah banana bus yeah I remember that

00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:09,970
I don't even know what the banana in the

00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,950
box means yeah that's like when you do

00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:16,720
this I think that's when you use the old

00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:18,610
forms you do to do to ng-model

00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:22,000
something like that it was like the

00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:28,830
worst idea that ever sorry if you

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:32,020
invented a yeah so would you say my form

00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:33,790
control right yeah so by doing this

00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:43,660
we've instantiated we've connected those

00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:46,920
to you right right oh we're in the wrong

00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,640
place good somebody's being offensive

00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,950
that's really good

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,970
yeah so they scraped it actually we

00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,170
wanted to see if you're paying attention

00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:56,160
yes

00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:58,690
it's a feature not a bug it's a feature

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,200
yeah oh yeah what totally the wrong

00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:07,930
component so we copy this and go to the

00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:10,390
app component - yes and then we put this

00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:14,440
here and we run the import right yeah

00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:19,810
okay and we take this here very good

00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:22,630
very good the end okay so now we have

00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:24,190
liftoff right so let's talk about that

00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:27,580
initial state value so right what if I

00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:29,260
wanted my initial state should be my

00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,070
favorite purse in the world which is

00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:35,080
Katerina

00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:36,850
I can say Katerina right and that would

00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,650
be like once the user even if i refresh

00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:42,010
this that would be the initial value

00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:46,090
right the initial value of that

00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:47,470
particular form so now that we've done

00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:48,340
that we're going to talk about the next

00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:48,730
thing we're going to talk about is the

00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,200
States

00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:53,920
well before we move on are there any

00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:55,870
questions any questions and I know for a

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,910
lot of you you already know this but

00:44:55,870 --> 00:45:00,220
it's something we have to do because we

00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:02,110
have to almost carry everybody along so

00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:03,580
it's like we meet you at your Junction

00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:05,040
you know there are some people who have

00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:06,360
never used forms we carried Emma

00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,890
and maybe hey I just want to know about

00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,180
foam gross we eventually get you a

00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:11,430
junction we pick you up just make sure

00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:15,000
that the bus stuff you know exactly so

00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:17,610
please please be with us alright so any

00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,620
questions about this so far any

00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:21,510
questions okay

00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:23,240
alright so let's go back to that foam

00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:26,690
control and actually have a look at

00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:29,970
these properties so if you look at like

00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,860
the foam control you can see that you

00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:34,980
know status invalid valid there has been

00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:37,290
inherited right from the abstract

00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,640
control level so these are actually not

00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,870
overeating they just inherited from the

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,150
abstract control level and then

00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:44,640
implement it there so oh the next we're

00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:46,020
going to talk about is States like what

00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,150
the form actually allows you to do so

00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,680
for example there's something called a

00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:54,660
state a bunch of states called like

00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:58,410
pristine right pristine is has like the

00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:00,030
initial value right being changed so if

00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:02,430
its pristine the initial value has not

00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:08,250
been changed right right

00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:10,590
well like durty is the initial value has

00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:12,420
been changed so as soon as you even if

00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:15,420
like the initial value is Katerina and

00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,710
you add a extra a at the end of like the

00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:20,520
name of Katerina and you delete that

00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:22,980
it's still now dirty because the initial

00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:25,800
value has been changed does that make

00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:29,700
sense so that's what it's so dirty and

00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:32,700
Pristina just like flip sides of each

00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:34,440
other right yeah and I asked a good

00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,510
question like why why not just push

00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,560
people in it I remember who I asked this

00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,330
question was like it's just readability

00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,920
it makes sense because if you're after

00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,570
pristine stage then you can just go

00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,730
pristine itself just negates in dirty

00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:46,740
you'd need to know what dirty meant but

00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:47,820
it just makes sense like that it's sort

00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,670
of reason why people sometimes have

00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:54,810
energy if and NGLs yeah that kind of

00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:56,130
thing any questions about that okay the

00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,960
next thing we have is touch under

00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:06,110
untouched does anybody know what

00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:06,110
touching and touch means yes

00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:12,760
okay yeah yeah that's that's actually

00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:14,619
pretty much I've seen 90% of the way you

00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:18,550
got it but there's another thing for the

00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:21,460
state to be touched right there's the

00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:24,849
focus the focus has to be it takes a

00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:28,930
candy to the focus so if you focus an

00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:30,339
input field right at that point you've

00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,800
touched it but the state touch has an

00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:34,420
actually chip until you lose focus

00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,369
because your cursor can only be on one

00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,140
input field that at one time so

00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:39,670
technically if you have a lost focus you

00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:43,780
actually haven't completed what it means

00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:46,030
to to to touch and then the untouched is

00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:48,460
I haven't actually you know the blur and

00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,809
the focus thing which gives you a head

00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,609
start like if you need to know when this

00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:53,290
person is this blurred or not you can

00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:55,240
actually know that okay the block and

00:47:53,290 --> 00:48:00,579
why do you think that state is important

00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:03,790
can anybody imagine why validation yes

00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:06,280
because if I want to show you or like a

00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:08,950
an error message yeah exactly what we

00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,450
talked in the first slide yes if I want

00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:12,849
to figure error message I need to know

00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:14,049
that you first interacted and then

00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:15,190
you've left they're not gonna show you

00:48:14,049 --> 00:48:16,809
the error message I don't want as soon

00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:18,579
as you interact oh my god you're doing

00:48:16,809 --> 00:48:20,710
something wrong it's like wait wait wait

00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:22,960
give me a minute let me make the mistake

00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:25,859
first exactly let me make my domestic

00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,859
first yes

00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,300
it's yes it's there so it's the reason

00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,040
why they pretty much just flips out of

00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:41,240
each other what is a bearing the ability

00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:42,800
because if you need like the idea the

00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,930
scenario be okay would have touch and

00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,309
you can negate touch right but then for

00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:47,599
readability that doesn't really do

00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:49,339
workers you need to know first of all

00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,050
what touch this and then to negate that

00:48:49,339 --> 00:48:53,380
but if you have just like touch and

00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:55,490
touch it's a very it's like a luxury

00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:58,160
solution that exists I don't know if

00:48:55,490 --> 00:49:00,260
that answers your question yes okay

00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,780
pretty good all right

00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:06,230
and so these are like the I guess the

00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:09,829
states that we have that exist on at

00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:12,859
least on a basic basic level pristine

00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:14,390
dirty touch and and touch right so let's

00:49:12,859 --> 00:49:17,599
should we play around with them a little

00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:22,510
bit to see what's it called right okay

00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:22,510
so let's go and do something let's do

00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:29,960
let's go here why don't we add like two

00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:31,609
spans right one for pristine and dirty

00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:35,210
should we start with that and see how

00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:36,890
they change correct okay so and maybe

00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:39,140
we'll understand better why there are

00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:46,460
four different ones instead of two to

00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:49,690
negate yes I like that is pristine right

00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:58,460
and let's maybe give it like a style

00:49:49,690 --> 00:50:00,980
like a color no I'm gonna give it to

00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:06,380
them this time I always do this I always

00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:12,530
spell it the right way color and I'm

00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:21,590
going to use maybe like let's just put

00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:26,930
red no okay let's just use blue and

00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:30,710
for dirty let's just use like red yeah

00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:32,780
like yeah sure is dirty right so let's

00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:35,030
let's preview that right its pristine

00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,890
it's dirty it's weird because of the

00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:41,120
Katrina is pristine it's dirty

00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:42,740
okay but yeah so let's do the wrong this

00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:45,320
which is BR which would we should

00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:46,430
probably be using that a line break

00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,730
actually now we will be using it

00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:50,150
correctly to the line break in the line

00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:52,730
right

00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:54,770
so like that right so we want when the

00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:56,660
foam is pristine pristine shows up and

00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:58,370
the form is dirty dirty shows up so how

00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:00,920
do we do that how can we use the state

00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:03,770
of this form now that's where we can

00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,180
actually use like let's use an NG if of

00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:07,790
course and maybe we don't need the

00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:10,220
second BR since only one of them is

00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:12,620
going to show up oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:18,170
that's true yes yes yes so we do an

00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:21,350
energy if so here we can actually see my

00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:22,700
phone control dot and we can access that

00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:27,410
property which property are we looking

00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:29,600
for anybody on pristine good very good

00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:32,450
so that means it was show only if the

00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:35,750
state proceeded is true and then we can

00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:39,020
just copy this part and do the same for

00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:42,140
dirty and you can see if it's dirty

00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:45,050
right yeah right so what do you think we

00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:48,860
show can anybody guess what do you think

00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:55,199
which of these states would be true why

00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:58,029
why pristine because what

00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:59,709
yes the value hasn't had changed it's

00:51:58,029 --> 00:52:01,779
all about the pristine and dirty is all

00:51:59,709 --> 00:52:03,459
about value change right so let's let's

00:52:01,779 --> 00:52:05,319
look at that so you can see its pristine

00:52:03,459 --> 00:52:07,959
even though it has an initial value but

00:52:05,319 --> 00:52:12,009
that initial value hasn't changed how so

00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:13,449
yeah so now you can change it we can so

00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:15,669
even though I come back to the initial

00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:17,799
value the same thing that state is a

00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:20,019
one-off it's it's gone now because you

00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:22,599
can leave I know for sure that the

00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:26,130
initial value has changed right okay so

00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:26,130
let's do very something very similar to

00:52:26,249 --> 00:52:38,049
what's it called for touch and touch

00:52:32,259 --> 00:52:47,229
right yeah okay it's touched it's

00:52:38,049 --> 00:52:49,660
untouched gouged so here we have the

00:52:47,229 --> 00:52:54,219
same property we could have touched and

00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:56,469
we can have untouched how did they spell

00:52:54,219 --> 00:52:59,019
and touch do they camelcase okay no they

00:52:56,469 --> 00:53:02,380
don't have a case yeah because it's one

00:52:59,019 --> 00:53:04,179
so we can do that right and we can come

00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,019
here so you can see that it's untouched

00:53:04,179 --> 00:53:07,479
right

00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:09,159
but even if I focus like this can you

00:53:07,479 --> 00:53:13,809
see that the untouched state and coming

00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:16,089
back to your point I've interacted with

00:53:13,809 --> 00:53:18,429
it but the untouched state is still true

00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:20,380
until I lose focus and then the touch

00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:21,669
state actually becomes true that's why

00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:23,529
it's very important for the validation

00:53:21,669 --> 00:53:25,329
because this is at this point it will

00:53:23,529 --> 00:53:27,549
make sense use the experience wise for

00:53:25,329 --> 00:53:29,349
me to then tell the user you haven't

00:53:27,549 --> 00:53:31,239
done something right but this feel

00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:33,669
correct makes sense

00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:35,859
pretty simple and I know it's not enough

00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:37,089
slow trust me you're gonna love what

00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:38,799
we've got for you but it's very

00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:42,009
important we walk through you know we

00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:43,209
carry everybody along okay so the next

00:53:42,009 --> 00:53:47,679
thing we're going to talk about is

00:53:43,209 --> 00:53:49,449
validators right which is there are

00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:51,699
different types of validators that we

00:53:49,449 --> 00:53:52,869
have to make sure that we're valuing

00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:56,069
what not what that why that is good is

00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:59,829
you can set of rules for the form and

00:53:56,069 --> 00:54:01,719
then only when those rules are true the

00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:03,969
form is valid and that way you can tie

00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:07,029
it with your submit button right so we

00:54:03,969 --> 00:54:09,740
can do something like that so let's have

00:54:07,029 --> 00:54:12,150
a look at validators

00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:13,500
so the thing with validators is you can

00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:15,930
actually create custom values and we're

00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,030
going to see that but more importantly

00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:21,780
they're built in validly there's a run I

00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:28,500
think how many of them let's count them

00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:31,680
email required yeah max land okay we can

00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:33,420
not count them but it's a bunch of them

00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,610
validators you can say something is

00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,590
required something you can have an email

00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:39,510
validator that says it has to be an

00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:41,640
email by the way don't use the email

00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:43,290
validator the default one because it

00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,140
uses the email specification so in the

00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:48,869
email specification my name and email is

00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:51,390
valid but in today's world my name an

00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:52,730
email dot something is a valid email but

00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:56,070
when email was originally created

00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:57,930
something apps something is valid so

00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:59,960
don't use the built in one because it

00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:02,520
captures a bigger case try to use them

00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:04,470
more than a regular expression so

00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,670
there's a pattern validator that matches

00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:05,970
to a regular expression that's much

00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:09,530
better

00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:11,960
oh yeah or create a custom one that just

00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:16,619
hits the email okay

00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:23,340
so let's quickly breeze through that and

00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:30,390
we can say yeah let's do the list let's

00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:31,710
go to validators yes so we can see the

00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:34,320
validate is actually so we can have

00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:36,000
minimum and I think that's when you want

00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,280
a specific number you're working a

00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,210
number value to be a minimum of Max and

00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:43,530
required required true this is actually

00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:46,650
the first time I'm see you required true

00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:50,310
I haven't got a clue what it does which

00:55:46,650 --> 00:56:02,070
is interesting you have email which was

00:55:50,310 --> 00:56:05,640
your favorite they use a lot yes I agree

00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:08,190
pattern is really at a million max

00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:09,810
length as well right so it's very

00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:11,940
similar to the actually built in HTML

00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:14,940
required stuff like the validators in

00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:16,650
HTML and with angular it actually

00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,180
recommended that you don't use the HTML

00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:19,770
validators it actually tells you it's

00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,920
not gonna break but it says like you're

00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:24,559
using this required validator is better

00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:27,950
- just set it in the it gives you this

00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:31,520
warning so you can actually have this

00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:37,460
required and and the way you can do it

00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:41,119
with a what's a cold is by going to

00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:44,599
custom in the constructor the volunteers

00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,520
come after the initial value yes and I

00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:49,250
think we should probably have a look at

00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:51,520
it right yeah you could go backward here

00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:54,829
so you can see here yeah it's you know

00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:57,829
the constructor for the phone control

00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:59,839
yeah so the second one is validated

00:56:57,829 --> 00:57:03,260
options which is a validation function

00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:04,730
or after are control options right so

00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:07,849
you can have like a validate function or

00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:09,099
or or an array of them as well so it's a

00:57:07,849 --> 00:57:11,780
bunch of different things you can pass

00:57:09,099 --> 00:57:13,339
right how do you like that when you have

00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,690
one validator do you use just one

00:57:13,339 --> 00:57:23,510
validator or you create an array with

00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:25,490
one in it how do you prefer yeah so yeah

00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:27,380
so I think it's best we teach them the

00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:30,049
array way so you can actually just come

00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:36,130
here and do validator and we you can get

00:57:30,049 --> 00:57:37,940
the validators a little validators i

00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:41,390
think it's valid deiner

00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:43,579
right yeah later so you can actually

00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:48,400
come here and like use one validator but

00:57:43,579 --> 00:57:48,400
all you can say validator Oh

00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:54,559
[Music]

00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:59,329
so private validators we could get the

00:57:54,559 --> 00:58:00,890
wrong way lest you validators and then

00:57:59,329 --> 00:58:02,660
you could do dot and you can have access

00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:03,770
to all those validators right so these

00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:06,349
are the built in validated so you can

00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:08,900
come here and say this is let's just try

00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:11,299
the basic one which is required right

00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:13,040
you can just say required by doing this

00:58:11,299 --> 00:58:15,140
you're saying basically you for this

00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:18,170
particular form field to be valid

00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:21,559
somebody must give it a value so when we

00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:24,890
launch I'm going to ask a trivia

00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:27,890
question with the input katarina right

00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:32,550
like this if i refresh the page is the

00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:35,160
form valid or not why is it valid

00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:36,800
because it required exactly exactly but

00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:39,720
if I have it like this would it be valid

00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:42,210
no because there isn't any value right

00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,680
exactly so that's how the validators

00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:45,720
work and you can cascade them so you can

00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:50,330
have multiple validators here you can

00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:54,240
say validator validators dot let's say

00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:59,240
yeah which you use maybe middle length

00:58:54,240 --> 00:59:03,330
should be okay eighty our eye and a

00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:07,520
eight so let's say if it was nine

00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:10,260
would this be valid if we put Katerina

00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:12,900
why because it's still not nine

00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:14,430
character so it cascades the validation

00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:18,450
would fail the phone will be invalid as

00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:21,140
long as long as one of them fails right

00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:24,420
it's only valid when all of them are

00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:26,400
valid all the validators have passed and

00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:29,040
you can also check their functions that

00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,470
allow you to check you know which

00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:34,200
specific valid it has failed so you can

00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:36,300
check like there's a formal group like

00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,920
up validators and then it'll give you

00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:43,920
all the validation you can see which one

00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:46,410
is true or false as well right okay yes

00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,020
this because if you want to know if the

00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:50,970
like if you have like to validate is

00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:53,070
like this right very important I need to

00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:55,680
know which one has failed right so for

00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:55,920
example for me if I want to show you an

00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,500
error

00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,930
the first validate our check is is it

00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:03,000
has the user put something then I sure

01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:05,970
that's my most important message right

01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,260
then if not I don't see have they put

01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:08,760
something but had they haven't reached

01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,740
seven characters what would really be

01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,000
crazy is I haven't put anything but it's

01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,680
trained me oh you need to put eight

01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,600
characters pass but it's like you know

01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,520
what first let me put a password first

01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,350
right and I think that's very useful for

01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,720
password it's like there's no point

01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:24,150
showing me put eight characters if I

01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:25,800
haven't put anything like tell me to put

01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:31,700
something first that helps me feel your

01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:31,700
form better if that makes sense yes

01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:40,630
for my user experience but if you out

01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:43,090
say no I would share one by one out I

01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:45,730
would I normally arrange my validation

01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:48,550
messages sometimes I create a component

01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:51,760
that does that but you have an order

01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:53,500
right let's use an example if I have a

01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,090
password field that it has to be

01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,950
required of course but has to be 8

01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:59,170
characters but it also needs to contain

01:00:56,950 --> 01:01:02,350
special characters like numbers right

01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:04,930
that's the order I first if the person

01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:06,310
hasn't put anything I'm not gonna show

01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:07,720
them the rest you I'm gonna be like you

01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:10,080
need to put me something first right

01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:12,280
then that's one and if they put like

01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:13,600
seven characters instead of eight then I

01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,520
show them oh you need eight characters

01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,750
that's the only error message they need

01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,280
to be concerned at that point because

01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:20,110
that's what I need to progressively fill

01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,940
that form and I even they put a

01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:23,800
characters but it don't have a number

01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:25,090
then I showed only the number was I

01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:34,890
wouldn't show all of them I would have

01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:34,890
an order yes

01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:49,049
[Music]

01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:51,419
so the best way to circle I would say

01:01:49,049 --> 01:01:53,519
that it depends on the case but I think

01:01:51,419 --> 01:01:56,189
most times its help for the user to

01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:58,289
solve one mistake at a time yes that's

01:01:56,189 --> 01:02:00,989
what I would say the way I would

01:01:58,289 --> 01:02:02,279
actually answer that is but that's more

01:02:00,989 --> 01:02:04,259
of a responsibility to the president

01:02:02,279 --> 01:02:06,179
signing so beef if you have a state you

01:02:04,259 --> 01:02:08,880
have rules that you want a user to

01:02:06,179 --> 01:02:11,429
submit to like those rules should be

01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,069
part of like just on top of the field

01:02:11,429 --> 01:02:15,779
that the label should say by the way you

01:02:14,069 --> 01:02:18,449
know create a password but the password

01:02:15,779 --> 01:02:20,160
needs to meet this these three so that

01:02:18,449 --> 01:02:22,289
way it's very clear what you're asking

01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,089
the user to do beforehand and then if

01:02:22,289 --> 01:02:25,859
they fail it what I like something that

01:02:24,089 --> 01:02:29,549
some password and some people do where

01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:33,689
they have like like you know six

01:02:29,549 --> 01:02:36,419
characters contains a number and like as

01:02:33,689 --> 01:02:38,130
you fill the as you meet the requirement

01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,569
lies like a check a green

01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:41,009
I like that experience pretty well

01:02:39,569 --> 01:02:42,509
because it shows okay I'm telling you

01:02:41,009 --> 01:02:44,849
exactly what I need but also as you feel

01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:46,589
it as you meet the requirement until you

01:02:44,849 --> 01:02:48,779
know I got you we're reactive forms you

01:02:46,589 --> 01:02:54,689
can you can know that good great

01:02:48,779 --> 01:02:56,309
question any question any questions okay

01:02:54,689 --> 01:02:58,229
should we go for our first review of the

01:02:56,309 --> 01:03:00,769
day yeah all right let's go file first

01:02:58,229 --> 01:03:06,299
review of the day so let me find that

01:03:00,769 --> 01:03:09,449
one I think okay no no it's not this one

01:03:06,299 --> 01:03:10,979
it's not this one it's this one so let's

01:03:09,449 --> 01:03:13,229
show you the first review of the day and

01:03:10,979 --> 01:03:14,819
this is where we're now gonna really so

01:03:13,229 --> 01:03:17,839
the first review of the day is a Twitter

01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:21,029
box I want you to actually build Twitter

01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:23,249
right and the main important thing is

01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:27,659
you notice what's the tweet button what

01:03:23,249 --> 01:03:30,539
is it here is it enabled or disabled so

01:03:27,659 --> 01:03:33,239
again it's actually disabled so if you

01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:35,789
look that and now it's enabled right but

01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:37,589
I'm able to disable it because there's a

01:03:35,789 --> 01:03:40,140
disabled property right what do you

01:03:37,589 --> 01:03:42,269
think I'm disabled in it why is it

01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:45,569
disabled which-which validated do you

01:03:42,269 --> 01:03:47,339
think I'm using so required exactly

01:03:45,569 --> 01:03:48,839
right perfect

01:03:47,339 --> 01:03:50,699
so as soon as as long as it's not

01:03:48,839 --> 01:03:53,749
required but also what you got a valid

01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:53,749
it is do you think I'll be use it

01:03:53,769 --> 01:04:00,650
yes max lent because twitter has 2,280

01:03:57,410 --> 01:04:02,210
character long thing right so I can use

01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:03,859
the max lent even though the maximum

01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:07,549
wouldn't really because I couldn't go

01:04:03,859 --> 01:04:09,019
ahead any like I had any is because of

01:04:07,549 --> 01:04:09,950
the HTML so you can just do max length

01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:12,289
equals to 80

01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:14,000
right but that week so you can see how

01:04:12,289 --> 01:04:17,329
with the forms I'm able to create these

01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:20,119
experiences right and then we also have

01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:24,890
a little trivia here where you can show

01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:28,339
us the account now we haven't taught you

01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:29,930
how to show what is and we're going to

01:04:28,339 --> 01:04:31,910
quickly talk about that because it's

01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:33,950
part of the challenge there's a value

01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:36,170
there's a property called value changes

01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:40,039
on every form control it's an observable

01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:41,390
that emits every time a value changes so

01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:42,980
it gives you the value so that value

01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:44,779
would be a string and then you can get

01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:46,160
the length of that string to say how

01:04:44,779 --> 01:04:48,019
many characters have the user put long

01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,380
and then just do a little bit of math to

01:04:48,019 --> 01:04:50,990
do that

01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:52,430
so this is the first challenge we want

01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:54,260
you to build a simple Twitter box you

01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:57,170
don't have to have styles but just as

01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:59,180
long as the the tweet button is

01:04:57,170 --> 01:05:00,859
validated and the the extra challenge is

01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:02,509
just a counter on the side and it's not

01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:05,359
too difficult and then we walk around

01:05:02,509 --> 01:05:10,210
and help how is that good right pretty

01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:15,069
good okay okay all right thanks let's go

01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:23,540
okay cat are you ready yeah do we okay

01:05:15,069 --> 01:05:27,890
alright so

01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:29,810
I guess this is where we would probably

01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:31,370
first open up the floor so if you

01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:34,550
actually want to share your screen with

01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:36,830
us to show us your solution or if you

01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:38,900
have in a problem as well we can put it

01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:40,910
up on the screen so first of all who

01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:42,800
here would like to show on the screen

01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:44,420
what they've done so I think is here

01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:50,660
good knowledge with everybody else

01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:54,170
anybody right okay so the the link is um

01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:56,600
I have a room here at up here that I n

01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:59,990
slash sami youssef and you could be able

01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:04,940
to go to that link quickly and it has a

01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:08,330
quick screen share thing so a P P up

01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:13,010
here that I n slash my name's sa and I

01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:14,900
why you suf I try to create like a ng

01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:20,150
confirm but they want me to pay for it

01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:26,720
so yeah a lot of houses with that money

01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:29,270
in Africa it's like the guy in black

01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:31,910
panther with the when he brings the

01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:34,430
hammer to to in the beginning it's like

01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:40,600
he's like yeah I thought about a fancy

01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:52,910
casing but all right

01:06:40,600 --> 01:07:00,700
are you there okay so should make you ap

01:06:52,910 --> 01:07:00,700
PE er that in4 - si + iy u su f

01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:22,070
I got my jacket up here dot i N okay

01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:29,270

know where you live

01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:39,140
all right

01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:41,420
okay so let's let him in all right then

01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:42,800
you should click the share screen and if

01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:45,860
you download a Chrome extension quickly

01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,640
it should take like two seconds and then

01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:50,960
you should be able to share your screen

01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:53,570
with us and let's make you visible to

01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:56,290
the world now it's a good time to call

01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:56,290
your browser history

01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:10,420
there we go so if you could increase the

01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:10,420
size of the box

01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:18,199
yeah probably for the IDE so that we can

01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:22,160
i yeah we can see the code all right uh

01:08:18,199 --> 01:08:23,960
yeah to the right oh yeah you want to

01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:28,100
close the mic you're right

01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:30,770
so can anybody see Oh bigger bigger a

01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:37,569
little bit bigger probably three three

01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:47,660
points bigger you can do command + o

01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:50,839
windows sorry okay yes that's there yeah

01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:53,060
I think we're good here right okay so

01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:55,969
let's see where do you've done

01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:58,489
I'll get pretty cool stuff so you can

01:08:55,969 --> 01:09:01,390
talk us and spend the next minute talk

01:08:58,489 --> 01:09:01,390
talk to us about what you've done

01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:26,060
unplug it yeah

01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:35,400
[Music]

01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:38,370
kill the mike he killed the Mike check

01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:42,080
check looks like I have an explosive

01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:45,390
voice yeah okay good

01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:47,820
so yeah I've employed some bootstrap

01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:50,010
here we've got yeah

01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:53,430
bootstrap form group so we've got the

01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:56,850
label at the top and then text area with

01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:58,650
the form control class yes and the true

01:09:56,850 --> 01:10:01,500
name and then I've got an NG class

01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:04,410
therefore the is invalid class we'll

01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:09,120
kind of employees the red outline there

01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:10,110
I think that was something I was working

01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,330
on originally so I probably actually

01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:14,160
removed that district in this instance

01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:17,940
if I wanted to roll this out just digits

01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:21,390
you just do the button no yeah at the

01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:24,570
sort of below there we've got the button

01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:31,530
and the Spain which is the badge those

01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:33,270
are awful due to the right and then I've

01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:37,050
got my disabled attributes

01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:38,790
tied to the invalid property on my form

01:10:37,050 --> 01:10:40,650
control so that will show if it's

01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:42,870
involved and then yeah at the bottom of

01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:45,990
got that clear fix to sort of get rid of

01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:47,940
the floating for the next items which

01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:51,600
sort of just display the properties yeah

01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:54,090
it looks pretty good that's a so the I'm

01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:57,210
guessing the the character count moving

01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:59,840
wasn't implemented the Mike the

01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:02,250
challenge sorry as I'd have to add the

01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,650
282 that component type script part yeah

01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:06,090
that's that's pretty I mean that one is

01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:08,190
just a challenge but this is this is

01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:09,810
pretty much it for the most part that's

01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:12,960
what everybody had what yeah what's your

01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:14,730
name again Joseph Joseph great work

01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,100
Joseph like really and I think Allah

01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:18,660
pretty much for the majority of the

01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,940
class you would have something pretty

01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:22,560
similar if you've completed before we

01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:26,420
showed our solution does anybody did

01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:27,660
anybody do the challenge the counter

01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:29,910
okay

01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:32,180
is that implemented would you like to

01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:32,180
show us

01:11:33,449 --> 01:11:39,280
said I get doesn't matter

01:11:35,469 --> 01:11:42,940
oh no nothing nope doesn't matter stick

01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:45,430
yeah come on share so yeah I'm gonna

01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:48,100
kick just about of the room now as you

01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:50,199
share is there somebody who controls the

01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:56,469
microphones on the sound who knows how

01:11:50,199 --> 01:11:57,100
can I turn off my microphone yeah okay

01:11:56,469 --> 01:12:01,000
thank you

01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:04,540
so just appear that I in it's like sunny

01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,850
Yusuf by the way this format is it do we

01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:08,140
like it like do we like the format the

01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:09,910
fact that people can share and actually

01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:12,520
we can see what other people are doing

01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:13,600
because it's like I think you humanizes

01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,100
everybody sure that you know we're we're

01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,120
not Jedi's or anything like literally

01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:19,380
we're doing the same thing you are doing

01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:19,380
as well you know

01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:37,350
yeah the appear in is not coming up for

01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:48,930
her appear in the username signing use

01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:58,640
of sa ni y-you suf yeah it looks like

01:12:48,930 --> 01:13:02,570
she has it right okay yeah I'm sorry

01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,570
I've got a very long name

01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:25,410
is this Chrome or Safari should be

01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:27,390
alright okay well we'll go ahead and

01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:29,610
show the solution the the Internet has

01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:33,330
not really helped us OB so that we can

01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:38,040
move on to the next stage but yeah so

01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:43,380
quickly we will show our solution oh is

01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:50,850
that you okay

01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:53,340
is that you oh is it you do you have the

01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:54,720
control working the counter okay what do

01:13:53,340 --> 01:14:06,060
you want to show us clearly share screen

01:13:54,720 --> 01:14:10,200
and then we can see yep there we go yep

01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:13,740
so you can show us your yep you can

01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:21,350
increase the font size and yeah let's

01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:21,350
see oh that's pretty good actually yeah

01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:25,730
wow that's pretty good that's way less

01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,930
lines of code than mine

01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:31,050
really I'm just looking like it's

01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:32,760
actually that simple yeah literally yeah

01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:34,920
you can see so he's using the value

01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,360
property and getting the length of that

01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,830
value property and just doing this

01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,630
complete math so that's not value

01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:42,300
property length is changing it's just

01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:52,500
also just reacting does that make sense

01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:54,330
everybody I ask any questions no no it's

01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,650
because for the control turret is

01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:56,700
checked the thing you wouldn't need the

01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:59,490
max thing you cuz you already know the

01:14:56,700 --> 01:15:01,140
280 you didn't get in the max length

01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:03,770
value you probably have a property that

01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:05,730
you'd be sharing a lie thank God so

01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:09,440
pretty good any questions before we

01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:11,690
proceed the good stuff

01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,520
did we enjoy that it's not a good

01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:16,580
exercise all right it gets harder don't

01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:19,940
worry it gets harder all right let's

01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:21,440
move on to the next stuff which is now

01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:23,840
we're going to actually show you how to

01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:25,760
work with form groups and then we'll

01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:30,920
show you how to so the next one we show

01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:32,300
you is a form groups so let's look at

01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:34,850
the time so we got around 30 minutes

01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:37,520
yeah so play around with let's let's

01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:39,590
let's let's let's quickly so we're going

01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:44,810
to go back to our little guy here

01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:46,880
remember this guy here right everybody

01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:48,530
remember this guy right so now let's say

01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,270
we have like a form when do we need

01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:52,280
actually to use a form group a form

01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:55,159
groom is very useful when we have like a

01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:57,440
a bunch of you know cascade in element

01:15:55,159 --> 01:15:59,179
so let's say we we want you to we've

01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,889
decided to actually you know what we

01:15:59,179 --> 01:16:03,440
want to do is we want to create a form

01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:05,690
where you can actually enter different

01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:07,969
like you know let's say email and two

01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:10,550
passwords correct that's probably a good

01:16:07,969 --> 01:16:13,850
one so we can start by by just say form

01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:15,770
here and inside that form we just close

01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:18,800
it down so we can remove everything here

01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:23,150
so we've done so far and in that form we

01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:27,880
can just do this here by the way is it

01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:33,500
visible enough to everybody or bigger

01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:40,520
huh not good okay all right so let's say

01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:46,000
input for email type equals email right

01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:46,000
and then we have another input here and

01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:57,290
type equals password so we want to email

01:16:51,850 --> 01:17:03,320
password and let's probably use

01:16:57,290 --> 01:17:05,239
placeholder enter password this is

01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:07,130
probably the mostly the least accessible

01:17:05,239 --> 01:17:10,460
form so please do not do try this at

01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:12,350
home use labels these IDs use Aria

01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:13,909
labels as well don't forget your Aria

01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:15,409
labels just like your vegetables the

01:17:13,909 --> 01:17:18,380
good for you even though you don't like

01:17:15,409 --> 01:17:21,020
to put them you know good for you and

01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:23,000
then I can just copy paste this and then

01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:26,030
just say confirm

01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,130
right we can do something like that and

01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:30,620
we can go see the world's most beautiful

01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:33,350
form right exactly

01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:34,880
so here you put an email address here

01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:36,590
you put a password and you here for the

01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,270
confirm password right now

01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:39,620
the craziest thing would be it would be

01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:40,910
to create three individual input

01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:42,890
controls because that would that would

01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:44,390
not be very wise of us because then

01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:45,530
we'll be maintaining three things so

01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:48,020
that's where the farm group actually

01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:50,000
comes in very handy so with a foam group

01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:56,690
who would just go back here and we'll

01:17:50,000 --> 01:18:00,980
just create my form group and form group

01:17:56,690 --> 01:18:04,490
and we just go here and we should be

01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:08,780
able to have it group and let's actually

01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:10,520
use the form builder so here we can

01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:12,920
actually just gonna do my form group

01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:15,530
equals new form group you know it Stan

01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:16,580
she did the imperative way but it's

01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:19,340
something called a flow builder that

01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:21,410
allows you to declaratively build this

01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:23,900
out that's what one of the things we're

01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:28,940
going to see now so let's go and say

01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:33,130
okay this this dot does a name of your

01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:39,890
company this dot now I get it

01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:43,010
genius that makes me sound really

01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:46,760
because I didn't get it area alright

01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:48,350
this is the live form group equals so we

01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,910
use a farm bill done for they cuz the

01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:55,210
formula is like a little service so we

01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:58,130
can just say form builder and then for

01:18:55,210 --> 01:19:02,570
builder so we inject it with dependency

01:18:58,130 --> 01:19:05,720
injection and we can say form builder

01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:07,610
dot so you can see that three it it has

01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:09,020
an array function if you need to declare

01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:10,580
to create an array you also have the

01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:12,890
control one if you use the control but

01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:14,690
probably it doesn't make sense the

01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:18,230
footprint it just doesn't make sense

01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:21,560
so we'd call the group and what does it

01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:24,770
take it takes in an object as a

01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:26,360
parameter right where we can create key

01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:27,680
value pairs so what do you think will be

01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:29,090
the first thing we'd want to name our

01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:34,850
first input field what was a good name

01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:36,739
for that first input field email exactly

01:19:34,850 --> 01:19:38,949
so we're just going to say email and

01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:41,329
we have the same thing so initial-value

01:19:38,949 --> 01:19:42,949
validators and all the dots so the

01:19:41,329 --> 01:19:44,239
initial value here what do you think

01:19:42,949 --> 01:19:51,949
would want to validate here as the

01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:53,360
validator said I again will probably

01:19:51,949 --> 01:19:56,150
wanted to be required right yeah we

01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,889
wanted to enter to enter that right yeah

01:19:56,150 --> 01:20:00,110
I know I said don't use the email

01:19:57,889 --> 01:20:01,730
validator which you dude but we're gonna

01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:03,170
use it because we don't have time to go

01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:04,909
to I stack place but probably in your

01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:07,369
own you can use likes tablets use a

01:20:04,909 --> 01:20:10,269
validated of pattern and do a pattern

01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:16,460
match right so I'm just gonna say

01:20:10,269 --> 01:20:17,989
validators don't email know because

01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:19,519
you're using a form builder so that the

01:20:17,989 --> 01:20:21,170
new form control is the imperative way

01:20:19,519 --> 01:20:23,119
you could use that but then you end up

01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:24,949
like new control you have a lot about

01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:27,289
the form bill that allows you to just

01:20:24,949 --> 01:20:29,059
create like an object and and it would

01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:31,420
do all of that behind the scene for you

01:20:29,059 --> 01:20:33,710
which we makes it a little bit cleaner

01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:38,570
so the the other one would be password

01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:39,710
and I think password we can say validate

01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:46,909
is what about it is should we use it

01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:51,010
required right okay and what do you

01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:54,019
think we should use after mini--length

01:20:51,010 --> 01:21:04,280
maybe eight right yeah let's keep it

01:20:54,019 --> 01:21:11,499
simple 24 okay middle and middle length

01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:11,499
is we put 800 sorry not mean min length

01:21:12,309 --> 01:21:19,190
yeah there we go

01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:21,289
8 I'm just gonna copy this and do that

01:21:19,190 --> 01:21:22,909
unless maybe we'll come the coldest one

01:21:21,289 --> 01:21:25,940
confirm on the scroll password right

01:21:22,909 --> 01:21:28,489
that's probably a good day confirm

01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:28,999
password right then it's the same thing

01:21:28,489 --> 01:21:31,909
correct

01:21:28,999 --> 01:21:33,650
oh good so far everybody following right

01:21:31,909 --> 01:21:38,389
and now we have so we can actually have

01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:42,139
like a what's the code so how do we wire

01:21:38,389 --> 01:21:43,849
this up if we go to here at the forum

01:21:42,139 --> 01:21:45,229
level there's a group the same year we

01:21:43,849 --> 01:21:48,860
had form control we have another

01:21:45,229 --> 01:21:50,449
property code form group and we can do

01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:54,890
form group equals

01:21:50,449 --> 01:21:57,110
my for group then how do we individually

01:21:54,890 --> 01:22:00,320
Caskey this is actually one place where

01:21:57,110 --> 01:22:00,620
I have some arguments with the what's it

01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,110
called

01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:04,910
because Elias has just created something

01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:07,130
new and it was like it would be nice if

01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:09,440
in future versions of angular it just

01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:10,580
uses your name property so it forces you

01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,260
to actually provide a name property

01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:14,080
which is pretty good for validation and

01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:16,040
there's feeds of that name property

01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:18,050
although I can see why they did it our

01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:19,370
way they force you to declaratively put

01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:21,770
it because they want you to be very sure

01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:25,330
like it's one-to-one so here you have

01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:29,270
like a thing called form control name

01:22:25,330 --> 01:22:31,489
control name like that and then you just

01:22:29,270 --> 01:22:34,969
associate that so you can say email so

01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:40,160
you associate that right yeah and then

01:22:34,969 --> 01:22:41,270
we can do the same for password and we

01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:44,739
can do the thing for confirm password

01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:50,060
it's confirmed on the score

01:22:44,739 --> 01:22:56,239
no no in the context yeah yeah confirm

01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:58,670
and let's go password right so big set

01:22:56,239 --> 01:23:01,760
so far make sense so what you've done is

01:22:58,670 --> 01:23:03,260
you've not associated that so if you

01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:10,130
have like a submit button here

01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:11,900
I bought it which is like it's a bit and

01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:14,360
also there's another thing engi submit

01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:15,469
you can use which is basically it hooks

01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:16,850
into the submit button so you can have

01:23:15,469 --> 01:23:19,699
the button in the context of the form

01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:23,300
and then once you do that and you submit

01:23:19,699 --> 01:23:25,969
it's not it's I don't know where I stand

01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:26,840
in terms of people always use ng sign I

01:23:25,969 --> 01:23:28,929
don't know Carter II know what do you

01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,929
think

01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:42,450
mmm I agree it's not mandatory but just

01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:45,910
to know there's there's a day's a

01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:47,500
function of an event you can hook into

01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:48,610
which is ng submit and then provide a

01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,350
function so now when the submit button

01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:54,490
gets fired in the context of the forum

01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:58,720
it just so it mimics the old post get

01:23:54,490 --> 01:24:01,210
form mechanism so here we can yeah the

01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:05,530
form action exactly thank you so here we

01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:10,390
can do the disabled and equals my form

01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:12,300
group here microphone group dot invalid

01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:14,800
but also you can actually access

01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:18,400
individual elements you can say my phone

01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:20,080
group dot you can say don't get and then

01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:22,590
you can pass a name of a particular

01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:25,120
child to get the control of that child

01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:27,430
so if you if you like a bunch of

01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:29,440
validation messages here not specific to

01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:32,530
email you do my phone group don't get

01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:33,970
dot email right and then that's what you

01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:36,490
used to check for those validations if

01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:39,040
that makes sense right but yeah we can

01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:42,010
do something like that but anyways let's

01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,540
just quickly have a look you can see the

01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:48,250
submit button so for us to actually make

01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:51,400
this valid we can just do sunny add sani

01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:54,010
calm and then we can say one two three

01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:56,740
four five six seven eight and one two

01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:59,350
three four five six seven eight right

01:24:56,740 --> 01:25:01,690
and now it's actually valid because

01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:03,550
we've fulfilled the requirement of the

01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:05,320
form so you can see we don't really need

01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:06,520
to know have they entered the email or

01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:08,560
password we're just telling the form hey

01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:11,800
mister form or your children are they

01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:13,690
valid and he says yes the rules you said

01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:15,910
have been obeyed so I shall let them

01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:18,250
pass that way you don't need to watch

01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:19,480
individual hey email are you valid now

01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:21,610
the form just tells you I'm gonna

01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:22,900
calculate that for you right any

01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:26,700
questions before we proceed to the

01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:26,700
challenge yes sir

01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:37,370
yes it's just about so it's about

01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:39,890
preference and cleanability clean code

01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:43,400
really with if we were going to do this

01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:46,660
the the imperative way we would have to

01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:51,380
do something like you know this this

01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:58,640
about my form group equals to you know

01:25:51,380 --> 01:26:00,440
new for group you know and then I think

01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:02,510
we need to passing like an empty value

01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:05,510
like an object as well right here and

01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:07,190
they would now say this there's a

01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:09,350
function called this that my form group

01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:11,540
that I think register control or our

01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:13,040
control then you need to add and inside

01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:15,020
then you not need to create an instance

01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:17,450
of phone control so you can see how it

01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:21,590
just three controls you need like you

01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:23,030
know 79 lines of code but with this way

01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:23,990
you could just declaratively pass also

01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:25,550
this way if you're getting something

01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:27,050
from Jade like a JSON from the server

01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:29,200
it's much easier you can just pass that

01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:31,970
object so you can have like server-side

01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:33,830
code that would just populate that for

01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:36,740
you if that makes sense so it's it's not

01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:39,880
better or worse it's just a thing of

01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:47,930
preference really yeah any questions

01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:49,880
before we proceed okay so I guess before

01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:51,650
because let's see well how much okay so

01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,330
we we might as well did because this

01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:55,730
this particular one is two stages

01:26:53,330 --> 01:27:00,940
so a bowser Brandon who can see was

01:26:55,730 --> 01:27:00,940
potentially wrong with our form here yes

01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:07,130
there that's the guy always the Tesla

01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:09,260
exactly

01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:11,240
so if you notice because we said for a

01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:13,070
password to be valid it needs to just be

01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:14,960
required and it characters the same for

01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:16,730
the confirm password which means if I

01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:19,340
type one two three four five six seven

01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:21,230
eight and password and what eight four

01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:22,970
is seven six five four three two one and

01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:26,060
confirm password this form would still

01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:28,670
be valid because there's no it's not

01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:33,680
check in so let's see that in action so

01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:37,250
if I type you know like here Sani add

01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:40,720
sani calm you know one two in fact you

01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:44,330
know I can just do better now does do

01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:46,780
it's valid which is crazy because as

01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:50,480
long as this form is concerned it's I've

01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:52,850
given eight characters and I've also you

01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:55,460
know it's required but there is no way

01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:58,340
for us to check that the two of them so

01:27:55,460 --> 01:28:00,650
now that validator there's no way we can

01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:03,770
do that right and this is a problem so

01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:06,830
that's where the we have validators on

01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:08,270
the form level so you can valid it on

01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:10,400
the formula but not just on the

01:28:08,270 --> 01:28:12,440
individual control level and that's why

01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:15,200
we need to clear what I call a custom

01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:21,740
validator right so let's see what how we

01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:24,400
create a custom validator right so for

01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:28,460
us so if you look at this form builder

01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:31,460
the first thing here is an object right

01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:34,160
but we can actually have comma and we

01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:40,700
have another object where we can pass a

01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:42,290
valid data and we can actually provide

01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:45,350
an array of validators for this

01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:49,220
particular form to be valid so we can

01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:51,080
use the same validator for the form so

01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:52,610
how would we do that we could but we

01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:55,040
need a custom validators how do we

01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:57,140
create custom validators okay let me

01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:00,770
actually go back to one of my code and

01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:06,110
copy that and quickly yeah so I actually

01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:07,790
have created it to save us time so the

01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:10,310
good thing with the custom validator is

01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:11,690
they literally just functions I think

01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:13,850
that's one thing I really really really

01:29:11,690 --> 01:29:14,930
like they let me just function that we

01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:17,120
can just create our functions in the

01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:18,650
context of the class here

01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:21,680
or even the context of outside the class

01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:23,720
really just just a function it's just a

01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:26,180
function you pass right that's what the

01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:30,710
validate the validator is so I am gonna

01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:35,180
use a validated error so here all I have

01:29:30,710 --> 01:29:39,950
done is I've said so for here it will be

01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:44,420
like confirm on the score password right

01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:46,280
so now let's see how we actually

01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:48,320
associate this particular validator here

01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:50,930
we put it in this array password match

01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:52,430
so the name of the function what you do

01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:53,720
because of gene JavaScript functions are

01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:55,310
first class this is so you're just throw

01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:57,620
you're not invoking the function you're

01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:59,090
just saying when you need to even though

01:29:57,620 --> 01:30:01,460
you've validated all those individual

01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:03,980
thing here is a group level validator I

01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:05,360
you need to run right but also this

01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:07,220
validating you can not only create

01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,570
validators for the group level but you

01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:12,140
can also create them for the control

01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:15,080
level so if you can create just an it's

01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:16,550
just a function that and if it was for

01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:18,650
the control level this would be it would

01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:21,290
taking an input as a form control or

01:30:18,650 --> 01:30:23,300
whatever you want associated with so at

01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:25,040
runtime that would get injected and this

01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:28,160
function would run and the function

01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:30,050
needs to return either true when it's

01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:32,210
wrong or undefined when everything is

01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:34,550
okay and not that's a bit weird like why

01:30:32,210 --> 01:30:36,020
would you return true when something is

01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:38,360
wrong it's like if I want to know

01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:41,000
something is invalid that validity that

01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:42,200
invalid in validity needs to be true so

01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,290
if I want to know if the confirm

01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:48,050
password validator should be true only

01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:50,240
when confirm password is it's not okay

01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:51,830
right if the two powers haven't matched

01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:54,500
and that's the thing so that's what

01:30:51,830 --> 01:30:57,170
we're doing here or say I'm going to

01:30:54,500 --> 01:31:00,230
associate this password match function

01:30:57,170 --> 01:31:02,570
with a form group now take that form

01:31:00,230 --> 01:31:04,820
group find a property called password

01:31:02,570 --> 01:31:07,430
find another property code confirm

01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:09,500
password check if their values are the

01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:11,450
same if the values are the same right

01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:14,810
everything's okay so you can return null

01:31:11,450 --> 01:31:15,830
or undefined right else if the values

01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:18,410
are not okay

01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:19,970
then you return password match true so

01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:21,320
this would be the name of the error this

01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:22,580
password match would be in the name of

01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:26,750
the error that a user can check is

01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:29,540
password match you know error is it true

01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:30,900
not we yes pass what much error is true

01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:32,760
because something

01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:35,219
has happened so it does take a while for

01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:36,780
you to like you know like get around

01:31:35,219 --> 01:31:38,580
that like wow is it true but it makes

01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:39,690
perfect sense because if that's what

01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:41,880
matters false then you're saying

01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:44,730
everything is okay it doesn't make sense

01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:46,920
that way and that's this is how we we

01:31:44,730 --> 01:31:52,920
associate those two and now if we check

01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:55,080
that and we say San E and San E calm and

01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,550
we put one two three four five six

01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:58,440
wait hold on I need to know what I'm

01:31:56,550 --> 01:32:03,199
typing one two three four five six seven

01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:03,199
I meet one two three four five five six

01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:12,380
five six eight eight so you can see I

01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:15,110
put in here one 1 two 2 three 3 four 4

01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:18,900
but you can see the submit button is not

01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:23,370
because it's both valid valid as long as

01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:27,000
we're concerned here right on email is

01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:29,730
valid on line 16 because it's being

01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:32,130
fulfilled right password is also valid

01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:34,710
at this point right confirm password is

01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:37,409
also valid but then the form level is

01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:39,270
saying you then need to check this

01:32:37,409 --> 01:32:41,909
particular validator but that validator

01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:43,620
will fail so they're all good but the

01:32:41,909 --> 01:32:45,690
validator is now going to fail so that

01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:47,070
way you can control that you can even go

01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:49,920
as far as making that function

01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:52,739
programmable way it receives inputs of

01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:55,260
the name of the controls so that you can

01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:57,810
reuse it I don't go as far as that I try

01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:59,460
to make my custom validators one-to-one

01:32:57,810 --> 01:33:02,550
match with the form I'm using it because

01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:04,440
when you try to create multi you end up

01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:06,600
with like I call a god function well oh

01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:09,270
yeah is validates here and here not make

01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:12,030
it very one-to-one right does this make

01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:21,110
sense right pretty cool stuff

01:33:12,030 --> 01:33:21,110
okay so yeah she yes yes

01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:39,930
so again that's part of the spec the

01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:42,090
spec says you've done undefined on now

01:33:39,930 --> 01:33:44,220
when everything is okay that means

01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:45,960
nothing is happening but when you return

01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:47,400
true then that means you want to capture

01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:50,400
the users attention you want to let this

01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:51,600
form know something's wrong that's true

01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,220
and that's why you always want to have

01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:56,940
only one true statement being returned

01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:58,640
right in fact I think part of the you

01:33:56,940 --> 01:34:00,990
don't actually necessarily need to know

01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:03,540
because it's undefined by nature if it

01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:05,070
checks there I think the spec I like to

01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:06,780
just be very I think the reason why I do

01:34:05,070 --> 01:34:08,880
it sometimes for junior developers I've

01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:10,200
just joined it's better sometimes for

01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,850
readability that they see something's

01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:14,340
returned because they wouldn't know that

01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:16,050
this is what the spec says so I but for

01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:17,610
the if you're in a team where you know

01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:20,250
what you're like everybody knows angular

01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:22,170
properly you just need to return the the

01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:23,490
true case and forget about the undefined

01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:39,810
case because that's already the case

01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:41,490
right yes so questions yes absolutely so

01:34:39,810 --> 01:34:43,550
there's something called the in the palm

01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:46,260
control there's a property called errors

01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:48,960
right if you look at that let's actually

01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:51,450
look at that on the form group level so

01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:59,370
I think we have the form group open yeah

01:34:51,450 --> 01:35:00,900
we did form group okay from group from

01:34:59,370 --> 01:35:02,010
group let's go to the form group so if

01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:06,600
you look at that there's something

01:35:02,010 --> 01:35:08,730
called dad is it errors here we go so

01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:10,590
you can see that errors is an array of

01:35:08,730 --> 01:35:13,200
all the current errors that have failed

01:35:10,590 --> 01:35:16,380
right and then you can access what you

01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:18,540
can do is you can you can even it's a

01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:20,730
it's a function actually you can pass in

01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:22,560
as a parameter a name of that particular

01:35:20,730 --> 01:35:26,280
error so the name of that error in this

01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:27,990
case would be this password match so you

01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:30,500
pass a string called password match and

01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:32,970
now we return you true if password match

01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:34,650
now that true makes sense it passed what

01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:37,140
match has failed then that will be

01:35:34,650 --> 01:35:39,750
returned and then you can react that way

01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:41,760
does that make sense from the HTML yes

01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:44,250
any final question because we're quickly

01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:49,650
run out of time before we move on to the

01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:51,120
challenge good good stuff okay so this

01:35:49,650 --> 01:35:52,620
is the challenge that we have for you is

01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,210
pretty quick we have one more thing

01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:57,690
today but we're probably going to need

01:35:54,210 --> 01:36:02,280
to run that quickly and so the challenge

01:35:57,690 --> 01:36:04,050
we have for you today is this where this

01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:06,420
is what it looks like it's pretty much

01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:07,770
what we've just done really I want you

01:36:06,420 --> 01:36:10,470
to go ahead and actually implement that

01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:11,820
like just you know email address

01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:16,920
password and confirm password and use

01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:18,360
that custom validator yes try to display

01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:19,920
some sort of error message like for

01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:21,990
example if the two passwords don't match

01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,670
have an error message that means you

01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:26,580
need to access that errors property and

01:36:23,670 --> 01:36:29,220
then do that that's the extra challenge

01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:31,050
pretty good so you only have like around

01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:35,270
five minutes for that so that we can

01:36:31,050 --> 01:36:35,270
round up and do the async custom

01:36:40,520 --> 01:37:06,750
yes sir good yes sir I define the

01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:09,840
function locally where very locally

01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:12,470
well yeah you should be able to just

01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:16,740
pass it but you'd have to do this dot

01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:26,570
uh-huh so what is happening highlight

01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:31,220
highlight here well no no no no not

01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:39,810
validators : it's pretty value peninnah

01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:40,170
outside this yeah this is : yeah there

01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:43,170
we go

01:37:40,170 --> 01:38:01,710
yeah no problem

01:37:43,170 --> 01:38:03,980
yes sir what's that let's see let's see

01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:06,930
go back so the problem you're having is

01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:10,500
password control that value equals

01:38:06,930 --> 01:38:15,060
passive we turn no else return true

01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:18,870
right and validators this is I think

01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:21,800
uppercase v I believe it's uppercase v

01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:21,800
yeah

01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:26,050
you know try it down

01:38:35,330 --> 01:38:38,740
hey hold up go back

01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:53,780
hmm validate have you saved everything

01:38:47,120 --> 01:39:03,250
make sure you have saved on and it's

01:38:53,780 --> 01:39:03,250
probably a lowercase V that validators

01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:26,100
yeah there's something amiss I let me

01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:28,080
have a quick look at the code yes yes no

01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:31,470
it has to be my my phone group is not a

01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:34,530
building so my computer invalid as an

01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:37,860
invalid property yes yeah that's when

01:39:34,530 --> 01:39:39,210
you want to disabled yes when is the

01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:43,110
night next talking here do you have the

01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:48,120
schedule five minutes so there's the

01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:53,440
next clock except maybe Italy after okay

01:39:48,120 --> 01:40:02,640
thanks okay

01:39:53,440 --> 01:40:02,640
so how are we doing guys people okay

01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:18,630
like Target Field like fuel specific

01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:21,900
custom validator yeah you can talk about

01:40:18,630 --> 01:40:23,550
those too you just use because it gives

01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:24,810
you access to the form group so this for

01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:27,750
group is this phone group that we

01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:30,180
injected so you just call dot get and

01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:31,950
then pass in the name exactly this is

01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:33,690
okay also you can also customize it to

01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:35,970
actually get that value as a parameter

01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:45,690
that's that's a bit overkill sometimes

01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:48,120
yeah object an object of key of the name

01:40:45,690 --> 01:40:56,040
and then values true so returning an

01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:58,530
object yeah an object with the key an

01:40:56,040 --> 01:41:00,870
object object return an object where the

01:40:58,530 --> 01:41:03,150
key is passed then make the error

01:41:00,870 --> 01:41:06,690
message and then the value is true yeah

01:41:03,150 --> 01:41:09,180
yeah okay all right

01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:10,740
all right we're gonna see the solution

01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:12,240
now we're gonna rush off because we

01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:13,410
still have one more thing to show which

01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:15,390
we wouldn't be able to have a challenge

01:41:13,410 --> 01:41:16,830
you know I actually specifically you

01:41:15,390 --> 01:41:19,500
know build that like for this particular

01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:23,240
crowd but hey it is what it is

01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:27,900
so let's let's show the the results

01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:30,990
quickly okay so this is what the result

01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:32,960
looks like well I think we've probably

01:41:30,990 --> 01:41:36,030
already seen cuz we built the results

01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:37,710
yeah it went through but let's just see

01:41:36,030 --> 01:41:40,230
what the original looks like we're gonna

01:41:37,710 --> 01:41:43,050
close this guy and we're gonna close

01:41:40,230 --> 01:41:46,980
this guy we're gonna come here in our

01:41:43,050 --> 01:41:48,720
demo but I know by the way again

01:41:46,980 --> 01:41:51,240
Katrina's gonna be tweeting these links

01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:52,590
so you know they'll be all available

01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:54,420
stock was to be available for you to

01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:56,940
actually go you can fork it you can play

01:41:54,420 --> 01:42:01,430
around with it right so so Johnny and I

01:41:56,940 --> 01:42:04,530
am Twitter yeah absolutely things so

01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:06,120
let's see where where is it where is it

01:42:04,530 --> 01:42:07,380
okay you know we're just gonna show so

01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:10,710
it's pretty much what we've done you

01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:12,300
know validators and you've just shown a

01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:15,330
custom value here and you can have as

01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:16,350
many as possible right and not so this

01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:17,940
is probably gonna be available so the

01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:19,080
last one we want to do is the async

01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:21,150
validator

01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:22,950
what's an async validator sometimes you

01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:25,080
want to cuss a ballot date but you need

01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:27,740
to make some asynchronous call when do

01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:30,990
you think that will be useful anybody

01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:34,230
said again user name check-in

01:42:30,990 --> 01:42:36,150
what about shopping right you want to

01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:39,440
shop you want to check if the user lives

01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:43,620
in a location sentry stuff right

01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:45,870
availability a lot of things so but that

01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:48,120
so that means the form has to then wait

01:42:45,870 --> 01:42:50,670
to calculate its validity and angular

01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:52,650
knows that because angular's state is

01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:55,350
not just valid or invalid s also a state

01:42:52,650 --> 01:42:57,000
called pending which means it's in the

01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:59,580
middle I am waiting for something to

01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,800
complete for me to calculate my state

01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:04,230
now when you can be aware so let's see

01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:06,930
what a custom validator is that the demo

01:43:04,230 --> 01:43:09,720
we've built is specific to actually the

01:43:06,930 --> 01:43:12,690
USA and I think I demoed this last year

01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:16,110
actually and my talk but it's very

01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:19,290
similar it's we want to check based on

01:43:16,110 --> 01:43:21,440
your postcode right if we deliver to you

01:43:19,290 --> 01:43:26,820
so for example we have this particular

01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:28,980
thing here where what we do is we want

01:43:26,820 --> 01:43:32,340
you to put in your your zip code I keep

01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:34,350
saying postcode zip code right we want

01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:36,360
you to put your zip code and then we can

01:43:34,350 --> 01:43:38,930
check so the way I've written this code

01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:41,610
is to check I only deliver to California

01:43:38,930 --> 01:43:44,220
so if you don't live in California you

01:43:41,610 --> 01:43:46,680
don't you're not gonna see that but how

01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:50,700
do we know that so actually there's this

01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:53,580
website called zippopotamas how does

01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:56,310
anybody know zippopotamas is it Zippo

01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:58,230
parts of the US and it actually has a

01:43:56,310 --> 01:44:00,390
bunch of countries that it has access to

01:43:58,230 --> 01:44:02,460
the code post code or zip code system

01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:04,800
and the United State is one so when you

01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:08,400
actually use so let's just see United

01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:11,640
States and see a sample where is USA

01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:14,550
yeah so we can actually see this sample

01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:16,710
here and this is the sample JSON I guess

01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:18,630
return it gives you the postcode it

01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:21,240
gives you the country it gives you the

01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:23,070
country abbreviation the place is the

01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:25,500
state abbreviation the latitude and

01:44:23,070 --> 01:44:30,000
longitude everything right and this is

01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:31,920
real data that exists so imagine if

01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,090
we're building like an Amazon right

01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,770
that'll come down we need to know your

01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:38,940
postcode so that we can save you time or

01:44:34,770 --> 01:44:40,380
fill in this form right and that's what

01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:43,020
we been able to do here so let's

01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:47,910
actually go on and have a look at this

01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:49,860
particular piece of code here it is so

01:44:47,910 --> 01:44:51,989
you can see it's a it's a custom

01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:54,090
validator above a custom ASIC validators

01:44:51,989 --> 01:44:55,620
when you they normally have dependencies

01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:57,000
so you need to make those dependents you

01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:59,130
need to inject them for in this case we

01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,900
need the HTTP client because we need to

01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:03,239
know that we are gonna make an HTTP call

01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:04,860
so we're providing it ahead of time or

01:45:03,239 --> 01:45:06,989
injecting into the custom validator and

01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:08,969
this is what that function looks like we

01:45:06,989 --> 01:45:11,460
provide the HTTP client and then we

01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:13,170
return the normal custom validation

01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:15,600
function which is going to be of course

01:45:13,170 --> 01:45:18,060
in this case you can see we are

01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:19,590
associated with a form control so here

01:45:18,060 --> 01:45:20,670
we're making it very clear it's a foam

01:45:19,590 --> 01:45:22,170
control that's going to be used with

01:45:20,670 --> 01:45:24,420
this and what we're saying is we're

01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:26,219
getting that form control value this is

01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:30,510
the control here the value of that

01:45:26,219 --> 01:45:32,790
control right as the API call so I say

01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:35,550
zippopotamas the US four slash whatever

01:45:32,790 --> 01:45:39,360
the user gives me right and then we're

01:45:35,550 --> 01:45:41,010
using our xjx operators to get the state

01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:44,400
which are trying to check in the state

01:45:41,010 --> 01:45:45,900
is California if it's California then we

01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:48,900
just return you know

01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:51,300
null because everything is okay if not

01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:52,860
then we catch the error and then we

01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:54,600
return like the error name state

01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:56,580
delivery and all of that so it's the

01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:59,310
same thing if everything is okay return

01:45:56,580 --> 01:46:02,219
undefined or no if not return an object

01:45:59,310 --> 01:46:04,020
that is wrap either as a promise or an

01:46:02,219 --> 01:46:06,540
observable so I I'm gonna help you that

01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:08,940
so you can return on a promise that

01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:12,510
resolves with other objects of an error

01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:14,070
right or a promise or an observable or

01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:15,960
just an object as well just like the

01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:17,460
normal thing if not just return or

01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:20,100
probably some undefined to sure that

01:46:17,460 --> 01:46:21,239
everything is okay oh good right so

01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:24,750
let's see how that works

01:46:21,239 --> 01:46:27,929
do you have something okay so who can

01:46:24,750 --> 01:46:32,100
tell who lives in California here Oh a

01:46:27,929 --> 01:46:34,739
lot a lot of rich people okay so can you

01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:38,910
tell us what you live we promised we

01:46:34,739 --> 01:46:45,060
would not stalk you San Diego and like a

01:46:38,910 --> 01:46:45,750
zip code yeah 92108 so we do deliver to

01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:48,150
you

01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:58,940
does anybody live anywhere that is in

01:46:48,150 --> 01:47:02,520
California yes 0 1 7 5 2 so yeah sorry

01:46:58,940 --> 01:47:04,850
yeah but this is this this error is

01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:07,500
really reacting based on a real

01:47:04,850 --> 01:47:11,040
asynchronous call right and we can see

01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:14,550
the HTML here we're showing you that

01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:15,870
error based on that has error so that's

01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:17,700
another property you can use the has

01:47:15,870 --> 01:47:20,010
error it does it have that particular

01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:22,110
error co-state delivery if though yes if

01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:24,870
not just show the normal stuff right

01:47:22,110 --> 01:47:26,610
again I know we're running out of time

01:47:24,870 --> 01:47:27,930
so we're we have we have just like 2

01:47:26,610 --> 01:47:29,580
minutes we're probably not gonna have

01:47:27,930 --> 01:47:32,460
time for questions but you're in Kachin

01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:34,050
catarina myself outside now it's been

01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:36,270
two hours and we hope that we've been

01:47:34,050 --> 01:47:37,950
able to give you something there's so

01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:39,840
much about reactive forms we haven't

01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:42,330
talked about it's a huge huge huge thing

01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,770
I'll be doing you injustice by said in

01:47:42,330 --> 01:47:46,710
two hours we can get past everything

01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:48,300
that's that's a lie but by by doing the

01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:50,430
two hours we've given you over we hope

01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:52,920
we've been able to at least show you

01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:54,200
some possibilities and that you can go

01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:57,060
