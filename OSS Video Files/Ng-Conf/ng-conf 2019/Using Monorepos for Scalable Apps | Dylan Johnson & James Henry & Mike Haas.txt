Title: Using Monorepos for Scalable Apps | Dylan Johnson & James Henry & Mike Haas
Publication date: 2019-05-07
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	This interactive workshop will explore an architecture for building a large Angular app across federated development teams.

We’ll cover some low-level specifics of the architecture, like an Elements-based approach to angular.js migration, and building a shared component library on top of the Angular CDK. From there, we’ll explore developer experience and delivery ergonomics items like source control in a monorepo, Continuous Integration strategies, and code generation and modification via Schematics.

Interactive examples will be provided, but laptops aren’t required to consume the workshop content.

ng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.
