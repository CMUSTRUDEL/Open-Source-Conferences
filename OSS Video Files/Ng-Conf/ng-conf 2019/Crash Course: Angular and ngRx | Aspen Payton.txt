Title: Crash Course: Angular and ngRx | Aspen Payton
Publication date: 2019-05-04
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	This is a hands-on workshop that teaches participants how to structure an Angular application to use NgRx for state management. When I set out to learn NgRx a year ago, I found a lot of high level discussion of the Redux pattern and a variety of very specific code examples, but struggled to find education that laid out the pattern from beginning to end with fully functional examples. That is what I intend to provide with this workshop.

We will being with a starter project and existing HTML. We will set up state for the application, walk through creating a basic action and reducer, wire up the action and reducer in our app, and dispatch the action from a component so we can see it working in the app. From here, we can walk through the pattern again introducing additional complexity by passing a payload into an action and creating an action with an effect. Participants will end the workshop with a simple, but fully functional, application using NgRx.
