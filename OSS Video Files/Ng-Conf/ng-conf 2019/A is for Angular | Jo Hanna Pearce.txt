Description: 
	The Angular system continues to grow 
It’s hard to keep track of the things we should know

Sometimes it’s helpful to tell as a story
Our journey from Earth to Angular Centauri

So I’ll start at the start, with A and then B
With so many sights, oh the things we will see!

After reaching the end with a stop for each letter
Our map of it all will be bigger and better!
