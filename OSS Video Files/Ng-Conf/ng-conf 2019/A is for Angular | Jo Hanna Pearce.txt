Description: 
	The Angular system continues to grow 
It’s hard to keep track of the things we should know

Sometimes it’s helpful to tell as a story
Our journey from Earth to Angular Centauri

So I’ll start at the start, with A and then B
With so many sights, oh the things we will see!

After reaching the end with a stop for each letter
Our map of it all will be bigger and better!

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:19,529
hi ng-conf you ready for something

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:21,689
slightly different yeah okay it's

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:22,920
regular the reason we're here there's

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,180
quite a lot to it not all of it clear

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,010
what I'm going to attempt is poetic

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,900
oration of angular aspects that cause

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,400
consternation there's so much to say and

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,240
I haven't much time I've got 26 letters

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,239
to get through and Ryan

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,710
B is for browser for which we all build

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,300
there isn't just one we may need

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,380
polyfills we test different systems as

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,840
much as we're able so it's not to

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,579
exclude anyone from our table see

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,350
succour where we find content child

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,399
compiler as well which each module

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,200
provides common we need as the

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,140
maintenance adjust and component fixture

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,390
with which we write tests D is for

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,250
decorators what are they for

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,260
they make classes and methods and

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,360
properties do more how do we add such

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,379
syntactical sweetness they're just

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,920
functions that bring some grammatical

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:04,080
neatness ease for elements exciting a

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,700
new portable angular components for you

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,170
not only easier to load on the fly but

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,760
standards-compliant they're consumable

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,740
by the other big frameworks even plain

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,159
JavaScript they'll be fun getting future

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,780
big projects to shipped fsor formats and

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,970
factories and forms driven by templates

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,020
or is reactive the norm this is one of

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,220
those areas where preference feels

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,950
muddled and it seems like it could leave

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,259
developers troubled under G we find

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,000
guards and some methods that get from

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,530
potato our roots to locale date format

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,729
the methods are more or less simple

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,079
enough but explaining the Rueter and

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,369
guards be tough with the time rushing on

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,640
what I won't even try if I have to use

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,890
more sketchy rhymes I might cry H is for

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,030
HTTP and our host hypertext transport is

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,409
something that most of the devs in this

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,509
room will probably get but you may not

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,829
have used the host decorator yet it

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,060
tells the injector just where it should

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,420
cease as it tries to acquire what it

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,369
needs piece point piece eyes for IV or

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,560
renderer three simpler and faster and

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,880
small as a flea all that's the intention

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,149
it's not quite yet done but it's out

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,799
that a try if you want to have fun J

00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,960
brings us onto JIT compiler Factory

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,189
about which the docks are quite

00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,360
unsatisfactory there's Jason pipe to

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,340
which I'm sure we've all used but as

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,630
it's impure it should not be abused it's

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,799
great for debugging seeing under the

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,489
skin of components we writes in the

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,900
properties within KS for key values used

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,860
in the map for detecting the changes

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,420
throughout our app

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,950
has left many devs feeling hopelessly

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,910
wrecked as they look up expression

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,140
changed after it has been checked

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,670
Ellis location the way we might tell the

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,200
parts of a rap from each URL the

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,400
strategies changes how the address of

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,420
our pages will look and whether the mess

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,710
with its readable straight forward

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,220
slashes and slugs well instead of all

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:34,800
that be just hashes and bugs M is for

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,970
modules and messages and MUX while

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,080
module is one of the main building

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,790
blocks the message bus may not be

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,770
something you found it sends data

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,600
between the UI and background while the

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,870
web worker code isn't ready just yet its

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,770
importance will grow in the future I bet

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,120
navigation is next in the no errors

00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,980
scheme and of course all the classes

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,450
beginning ng star who'd have thought

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,680
that the devs of a modern creation would

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,890
succumb to the need for Hungarian

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,420
notation

00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,160
onwards to overrunning it on destroy the

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,570
decorators optional an output don't joy

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,890
there's nothing that seems unfamiliar

00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,640
here just parts of the system that we

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,290
hold near and dear P is for plural a

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,610
curious thing if you look up the rules

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,020
for outputting strings but locales who

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,600
users might reasonably expect the

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,860
Unicode cldr has the specs I don't

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,930
recommend it for a bit of light bedtime

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,470
read but for localization is a doc you

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,060
should heed Q is for querying all of the

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,380
things we can query of the types so

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,299
query with strings we can query the

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,630
content query the view and be sure we're

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:29,610
updated of anything new to observe all

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,900
the things we need rxjs and there's more

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,280
to this lib for some dots might suggest

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,570
if you're struggling the state and try

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,220
and gr X you'll learn more of its

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,330
breadth in it first be perplexed how you

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,739
ever could limit yourself to

00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,560
subscriptions that ended with only a

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,510
single omission with s we might like to

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,950
consider schematics for workflow

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,269
improvements they could be dramatic but

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,010
only if what we are hoping to gain is a

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,840
better approach to the code we maintain

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,459
pragmatically projects that stay fairly

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,700
small may not ever lead to semantics at

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,530
all T's de typescript not as hard as you

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,269
thought other lately it seems there's a

00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,650
war being fought between those of us

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:00,090
pleased with their explicit typing and

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,010
others who seem to be constantly sniping

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,200
that JavaScript really was made to be

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,769
free and guessing what everything does

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,769
is the key

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,110
you brings the upgrade module inter-site

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,489
and I honestly can't recommend that you

00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,260
fight with the hybridization of angular

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:15,819
apps separate them by route don't fall

00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,350
into the traps of thinking but as this

00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:19,540
is something we could that means that

00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,829
it's one of the things that we should if

00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,000
he brings a strand of you child who your

00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,530
children be content or F and you've

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,400
encapsulation I really can't fit into

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,570
here what they do but note the

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,620
distinction between content and view

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,180
there's a Dom for the things that we

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,270
view on the screen and another for

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,680
content that sets up the scenes W brings

00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,530
us to classes that look as though they

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,730
all start with the phrase what the the

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,380
intent here is not just to make you all

00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,970
smirk WTF stands for web tracing

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,410
framework if performance is key this may

00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,889
be what you're using but for everyone

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,030
else we see code that's amusing xsr xhr

00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,080
Factory and well what else is there

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,030
under this letter to tell they've

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,030
wrapped xml httprequest it's one of the

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,250
things that allows us to test why is for

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,570
you all the people here seated who

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,790
wrestled with code and remain undefeated

00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,770
community is something that makes us all

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:03,580
better and frankly there's nothing that

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:05,110
starts with this letter Z is for Zones

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,400
about which all I'll say is I'm hoping

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,720
we no longer need them one day and that

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,070
little thought is the last thing I'll

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,540
mention I'm grateful you've lasted the

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,220
course paid attention I've rushed

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,630
through a lot in a very short time and I

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,630
think now I've used all my angular

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:21,360
rhymes thank you

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:23,419
[Applause]

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,419
you
