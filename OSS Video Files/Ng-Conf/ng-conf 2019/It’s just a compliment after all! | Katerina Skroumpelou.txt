Title: It’s just a compliment after all! | Katerina Skroumpelou
Publication date: 2019-05-07
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	Some compliments just don’t work. Being a woman in tech highlights this phenomenon in sometimes cringe-worthy ways. And in some cases, certain “compliments” are just inappropriate. So how do we make friendships and set the right tone for compliments? I will talk about ways to do this in a professional setting, where both the person sending the compliment and the person receiving the compliment get the benefit of the spirit in which the compliment was intended. You’ll be able apply these ideas to anyone you work with, not just women.

ng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.

00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:19,949
hi I'm Katarina and my talk today's is

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:21,600
just a compliment after all so as we

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,910
said I'm a software engineer this dot

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,279
I'm also a Google developer expert for

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,650
angular and web technologies I'm the

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,590
founder of angler Athens the younger

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,899
meetup in Athens in Greece I help the

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,989
community a mentor I love cats

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:40,770
chocolates and also I go to a lot of

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:43,559
conferences at the last large convention

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,930
was out in January person walked up to

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,590
me and asked me are you the speakers

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,719
girlfriend

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,610
I laughed on the inside because I

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,489
thought it's just the most difficult

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,680
mistake somebody can make assume that a

00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:00,210
woman is a company in her techy

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,969
boyfriend husband whatever I said no he

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,790
apologized he clearly felt very very bad

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,610
about it I joked I said ok I won't

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:13,729
report you but it's ok he was a nice

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,729
person he felt bad isn't enough right

00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,740
however back in December 2018

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,909
I had another experience I was at a

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:27,330
conference and I gave a talk and after

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,549
finished talking I checked my Twitter to

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,590
see the usual impact of my talk like the

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,110
direct messages the retweets the photos

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,240
I also checked my direct messages as I

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,460
said and I had received a message that

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,439
said you're too pretty to the talk I

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,030
can't focus on lighthouse lighthouse was

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:50,159
the topic of my talk so today what we're

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:52,860
going to talk about is compliments so

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,439
we're not going I'm not going to be

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,540
sharing fancy statistics about PEG ups

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,509
and these things I might do this in

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,070
another talk I'm going to focus on what

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:07,170
is appropriate and what is not in the

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:09,360
workplace and while men can experience

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,580
and do experience microaggressions in

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,290
their workplace it's something in the

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,329
way that women experience

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,420
aggressions that helps highlight the

00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:20,310
need to understand them better so this

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,510
is one this is what we're going to do

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,799
today I'm going to share some examples

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:27,689
with you to help illustrate that so back

00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:29,459
to that two error message in December

00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,950
you're too pretty to do the talk I can't

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:36,680
focus on the topic just a compliment

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:41,310
right well in settings where my

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:45,180
appearance is not relevant to what the

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,670
top to the setting it's quite a

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,419
problematic to focus on something like

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,010
that if that was a beauty contest than

00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:57,840
my appearance would be much more

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:59,970
relevant back in the earlier stages of

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,790
my career when I would receive a

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,230
compliment like that somebody focusing

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,769
on something irrelevant to my actual

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:10,590
work I would feel insecure I would think

00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:12,239
that is this person implying that I'm

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,430
not good enough my work is not good

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,780
enough and they're just focusing on the

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,049
woman that is on stage

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,569
are they implying that the very fact

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:25,409
that them there is impressive so they

00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:29,909
might just as well focus instead of my

00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:32,370
actual work now that a more experienced

00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,409
and I've been in the sector for longer I

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:38,099
know that these comments are not

00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:40,620
reflective of my actual work so what I

00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,479
instead think is that maybe I should

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:57,900
take my brain cells where since I may

00:03:42,479 --> 00:04:00,419
not be welcome here actually is that

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,879
this person focus on my appearance just

00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:05,519
illustrates to me that they are not

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,970
accustomed to the presence of women in a

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,489
workplace

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,769
it just shows their lack of professional

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,750
experience and not enough exposure to a

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:17,820
working environment where women are

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:20,190
presence I can of course take

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,370
compliments and I won't react badly if

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:25,500
you ever compliment me and for example I

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,990
will show you some other examples of

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,300
complim

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,430
I received them that day and I reacted

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,319
with the normal excitement that you get

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,870
when somebody receives a compliment

00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:39,729
for example a thermos has said full

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:42,280
house or my talk or my talk is grade it

00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:44,770
works in so many levels I teach and work

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,490
to keep the audience engaged with my

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,599
work and my content is good I obviously

00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,639
know my stuff

00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:54,340
my presentation style is effective so

00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,190
there is no way that somebody cannot

00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:00,509
focus on the work right and also there

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:04,240
is a full house on my talk for example

00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:06,159
of course it's not only compliments I

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,630
can take I can say constructive feedback

00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:13,330
as well and comments for example one of

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:15,159
the the most valuable comments that an

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,009
feedback somebody gave to me on that

00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:20,169
specific day was you should maybe record

00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:22,030
your demos so that you don't get stuck

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:25,030
on slow internet and just wait there

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,340
impatiently or you could take that

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,900
specific thing on your slides and make

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:40,360
it a bit clearer so that people

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:42,460
understand what I mean to say is that in

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,949
a professional setting where the focus

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,990
should be in work we should just be

00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:50,590
mindful when complimenting someone on

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:53,229
their looks because someone's appearance

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,780
has nothing to do with the reason why

00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:57,639
they're there for example you have come

00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,830
to this conference you have paid a ton

00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,469
of money to be here you have paid a ton

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:06,340
of money and time to listen to experts

00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:09,280
like like our speakers and meet other

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:12,219
people to connect and really learn new

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,800
things so you just spoiled the reason

00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:16,990
you're here if you're not focusing on

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,159
the content or connecting with people to

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:22,990
talk about the content of course friends

00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:28,389
and work friends can give compliments

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:31,060
and we know that such compliments will

00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,779
come from positive in sense because

00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,760
Trust has been built already in

00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:38,830
relationships that exist unfortunately

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,520
there is also a category of compliments

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,440
that

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,539
from negative incense and these are

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,330
called the backhanded or couvert

00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:48,129
compliments when this happens the

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,009
impression you leave is that you want to

00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:53,349
slide someone or to covertly tell

00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:56,440
someone that their job is just not good

00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:58,090
enough or that as a woman the very fact

00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,770
that you're here is so impressive so

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,190
there's nothing else to compliment

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:07,120
you're saying you're too pretty to be

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:10,330
here is just as backhanded a saying whoa

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:15,569
for a gear to fun and I'm sure some of

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,569
us have heard that compliments as well

00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,659
if you're sitting there wondering why

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,880
I'm so concerned about receiving that

00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:28,090
misplaced compliment back in December

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,069
please let me remind you that this is

00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,449
not the only thing that I have heard you

00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:34,210
know this years that I'm in this sector

00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:36,909
I have heard and experienced of all

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:39,009
things in my workplaces that were not

00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:41,440
even regarded as problematic in their

00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:44,020
settings by anyone else involved but me

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,819
I want to share a few personal examples

00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,810
with you in the hopes that it will

00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:52,030
create some empathy within the audience

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,550
so I usually I'm the only female group

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,919
in a male of developers so my first job

00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,830
no one ever asked me anything

00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:02,050
all questions would go right around me

00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,210
no matter how close they were to the

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,120
person asking the question no matter how

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:10,180
difficult and filled with challenges and

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:15,610
Dragons the road so that other colleague

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:17,610
was I would just be invisible also I was

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,440
the only person writing JavaScript right

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,449
the main topic of conversation was how

00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,449
javascript is like the worst language

00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:26,949
ever how everybody hates JavaScript how

00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,659
it's not developers that write

00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:30,819
JavaScript I don't know if you've heard

00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:33,820
it from people who don't read JavaScript

00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:38,829
but I think it's a very common joke so

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:41,550
yeah it was it wasn't directed to me but

00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:43,990
still it offended me in some way right

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:46,060
also it was the only person running

00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,149
Ubuntu the others had more sophisticated

00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:52,010
Linux distributions Ubuntu was for

00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:55,370
housewives yeah

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:58,490
these things went totally unnoticed as

00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:01,580
most as things go but I believe that

00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,610
such things looking down on the woman

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:08,440
colleague not taking her seriously will

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:12,850
create a in environments where buttock

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,899
bad behavior is accepted and tolerated

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,740
when we're not mindful of the

00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:21,020
environment we are creating and yes even

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:24,649
compliments that are backhanded like the

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:27,920
ones I shared before can create a

00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:30,140
hostile environment as an example in

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,810
that same job I also had a stalker who I

00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,990
ended up threatening with the police I'm

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:38,480
not saying that the disrespectful

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,010
comments and jokes led to that stalker

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,410
stalking me I'm not saying that at all

00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,870
I'm just saying that little by little

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:48,620
little disrespectful behavior here

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:50,959
little jokes there will create will

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,450
aggregate together and can potentially

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:58,370
create an environment where even worse

00:09:53,450 --> 00:10:00,350
behaviors are accepted in in a study by

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:05,060
the Australian Government on violence

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:07,810
against women they say that's not okay

00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,810
let me get this right

00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:14,990
not all disrespectful behavior towards

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:17,330
women leads to violence but all violence

00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,940
against women starts with a little bit

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,620
of disrespectful behavior so we should

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,040
keep that in mind I'm not saying that

00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:27,440
I'm there yet I'm I'm likely far away

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,910
from there but just be mindful the

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,080
environment we collectively create

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:35,329
together really matters another example

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,300
of a covert compliment is isolating

00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:40,910
someone and making them the exception in

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,980
one of my other jobs again I was the

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:45,890
only woman in a group of male developers

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,930
and I was treated more nicely but I had

00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,360
this colleague who would say Katerina

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,550
you're the exception usually women are

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,410
better in the household they're good in

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,570
household chores I'm not saying that

00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,399
what you're doing is bad is the I'm not

00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,650
saying that your work is not good I'm

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,740
just saying that women more naturally

00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:05,089
belong in the household I recognized

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,540
that he believed he was voicing a

00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:08,750
comment

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,399
leaf saying that out saying that I'm an

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:15,320
exception but the rest of the women

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:17,839
would thrive in the household is just

00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,910
saying that woman's not biologically

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:28,220
belong in the tech sector right that

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:29,779
it's a man's job so he would say you're

00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,550
an exception you're super good and

00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:33,649
computers the stuff generally women

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:38,360
biologically do better in household

00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:39,980
things again I I want to believe in his

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,750
good intentions I want to believe that

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,579
he wanted to say that wow you're an

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:47,389
exception you're too good for a woman

00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:49,550
but again she could choose to compliment

00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:51,440
me in some other way like some other of

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:55,100
my colleagues did like terena you did a

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,220
good job in this front end task that you

00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:01,490
had or I liked your documentation there

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:05,600
just be more specific and not just wow

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:08,269
you're good for a woman I also had some

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,860
mums planers in my jobs I know if you

00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:13,010
know the definition of mansplain let's

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,089
eat it's a verb of a man to explain

00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,550
something to someone

00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:20,680
typically a woman in a manner regarded

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:24,139
as condescending or patronizing so

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:26,930
another one's plainer at that job told

00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:30,410
me well it's no coincidence that all

00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:32,630
great scientists are men right we get

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,690
that a lot and we're thinking inside us

00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:41,180
don't mention Marie Curie is and as an

00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:43,569
auntie example you know so there does

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,550
history down the drain right because

00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:49,760
even though things are good for women

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:52,250
now we still have to pay we still have

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:57,500
to deal with pagans discriminatory

00:12:52,250 --> 00:13:01,339
hiring and what he was saying is that

00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,259
and again we also have to deal with such

00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:05,149
colleagues that tell us that women

00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:07,870
thrive in the household with the

00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:13,189
exception of Marie Curie and I

00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:15,790
apparently in a tech community I am part

00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:15,790
of in Athens

00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:22,160
a person told that feminism belongs in

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,630
the sixes there's no inequality today

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,259
there's nothing to complain about

00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:29,300
anyone ever everything is fine and

00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:33,740
whoever thinks the opposite is just

00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:37,040
lingered funnily enough in very recent

00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:39,019
research in 2018 by the cognitive

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,600
development lab of the University of

00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:43,759
Illinois the researchers found evidence

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,529
of consistent bias against women and

00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,319
girls in contexts that emphasize

00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:51,050
intellectual ability in other words each

00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:57,649
amount stop I promise that will not so

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:59,870
pay gaps okay so we all have to work we

00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:02,839
all know that we have to work equally

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,519
hard to provide you get promoted get a

00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,160
pay rise gain respect from our

00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:10,610
co-workers and those above us but

00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,519
sometimes a woman has first to prove

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:16,730
herself that she's worthy of her seat in

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,949
that office next to you look you're

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,560
going to work with more women and more

00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:23,630
minorities in tech it's a fact the world

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,730
is becoming more and more diverse I

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:29,300
share these stories with you in the

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:31,819
hopes that we can learn how to deal with

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,589
the situations and how to act more

00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:37,040
normally and in a way that is more

00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:40,430
inclusive so right now I happen to work

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,949
at a company where there are more women

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,569
and women no leadership no less I'm not

00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:47,449
saying that things are perfect just

00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:50,240
because of that but luckily I can just

00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:52,370
focus on my JIRA tickets and not have to

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,589
worry about if I get an inappropriate

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,079
looks inappropriate disrespectful

00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:59,930
comments or disrespectful jokes about my

00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:03,500
womanhood of course we still have to

00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:06,170
work hard on having we still have to

00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,480
work hard to make sure that we're okay

00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:12,009
with each other and I'm sure we all

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,819
still have unconscious biases sorry I

00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:15,819
have my notes here

00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:31,069
but the best the most important thing is

00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:33,469
that it's all about exposure so men that

00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:35,389
are working in this company are more

00:15:33,469 --> 00:15:39,349
exposed to more women in their workplace

00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:41,539
and this helps them feel that it's more

00:15:39,349 --> 00:15:44,959
normal remember back in the beginning I

00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:48,619
talks about how such an appropriate

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,089
comments show a lack of exposure and

00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:53,089
experience with working with women

00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:56,059
working with more women makes things

00:15:53,089 --> 00:16:00,819
more natural and actually you don't have

00:15:56,059 --> 00:16:00,819
to actually try and do something else

00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:07,819
another study showed that's long-term by

00:16:05,989 --> 00:16:09,829
the department psychology University of

00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:11,629
Massachusetts showed the long-term

00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:14,089
effect of social environments on

00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:16,669
automatic gender stereotyping was

00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:18,769
mediated by the frequency of exposure to

00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:23,479
women leaders so it's backed up by

00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:24,709
research right so the combining work for

00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:26,419
is the stories you know

00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:28,189
so it's forty eight percent females six

00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:30,079
more percent underrepresented ethnic

00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:31,970
groups it's such a new experience for me

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,579
and I guess it's such a new experience

00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:38,949
for men who work there too because in

00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:42,589
the u.s. 25 percent most companies have

00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:47,029
twenty five percent women in tech groups

00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:49,339
so still the rate is a lot different

00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:50,839
another type of complements is a blanket

00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:52,220
compliment which I'm not saying this bad

00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,019
I'm just saying that it's not

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,649
constructive so what is a blanket

00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:59,119
compliment abundant compliment is

00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:02,599
selling something that is not very

00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:04,939
specific so it's not very helpful when

00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:06,889
do we tend to use blanket compliments we

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:09,860
tend to use blanket compliments when we

00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:12,829
want to make someone feel accepted but

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:15,019
we don't know exactly the way to treat

00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:17,149
them and actually tell them what was

00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:22,339
good about what they did you're doing

00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:25,699
great can sound like hang in there what

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:28,549
we can do is let's just all be a bit

00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:30,789
more constructive let's add a specific

00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:32,270
commentary on our actual work

00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:34,460
constructive comments

00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:36,890
like great job on that presentation

00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,500
great job on explaining that thing

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,170
specifically or feedback and comments

00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,270
can really show care and respect which

00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,460
is the thing you want to express when

00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,910
you're giving a comments in an or a

00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:54,770
compliment in any case when giving a

00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:58,160
compliment as women are usually assumed

00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:01,250
to to respond with just a smile and a

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,910
nod oh he said just a compliment just

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:07,040
take it it's okay you know well now you

00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:10,820
know why I believe this behavior is a

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,650
bit problematic and why this needs to be

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,090
changed so that we create better

00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:20,270
environments and more inclusive

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:22,340
environments for all people and I also

00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:25,460
want to say let's complement some more

00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:28,460
because complimenting people will create

00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:30,680
a virtuous circle of positive

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,040
communication that will benefit all and

00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,740
make people feel more welcome remember

00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,000
back in slide 14 I'm sure you didn't

00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,130
count the slides but it was in the

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,420
beginning where I talked about

00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,520
insecurity and whether I feel welcome

00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:46,250
well the reason I'm here today is that

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,440
the angular community has actually

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,840
helped me feel confident and accepted by

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,710
given constructive comments constructive

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:58,030
feedback constructive compliments and

00:18:53,710 --> 00:19:01,040
creating a whole family of acceptance so

00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:02,540
please next time if you think of

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,820
complimenting a woman in a professional

00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,890
setting try to think of a compliment

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:10,220
relevant to the situation and first of

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:12,410
all build trust because that woman just

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,850
like you has worked really hard to be

00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,850
here that's it

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,220
you

00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:30,650
