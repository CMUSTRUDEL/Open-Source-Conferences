anti-patterns uh my name is Reid

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,699
villainy I'm a developer here at a rebug

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,140
software it's a Buick software is a

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,080
learning rich environments where we're

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,240
all encouraged to pursue things such as

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,070
talking in front of let's see once about

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,980

well whatever here for you so I would

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,989
say this talk is all about protection no

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,320
no it's about job security no no even

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,550
better

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,649
it's about career immortality alright so

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,910
I'll be P pretty much preaching to the

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,020
choir here right and it's gonna be

00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,859

so a little Oscar he's a sentient alien

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,200
emoji that lives inside my computer

00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,460
that's pretty convenient right right

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,890
around the time we had a space-themed

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,390
conference that nice so uh little Oscar

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,619
you know we're gonna we're gonna talk to

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,250
these folks about some in Jaques

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,500
anti-patterns what do you mean they're

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,520
in Florida now I mean you getting ready

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,770
to call me out in front of 1500 people

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,110
yeah yeah you heard me

00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:48,119
1500 jeez oh no I see what's going on

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,579
here look he can't see all cuz the

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,750
cameras pointed at me but he can huge

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,040
the microphone right so come on

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,950
everybody show them that you hear let's

00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,619
make some noise all right yeah

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,290
oh all right no pressure man

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:05,580
anyway we're here to talk about ng rx

00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,630
solo Oscar can you tell these folks out

00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,030
here a little bit about this technology

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,600
oh you got it you got it okay good well

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,580
all right go ahead lay it on this oh

00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,970
come on you know it's calm down here man

00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:20,130
cheese but ultimately I guess we don't

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,989
really have time to go over all of ng rx

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,269
so uh it's kind of hard to see you guys

00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:28,230
so show of hands how many of you use in

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,430
grx on a daily basis okay so it's that's

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,050
less than half you know that's all right

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,330
that's all right because what I'm gonna

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,160
do here is for any in grx related things

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,319
I'm just gonna give a good ten thousand

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,390
foot view and hopefully later on when

00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:43,080
you are using ng rx on your day to day

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,670
you'll kind of you know recognize some

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,860
of these opportunities I'm about to

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,080
present to you here right so you know I

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,040
mean speaking of that I mean it guys

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,480
it's time to stop beating around the

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,769
bush right I mean you've all read the

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,910
description of this talk haven't you I

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:55,830
mean and you're all here at ng-conf

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,630
right so it means you're the best of the

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,090
best right and as the best of the best

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,000
day you guys know that uh in grx

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,329
it's made our lives absolutely

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,880
positively miserable right oh man I mean

00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:11,190
heck in the world of PR reviews and

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,380
opinionated frameworks man confusing

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,450
stakes ma the very last things we had or

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,709
to make sure not replaced by any regular

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,040
land your developer off the street and

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:23,670
like what what well what's the matter a

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,380
little Oscar what do you mean I told you

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,640
and do this anymore I'm just kind of

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,200
building rapport with the audience here

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,060
right now we all know that it's a

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,760
dog-eat-dog world out there and the only

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,130
way to survive is to pretty much oh come

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,739
on that's just rude call me out and

00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,660
making me look bad for the thing even

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,269
starts and by the way when did I say

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,230
anything about a team keep it to

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,470
yourself man this guy am i right people

00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,769
anyway

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,769
know your enemy in grx and what it

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:54,030
brings to the table so uh lil Oscar can

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,280
you tell us what in your ex brings to

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,139
the table no you give me this on

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,540
treatment nice okay fine I'll just do it

00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:01,799
myself in so yeah all right so um

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,970
there's actually just three little

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,080
points I wanted to make here right so

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,280
three little points I'm just going to

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,269
list them out here and we'll kind of go

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,220
over them one by one

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:09,300
a little better as we

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,580
progress through this here right so

00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,640
point number one it uses opinionated to

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,380
recognize patterns number two it enables

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,480
easyshare ability between components and

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,340
of course it uses the power and

00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,740
flexibility of rxjs and the state

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,660
management right so now we know we're

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,350
fighting right so uh what are we gonna

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,240
do about it

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,000
well as you know the best way to defeat

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:34,950
your enemies is to utilize your allies

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,590
oh the antipatterns so uh hey little

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,630
Oscar I'm sorry about before man right I

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,490
mean look I need you here man I can't do

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,870
this without you come on oh yeah how are

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,150
you get out Riku Leonor we got it ah

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,580
good ok there's my little buddy well

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,840
alright I'll ask her so uh what do you

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,360
think in why don't people like the fact

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,450
that our XJS uses opinionated recognize

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,130
patterns oh they could be confident and

00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,690
rely on established patterns all right I

00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,070
mean I could see why I would make people

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,130
happy but how is that gonna help on

00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,510
their day to day oh ok they'll know

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,950
exactly where stuff is without even

00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,110
looking well I mean I guess that makes

00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,730
sense I mean on projects I've been on

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,350
I've noticed that project a project

00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,760
you'll see almost the same exact

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,530
patterns right and I've even seen

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,470
patterns persist between completely

00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,330
separate companies and well that's a

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:22,020
pain right so how are we gonna do how

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,790
are we going to defeat that well what

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,950
we're gonna do is we're going to use ng

00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,320
rx effects excessively yeah that's right

00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,580
ngrick effects in grx

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,530
effects you know it's a library

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,600
typically used for handling stuff like

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,430
side effects it's powerful though they

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,810
can do way more than handle side effects

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,370
right so that's why if we do things

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,800
outside of the scope of side-effects

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,780
then no one will have any idea where

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,160
anything is at all right so let me kind

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,740
of we kind of show you what I'm talking

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,540
about here right so um what we're

00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,600
looking at here is a typical example of

00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,520
derived state which basically means that

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,919
uh we're getting data that we don't

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,750
really store on the state object but we

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,430
can determine it through we do store

00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,790
which in the case of this snippet here

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,800
is all the enemy all the entities in

00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,600
memory as well as the currently selected

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,770
ID with the ID being something like a

00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,830
UUID string you know a number whatever

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:15,030
so yeah so we're looking at this snippet

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,380
you know we're gonna so we'll see what

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,940
they did here so they're creating a

00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,890
selector right so for those of you who

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,999
don't use in grx you know a selector is

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,329
uh just a way you can kind of

00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:27,219
pluck some data out of your out of your

00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:28,629
den grx state right so they're gonna

00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:30,309
create that selector right they're gonna

00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:31,569
use actually a different selector here

00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:33,639
called select idiots that means they're

00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:35,679
gonna get all of like I said the

00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,119
customers in the memory right now and

00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:38,919
they're also going to use a separate

00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:40,929
selector called get select ID that's

00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:43,869
that that's them getting the UID or

00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:45,369
string or whatever of the customer they

00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:46,929
want to have right and then they're

00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:50,169
gonna provide this callback here right

00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:52,029
where they're gonna pretty much take the

00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:53,559
customers and select ID they're kind of

00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:56,339
provided in the arguments of the call

00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:59,469
back there and you can make it so your

00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,669
entities are keyed by their ID right so

00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:03,579
you can just simply use the square

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:04,689
bracket to to select that right so uh

00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:08,139
yeah it's

00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:09,309
that's um well those of you that users

00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:11,229
often know that this is anything special

00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:13,539
I mean this is just what you do you use

00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:15,489
selectors to get data out of your out of

00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:16,869
your state right so I'm not saying

00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:19,119
anything unusual here right

00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,799
this is memorized you've heard them

00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:22,989
buried word memorized a few times

00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:25,149
already right I mean so when you have to

00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:26,289
call this multiple times you'll find

00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:28,569
that it doesn't have to go through all

00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:29,860
this rigmarole to get this data if the

00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:32,889
state hasn't changed recently it's just

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,939
gonna use the cash value this is very

00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:36,429
terse I mean look there's not really

00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:37,599
like a whole lot of calculation going on

00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:39,849
up there or anything right well that's

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,279
handled kind of kind of in the in the

00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:44,739
background for you right and finally

00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:46,569
it's possible at a glance if you use in

00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:47,679
your ex law right we just we just read

00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:50,829
it like a book right left to right top

00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:54,159
to bottom like a book I use epz and in

00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:56,529
fact maybe a little bit too easy peasy

00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:57,699
right because hey if I have a

00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:59,919
co-worker's I can be looking at this

00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:01,360
they're gonna be like oh I like that I

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,789
can totally see what's going on here in

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,139
fact I don't even need read to tell me

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:06,159
what this thing is doing so if we leave

00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:08,829
in needham here that's what's gonna

00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:10,809
happen right so we're gonna give this a

00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:12,909
bit of a riff factor what we're gonna

00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:14,139
we're gonna tear this out of our files

00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,659
of all our selectors we're gonna throw

00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:18,249
into our effects right and we'll have

00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:21,789
what we have looks a little something

00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:25,360
like this year right ah so how shall we

00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:27,849
do this well let's just say that uh that

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,069
um this effect here what has to do is it

00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:31,659
has to sit there and wait for a select

00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,829
customer ID action right we're gonna

00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:34,419
pipe into that right we're using a

00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:35,199
switch map operator which by the way and

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,010
we're gonna talk a little more about

00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:37,390
that later right

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,860
and then we're gonna pipe into the store

00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,630
and use this okay they get by it it's

00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,530
like we're gonna pass in the action pay

00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,669
LA tonight because that's grammar die

00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,870
selector right and then this is we're

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,030
gonna then send out a customer selected

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,560
oh by the way for those of you who don't

00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:50,320
use in grx so how many of you are

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,650
following me here oh one of you okay

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,750
cool

00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,790
good good I like that because that means

00:08:52,750 --> 00:09:00,100
that us making more moving parts is

00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:02,290
working good job man not only that this

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,390
is not memorized anymore right so that

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,840
basically means if your app is starting

00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:09,190
to get a little non performant then you

00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,840
can come back here and fix this right

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:15,010
change it back to a selector and man you

00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:16,990
look awesome then don't you and like I

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,630
say this was just one example this is a

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,610
powerful library you can move lots of

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:25,060
stuff into your effects files right nope

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:26,980
when I say that when I say that your

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,260
effects files become very large an

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,640
arbitrary how what how large an

00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,600
arbitrary are we talking here right like

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,450
how big can we got effects files BAM

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,700
yeah that's what I like to see whoo huh

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,680
boy Oh a little bit of a tip for you

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,570
here if you want to reach this level of

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,820
greatness maybe try and start a little

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,810
small right only kind of people that can

00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,490
handle this kind of stuff are

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:55,870
professionals you know like me all right

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:58,810
so next up little Oscar you're you're

00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,980
exaggerating come on what do you mean

00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,780
you don't think you can do this I'm not

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,820
how shining you buy that much come on

00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,410
tell these people why anyone would want

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,380
in you know easyshare ability between

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,030
components what allows for simple data

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:13,060
synchronization utilizing the global

00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:14,470
state global state huh that doesn't

00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,440
sound too bad man that one it's like a

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:21,760
global variable right hey we call enough

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:25,060
vulture yeah still though I guess the I

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,130
guess that the in grx state is immutable

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,840
right and well not only that it's quite

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,090
changes are easily trackable via stuff

00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,420
like the Redux dev tools right so that's

00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,760
a powerful foe indeed so what's our ally

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:40,090
against this foe

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,460
well if we put our state within our

00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,350
component modules it's gonna help us

00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,300
right by this you know the way it does

00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,220
that is because if we co-locate state

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,980
and component modules make sharing

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,290
easier right

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,910
um just think about I mean just kind of

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,860
think about that right I mean you know

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,390
we we have all our actual components

00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,830
right there in their little dark corners

00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,510
holding tightly under their templates

00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,610
right they have their styles in here

00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,620
completely separate and isolated from

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,610
each other unlike our state right states

00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,260
are on its own folder it's in this

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,580
little grassy green field right so if we

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,950
kind of start to take those and pull

00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,780
them into our nice dark isolated

00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,000
component folders then that kind of

00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,770
sends a bit of a message right don't

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,870
worry I'm not just telling you simply to

00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:20,240
move folders around here I'm saying

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,580
you can totally nest here I mean I'm

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,930
sorry you can combine your component

00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,360
modules and your state modules right

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,400
think about that think about that if you

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,490
have component a needing something from

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,980
state B and state bean-eating I'm sorry

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,270
component B needing time from state a

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:39,440
you've just played your card right you

00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:40,370
create a circular dependency so next up

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,940
we go whoa

00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:48,650
a little Oscar you're in the way oh oh

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,570
I'm a monster in my booth

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,160
hey guess what that's what my HR

00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:55,000
department told me and you know what I

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,930
didn't care what they had to say either

00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,970
well all right you know what if you're

00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,450
not gonna be helpful you're gonna be

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:06,940
gone

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:08,840
eat creepy clown attack sure showed him

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,190
yeah whatever you know what you pretty

00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,190
much have to be from a completely

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:15,200
different plan to be that naive well all

00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,090
right a yes all right so we know it it's

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,920
powerful and you know what it's in our

00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:21,800
way so what are we gonna do about it

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,560
well we're always gonna use the fatemeh

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,010
operator huh so yeah you know you in the

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,490
green yeah

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,720
do you use a farm operator before right

00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,970
even you've not used the funnel operator

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,670
Brian fine right you've used a farm

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,750
right before you've not no way you know

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,630
what raise your hand raise your hand if

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,310
you use the fatemeh operator no one you

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,930
know what I bet all of you have used the

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:44,970
fatemeh operator right because that is

00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:48,269
the flavor of the month operator right

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:50,189
yeah so how many of you remember this

00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:53,160
here right this is Victor calling out

00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:54,360
what was at the time quite an over usage

00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,829
of the switch map operator y'all

00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,100
remember that right

00:12:55,829 --> 00:13:01,769
this has sort of created sort of an anti

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,000
switch map movement right and by the way

00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:04,230
Victor thanks a lot you're kind of

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,389
pulling out the rug from under me here

00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,519
man ok but you know what if this is so

00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:10,560
well known then how are we gonna get our

00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,449
swish map through our pr's right well

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,639
don't worry we have the entire community

00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:16,439
on our side for this one right that's

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,779
because whenever one final operator

00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:20,490
leaves the scene the next one comes in

00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:22,889
and right behind it right and you can

00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,959
then use that operator and your your um

00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:28,199
your PR is gonna be accepted pretty much

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,220
instantly right so wait that's great

00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:30,569
that's great all right so I mean how

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,550
does that actually help us well

00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:34,139
obviously you know if we don't use all

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,209
the operators on our tool chain you're

00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,100
on our tool set then our bugs will rise

00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:39,899
and we can come look good I come back

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,250
and saving it right and you've heard me

00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,310
say a few times that we can come back

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,139
and save our code base right look I'm

00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,970
not advocating destroying code bases

00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:49,949
here right because you guys already know

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,899
this right I mean the quality of the

00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:53,279
code base you know it's it's completely

00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,639
irrelevant compared to us looking

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,100
awesome right so so a little pop quiz

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,050
here so what's gonna happen if we change

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,529
our operator here from switch map to

00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:06,449
exhaust map well let me show you hey an

00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:07,709
action one over there okay so um there

00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:08,850
so what we got here is we've got a nice

00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:10,949
little effect file right and we've got

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,949
our switch map on there right our evil

00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:15,240
switch map and we've got a demo here

00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:16,439
that just has a bunch of names how you

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,139
like the styling of this by the way I

00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:20,579
spent so much time on that so let's just

00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,519
go ahead and type in a name here let's

00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:25,350
let's use my boss here Jesse right yeah

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,000
I think that looks good don't you think

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,879
that looks good y'all yeah I think that

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,269
looks really good so let's go ahead and

00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:36,750
now let's make that change to our target

00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:41,879
here so I guess I can actually see a

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:44,189
little better if I do this so uh H a fot

00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,290
em gotcha okay so we we made our change

00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:51,059
here and let's go ahead and try this

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:51,900
again here we go Jes and well wait a

00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,720
minute

00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:57,360
that happen yeah maybe it happen the

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,050
reason I J yes oh that's weird innit

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,660
well look

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:03,660
that happened because long story really

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,010
short here switch map cares about the

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,360
earth like the latest thing you type

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,030
that is it cares about so much it

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,470
actually cancels out any any pending

00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,330
requests right that's the reason why it

00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,700
glitched programs out the exhaust map

00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,650
only cares about the earlier things you

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:22,140
did so the only thing that our input got

00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:23,580
there was just the J I definitely

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,990
recommend looking this stuff up here

00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,340
main knowledge is power right I mean you

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,370
want to use all your tool sets look if

00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:31,230
these rxjs guys can can use all that all

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,990
the tools and their toolset then so can

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,910
we right oh and by the way speaking of

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:39,090
Brian I highly recommend looking up his

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:41,250
presentation called mastering the

00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,600
operators that's on the on our YouTube

00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,600
channel it's some good stuff you know

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:50,040
kind of get you uh get you to some stuff

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,540
that you need here right so you know

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,790
what I guess if we cover pretty much all

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,410
three things here didn't--we huh I'll

00:15:53,790 --> 00:16:00,690
tell you what though it sure is lonely

00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:02,880
up here by myself Lou Oscar hi little

00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:04,530
Oscar hey you know what I'm sorry about

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,450
what I was saying before and you know

00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,310
what it's alright because what if I told

00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,290
you what if I told you right that we're

00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,480
actually secretly sending a positive

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,350
message here right by using reverse

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,630
psychology

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:20,940
yeah we've been using reverse psychology

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:22,560
this entire time so anyway yeah yeah

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,120
obviously I'm playing a character here

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,200
right

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,900
please don't actually use these things

00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,980
in production okay you know I figured

00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,720
this is a good way to kind of just

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,300
simply raise awareness and sort of a

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,410
different way of thinking right but it's

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,750
also really important to note too that

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,520
if you see folks using anti patterns

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,040
they're not being evil they're not being

00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,810
malicious right they're just they just

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,920
some lot of times they just don't know

00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,570
any better they've never been told any

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,180
better right and I've seen all of these

00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,890
here in Stack Overflow I've seen them in

00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,540
Stack Overflow right so I mean you saw

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,120
how many hands didn't go up when I said

00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,920
how many of you using our xjn grx right

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,900
so just keep that in mind and now

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,790
hopefully you know with with the

00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,930
knowledge you gained about anti-patterns

00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,920
and what you lose by using them then

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,860
maybe then you can kind of give them

00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,720
their little little moment right so uh

00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,370
yeah make a little few little call-outs

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,330
here so this entire thing was actually

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:17,580
uh was a sort of inspired by CGP crazed

00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:18,690
seven ways to maximize misery has

00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,340
absolutely nothing to do with

00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,240
programming I just really like cgp grace

00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:24,330
I just thought I'd give him a call out

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,340
here right if you liked these these

00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:30,090
little backgrounds I'm using uh the way

00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:31,500
I have a co-worker called a John Rishta

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,990
and that dude is a genius man he's a

00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,460
genius in both programming and Astro

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,100
photography and this that's good stuff

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,650
right and finally I just wanted to thank

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,320
Brian here for for letting me copy and

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:46,680
paste his entire article and uh you know

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,140
a little Oscars a little spiel there and

00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,560
uh yeah that's pretty much all I got for

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:56,109
