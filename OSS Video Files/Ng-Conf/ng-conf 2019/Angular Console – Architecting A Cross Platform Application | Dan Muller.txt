Description: 
	Angular Console is now launched as a standalone electron app as well as a Visual studio code extension. In the future it will also be released as a IDEA extension as well and maybe other platforms in the future. Would you believe it if I told you that the code difference between angular console on two different platforms is 200 lines? And that all platform releases are Angular CLI apps?! How is that even possible?! In this talk I will go over architecture decisions which allows angular console specifically to target multiple platforms with as minimal overhead and code duplication as is possible.
