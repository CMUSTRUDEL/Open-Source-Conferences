Publication date: 2019-05-07
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	We want it all: CMS-driven sites, with personalized content, without sacrificing load performance. But if youâ€™ve tried to accomplish all three with an Angular app, you may have concluded that the required request-time computation for such experiences is fundamentally at odds with a high-performance site. In this talk, Jeff Cross will show proven techniques used by Nrwl to enable super-fast, highly-dynamic websites by employing a mix of technical tactics and design constraints.

ng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.
