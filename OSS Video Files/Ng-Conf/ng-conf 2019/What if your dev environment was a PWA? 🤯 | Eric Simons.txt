Title: What if your dev environment was a PWA? ðŸ¤¯ | Eric Simons
Publication date: 2019-05-02
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	As PWAs continue to eat the marketshare for native apps, thereâ€™s still one area they havenâ€™t put a dent in: dev tools. In this talk weâ€™ll be unveiling a new suite of technologies weâ€™ve been working on that brings your local dev env fully into your browser.

ng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.

00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:18,180
hey everyone how's it going I'm Eric I'm

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,260
the co-founder of stacked lits

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,609
whoo you're okay I was gonna ask how

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,740
many people here have heard of stack

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,240
flinch I may be a raise of hands I think

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,769
that was maybe yeah it's like okay

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,119
that's a lot of people a lot more than

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,030
last year we thought that maybe people

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,800
knew about us last year um for those of

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,809
you who have not heard of stack blitz

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,420
we're an online IDE

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,129
that makes building web apps like easy

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,920
mode it's just a total dream two years

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,660
if you've ever used the angular Docs and

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,390
hit run live example and you get this

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,739
nice awesome IDE in your browser that's

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,239
our stuff so maybe you've used it

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:56,219
without realizing it was ours so uh

00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,350
anyways we it's been a crazy year for us

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,780
last year when we came to in G com

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,520
that was our first time here and we're

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,100
kind of just getting started with the

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,930
project we had had 750,000 developers

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,630
you stack what's at that point and

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,640
400,000 projects have been created and I

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,900
don't know what happened since last year

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,490
you all must have been told all of your

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,500
friends and family and cousins and

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,720
mothers because now we've had 5.3

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,100
million developers you stack glitch

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,670
which is crazy this is crazy you've

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,829
created 2.2 million projects it's led us

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,140
to have some firsts this year we

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,579
actually add our first downtime we went

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,229
down for 15 minutes we tried to be

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,329
Facebook's record of 6 hours we couldn't

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,119
figure out how they did it we got 15

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,619
minutes in apparently our database got

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,030
so big our migration scripts actually

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,970
failed so we had to like rework how we

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,799
do migrations but yeah so it's been it's

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,189
been a crazy year and we just want to

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,290
say thank you to all of you this is

00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:54,149
because of you this project exists and

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,350
it's grown to this size and your support

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,750
and your feedback and all of your help

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,759
every day I really drives us to keep

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,290
working on the thing and so before we

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,820
get into anything else we just want to

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,250
say thank you and we love all of you so

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,810
we really appreciate it and thank you

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,750
for having us back this year we're

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,459
excited so this year we've been working

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,439
on some some cool stuff and

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:16,780
our goal with stacked lids is we want to

00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:19,299
create an online environment that's the

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,340
best place to develop debug and

00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:23,439
collaborate even better than like your

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,689
own local development environment that's

00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,069
like a pretty tall order but I think the

00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:29,290
the best way to show you some of the new

00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:30,879
stuff we've made is to just code a

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,200
really simple app together and show you

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,439
some of the new stuff we've been working

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,659
on so I'm gonna go to stack let's calm

00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,939
and first thing you'll notice is we have

00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:42,400
this nice homepage now it's like this

00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:43,750
Martian lunar landscape always feels

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,189
good to be inspired before you start a

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,200
new project it's got a nice little

00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:51,189
parallax effect so I'm going to click on

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,269
angular and boom I'm thrown into a live

00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:54,909
development environment that should look

00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:57,819
pretty familiar to those of you who have

00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:59,260
used applets before and if for those of

00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,669
you haven't used a quits you might be

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,739
like that looks like a lot like vs code

00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:05,079
and that's because it is it's actually

00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:06,849
vs code inside your browser I can hover

00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:08,680
over and see the type definitions for

00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:09,879
this thing it also ships out of the box

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,829
with hot reloading so I can say hello

00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:14,049
and gee comp and you'll see it update

00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:16,629
over there and last year when we were

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:18,609
here we actually introduced this really

00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:20,349
cool feature called teleport that lets

00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:22,150
you hop reload into bug across all of

00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:23,650
your devices really makes it amazing for

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,979
building like pwace and that sort of

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,349
thing

00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:28,209
so we've got some nice upgrades we've

00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:29,319
actually implemented into it recently so

00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,790
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna say I'm

00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:33,760
gonna rename this to make it a little

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:37,269
easier to get to so I'm calling this ng

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,799
comp demo app and all you have to do to

00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:40,239
use this is go and pull out your phones

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,659
and laptops if you want you can follow

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,729
along just go to ng comp - demo app dot

00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:47,769
stack with stud I own that URL right

00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:49,569
there that I've got highlighted so y'all

00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,979
can just open that up and as I develop

00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:53,590
this app it'll be hot reloading on your

00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:54,849
devices and what that happens you can

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,139
actually see the number of devices that

00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:57,759
are actually connecting live down here

00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:59,799
so you see that number going up right

00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,439
it's always a little scary it's that

00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,389
number rocketing during these demos so

00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,009
well while you all are connecting I'm

00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:07,269
gonna make some style changes to this

00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:08,829
app we're gonna create a little camera

00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:10,599
app nothing too crazy it's going to use

00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:12,220
your phone or laptops camera and put it

00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,650
on the screen so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:20,950
I'm gonna change the background color to

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:22,270
be to be red boom let's set the color to

00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,780
be white and actually I'm gonna connect

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,340
on my phone

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,170
to make sure you might want to be on

00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,920
your cellular I don't know if the

00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:33,190
airwaves are gonna get jammed up so let

00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,650
me go and punch in here is everyone

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:41,800
connecting fine so far

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:46,210
perfect okay demo app all right so I'm

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,170
connecting now to and so I'm gonna go

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,880
ahead and last thing going to change

00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,890
them into a command P go to my template

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:59,800
and I'm gonna change this out say let's

00:04:50,890 --> 00:05:01,030
build a camera app okay so you know the

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,890
first thing I usually do when I'm

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,060
starting out a new app is I create a get

00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,220
up repo because I'm probably gonna have

00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,750
to collaborate with people and if you

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,030
all have ever used

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,830
get up integrations and other IDs or

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,690
online environments usually they're a

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,460
little bit clunky not that easy to use

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,380
might not have all the functionality

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,630
that you need and so we worked really

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,940
hard on this new get up sync feature and

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,220
it's super easy and really powerful and

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,800
to use it you just click on this connect

00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:29,260
repository button and it just pops up

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,640
pre-fills the name of a repo I can even

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,430
make it private so I can just go do that

00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,540
and I click create repo and push so this

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,160
is actually creating a github repo

00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,690
committing to and this is all happening

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,070
inside of the browser it's not even

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,540
touching a server to do this which is

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:45,070
amazing and so I'm going to go ahead and

00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,260
is it hot reloading back there we go

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,760
and so I can open up this repo now you

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,890
can see it's been pushed to it 14

00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,640
seconds ago it's ready to rock and roll

00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,750
and so if I want to go ahead and you

00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,190
know create a feature on my local

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,450
machine I usually don't just commit to

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,240
master you can see we have this commit

00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,460
button usually I will create a branch

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,840
you know put my functionality in it into

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,970
it commit that and then do a pull

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,860
request right and so in stack which you

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,400
can do the exact same thing it's really

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,930
awesome

00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,340
you just choose your branch is going to

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,250
create a new branch we just say new

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,080
feature hit enter it's gonna go ahead

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,940
and just push a new branch right up to

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,169
get up and go over here so now i refresh

00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,830
see that we have this new feature right

00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:28,600
there rampe and so i'm gonna go ahead

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,640
and let's start building out the camera

00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,960
app right so I'm gonna run an angular

00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,580
generator this is one of my favorite

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,479
features I'm gonna create a component

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,240
I'm going to call it the camera

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,880
component

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,919
hit enter and off automatically

00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,460
scaffolds out this component creates a

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,349
folder and it imports it into our ng mod

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,289
module for us so it's ready to use now

00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:50,840
and I actually cheated save a little bit

00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:52,280
of time I coded up this sixty lines of

00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,060
code here I'm just gonna copy and paste

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,169
that right in here hit save and I'm

00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:03,650
gonna replace this with our app camera

00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:05,810
selector and so now on your phones you

00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,430
should now see yourselves and we've got

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,199
some cool little filters to use so I can

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,830
I can blur myself kind of like I'm

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:16,070
underwater or something sepia invert oh

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,360
that's weird so it's pretty cool take a

00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,440
look at that we have just about 500

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,310
people connected live is everyone still

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,990
getting this yeah sweet so we got this

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,550
our camera functionality is here we're

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,320
ready to ship it maybe we'll even I

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,360
don't that red really works great I'm

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,759
going to change it to a blue

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,400
I think that'll fit better with feels a

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,810
little more light to me alright so let's

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,030
go ahead commit this so I'll have to do

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,490
is just hit commit and automatically

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,409
will pre-fill our commit message I could

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,610
change my whomp and I'm kind of lazy so

00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:45,380
I'm just gonna hit the commit button and

00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,479
this is gonna go ahead and just push it

00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,699
right over to get up and if I go to get

00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:50,120
up I can do one click to do a pull

00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,770
request

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,610
just like my local development

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,889
environment right super nice and what's

00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,780
what's really nice about this

00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:01,099
integration specifically is if you for

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,750
example you have a co-worker that finds

00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:04,009
a bug that doesn't work on mobile or

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,270
something and they create a branch on

00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:06,680
get up and push to it

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,719
normally you have to like pull that down

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,219
clone it upload it somewhere so you can

00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:12,530
like have your phone connect to it it's

00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:13,610
a huge hassle right so if I want to

00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,560
switch a branch and see what it looks

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,539
like on my phone I can just click right

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,900
there this is actually cloning our

00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:22,430
application and recompiling it and ha

00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,750
true reloading it over-the-air to

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,030
everyone's devices so now we're back on

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,099
master right i could switch back right

00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,620
back to our new feature now we're back

00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:34,940
to our camera now right so it's pretty

00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:36,950
cool so we've got some cool stuff i'm

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,169
last year we showed this off you can

00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,599
actually have direct access to

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,740
everyone's phones consoles in here so

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,199
I'm gonna choose one person at random

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,050
I'm gonna throw an alert on their screen

00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:50,560
oh no they died they went away let me

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,560
find someone else

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:58,270
someone check on them alright so someone

00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,950
just got an alert on their phone Danny

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,290
one raise your hand I don't know so when

00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,210
someone probably did that's pretty cool

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,340
so you can do that and you know what got

00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,960
everyone's phones here maybe maybe I

00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,840
should mind some Bitcoin or something

00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,040
I'm just joking well I'm super lazy so

00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,360
like you know people always like follow

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,040
me on Twitter or whatever I never do it

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,210
cuz I'm like don't have the time or the

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,280
willpower so I'm just gonna I'm gonna do

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:20,850
all a favor and I'm gonna send you over

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,740
to our Twitter account right now alright

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,570
I'm just good save and so you go and

00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:29,700
follow us we'll just hit make make it

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:32,739
really easy for you okay so

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,739
[Applause]

00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,129
so that's pretty cool right so you can

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,949
kind of see how this is this is an

00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:46,769
environment that really is like nothing

00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:48,480
else out there right but we want to make

00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:50,759
stack blitz a great place to work on

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,870
production grade applications and when

00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,420
you're talking about building something

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,350
that fits into your production workflow

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,790
usually there's a lot of things that

00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,800
come with that right you're gonna want

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,589
to use angular Universal this isn't just

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,230
going to be a thin s.p.a you want

00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:05,999
server-side rendering right and that

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,160
means that you're gonna have to spin up

00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:10,139
a server you need nodejs maybe you want

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,509
to use different language like Python or

00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,920
something crazy like rust right and now

00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:16,589
we're talking about servers so that

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,059
means we need a cloud provider to

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,249
provision those servers and we need a

00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:22,529
database like save data to retrieve the

00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:24,449
data from and then we have to glue all

00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:26,249
this stuff together with our build and

00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:27,779
deploy scripts and then you hit that

00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:29,759
button to do the first deploy across

00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:32,970
your fingers you know what happens next

00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,980
never goes according to plan so we want

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,139
to solve this problem and today we're

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,329
really excited to announce our next

00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:41,670
generation development tool chain called

00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:43,920
production ready and it's really sweet

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,410
because it lets you go from idea to

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,899
production in one click and it lets you

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,420
do this by automatically scaffolding out

00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,740
all of your applications code and your

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,870
cloud infrastructure you're not to do

00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,009
anything it's like pretty amazing and it

00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:59,639
works with any language and any

00:10:56,009 --> 00:11:01,230
framework for your backends and as of

00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,790
today it works on Google cloud we've

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,069
been working with a couple of their

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:07,230
teams on their bleeding edge stuff and

00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:09,629
it's gonna be coming to AWS next and

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:12,629
maybe as your soon if if there's a dev

00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:15,300
advocates here and man it is AIT's a

00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:17,339
dream to use so let's go ahead and let's

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,199
give it a test drive shall we so I'm

00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,990
gonna go ahead and I'm gonna go back to

00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:24,779
stack let's calm and I'm just gonna

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:28,620
click start a new app and I'm going to

00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:30,870
give this a ng-conf SSR demo so I'm

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,519
gonna give the app a name they click on

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,480
angular universal you can see a whole

00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,649
bunch of different languages and

00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,350
frameworks I'm gonna enable Google Cloud

00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:41,970
I'm gonna create a get new github repo I

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,470
should click create out you can see we

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,300
have this like SpaceX like launch

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,550
sequence now going on for our app where

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,870
it's spinning up a dev environment

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:51,519
pushing to a new github repo just

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,829
created so we can open that up over here

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,869
see we got this docker and node stuff

00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:57,699
ready to rock and roll and it's doing an

00:11:55,869 --> 00:11:59,949
initial deployment to Google Cloud now

00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:05,470
of our app which we've done in a couple

00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:07,709
of seconds three two one Oh boom is that

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:11,679
not the coolest loading animation ever

00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:14,829
and so already my idea is on prot right

00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:17,499
I'm gonna open this up over here and I'm

00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:20,949
gonna right click view source you can

00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:23,980
see server-side rendering pretty amazing

00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:25,629
right and so normally we can go and just

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,249
clone this get up repo here get it

00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:29,559
running locally get all of our stuff

00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:30,610
installed but we made it a little bit

00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:33,220
easier we're gonna click this button

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:36,699
we'll see what it does and it turns out

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,800
we've got a very powerful version of our

00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:41,800
editor the next generation of it can run

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,050
full vs code extensions it's already up

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,910
and running so I can again comes out the

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,110
box with our hot reloading stuff so I

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:51,399
could say hello ng-conf

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:55,509
again hit save no no it's taking a

00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:57,100
little while there we go boom so I can I

00:12:55,509 --> 00:13:00,059
think we have a Google cloud logo in

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:03,879
here and open that up I'll enable that

00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:06,459
nice looks beautiful right so for us to

00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:08,920
get this back on production this box

00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:10,600
actually comes installed with everything

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,519
you need you're already logged in to all

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,230
of your services like Google Cloud the

00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,509
Google cloud CLI is ready to rock and

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,829
roll we even have a BS code extension so

00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:19,600
you can just hit this deploy button and

00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:21,040
this is running the exact same tool

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,629
chain that you run on your local when

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,980
you do a production bill screen a

00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:25,059
production container image it's

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,649
uploading that to the Google Cloud

00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:28,660
container registry and then pointing

00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:30,309
cloud run at that and this could be on

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,259
on production in just a couple of

00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,519
seconds but while that's going on let's

00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:35,649
go ahead and let's commit our changes to

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,569
get again and I already showed you our

00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:39,009
extension but what's awesome about this

00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:41,230
is that we can actually just use the

00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:42,579
command line and again we're already

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,619
logged in to get up we don't have to do

00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:46,449
anything here we have to set up sha SSH

00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:47,740
keys or anything like that you just have

00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:53,259
200 so I'm gonna go ahead and get out

00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:56,529
dot git commit dash gem stuff and then

00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:59,100
get push origin master I think I typed

00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:02,310
I'm right there we go

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,529
so I could go back over here see our

00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:08,430
commit just came in for that all right

00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:10,589
and let's take a look at our deployment

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,880
just about done just finish I'm gonna

00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:18,480
click open site it's gonna open up and

00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:20,970
cashew bust their bust there we go

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,970
boom so now our idea is already back on

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,970
pran right so really cool

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,920
so yeah you can see how this tool chain

00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,839
really makes it easy to fit in with

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,940
production your production workflow and

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,410
iterate on your ideas and everything and

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,150
this stuff is going into beta and you

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,600
can sign up for it on our site on stack

00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:44,400
what's comm and I just want to point out

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,870
that the people who made this actually

00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,580
came from the community earlier this

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,960
year we sent out a tweet it said we are

00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,370
underwater just keeping our servers

00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,720
online we need some help we have some

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,270
cool ideas we'd love to bring some folks

00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,950
in and these three gentlemen should be

00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,110
pretty familiar faces they're all from

00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,540
the angular community and everything you

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,390
saw today was them like they did all of

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,010
that and they are brilliant and talented

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:08,279
and it's well I've loved working with

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:10,320
them and it's just been a dream and we

00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:12,089
really appreciate it and a lot of people

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,890
have asked you know how can I support

00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:15,930
stack le'ts like how can I help you all

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,870
astronaut membership everything's kind

00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:34,110
of space themed here it's the price of a

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:35,760
Chipotle burrito so pretty affordable it

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:38,190
comes with lots of great stuff private

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,279

give you my phone number if you want to

00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,080
give me a call

00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,640
once production-ready is out of beta

00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,250
you'll get 20 full stack apps with it

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,440
and for those of you like really really

really loved us we also have a plan for

00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,580
you and that is our commander plan and

00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,440
it comes with all the amazing stuff and

00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,690
the astronaut plan but you get unlimited

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,640
full stack apps but even better is

00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,870
you're gonna have first access to all

00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,400
the latest things we're working on

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,420
including production ready so you're

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,830
gonna be the first people that have

00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,690
accessed that and all the other stuff

00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,010
we're working on but we're even going to

00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,570
bring all of our design and engineering

00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,830
stuff to you first

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,120
and you're gonna have your opinions

00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,570
going to be able to have a direct impact

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,310
on the way we're developing the platform

00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,680
so it's like a really cool opportunity

00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,900
to bring people into our process and how

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,040
we're prioritizing features and the sort

00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,770
of things that you all want to see in it

00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,200
right beyond that we have some cool

00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:34,589
events lined up for in-person and online

00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,760
and we'll every other now in them out of

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:38,190
the blue we'll send you something to

00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,839
your door like a t-shirt or a sticker I

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,800
know maybe something else

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,330
only one way

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,390
one way to find out is by signing up for

00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:47,010
the plan but with our new memberships

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,890
and you know we really want to give

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,779
everyone something that you really

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,860
couldn't find anywhere else and so a

00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,660
couple of weeks ago we were thinking

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,209
about this and we're like well you know

00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,459
our site is space themed ng-conf this

00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:01,380
year is space themed you know what if we

00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:04,500
let everyone launch something in the

00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,390
space like okay I mean like what could

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,400
they launch into space like okay well

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,500
what if we put like a web server into

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,829
space and they could like deploy their

00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,360
websites on to it from stackless and it

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,400
was like but it sounds crazy it even

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,809
possible and you know we're not rocket

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,240
scientists but it was a bit of a problem

00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:23,329
and so we called a couple of our friends

00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,069
who have a rocket launch company and

00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:29,010
they loved the idea and they were really

00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,820
excited about it so this is actually

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,090
happening

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,910
we can get your website onto the top of

00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,690
rocket launch into a space on our server

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,440
right

00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:42,750
and so this ng comp we can be the first

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,360
conference to launch something into

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,460
space and the way we are gonna get there

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,820
is we have to get a thousand web sites

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,100
ready to deploy to space by the end of

00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,750
the conference and because our astronaut

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,280
plan comes with one site and our

00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,320
commander plan comes with four sites and

00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,720
you can put into space we can totally do

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,540
this there's 1,400 people in this room

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,520
right now if two out of three of us sign

00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,800
up for the astronaut plan we're going to

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,390
space if one out of five of us sign up

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,280
for the commander plan we're still going

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,020
to space it's like we can totally do

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,309
this and we're kind of we're doing a

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,580
little Kickstarter style we bought a

00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:18,720
domain deploy to dot space and so I'll

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,000
go ahead and just open that real quick

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,370
get a feel for it you can see our

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,600
progress we got four 1248 sites that's

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,120
actually pretty decent we haven't

00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,650
announced this

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,650
[Laughter]

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,450
you can see our countdown for when the

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,550
the the doors are gonna shut on this

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,510
rocket we have a whole bunch information

00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,800
on the site we have this video this is

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,820
actually kind of embarrassing I'm not

00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,620
gonna play it on stage because it's

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,910
embarrassing but you should watch it

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,900
it's it's definitely cringe for sure

00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,820
people have already deployed their site

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:54,090
Stephen flew in one it's an angular dot

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,110
IO so that's going to space maybe you've

00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,210
seen Gerard Sands this one makes me

00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:02,550
laugh me to pull it up

00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:05,100
it's unicorns dabbing in space so that's

00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,650
yeah that's gonna be that's that's going

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,790
to be in space a whole bunch of cool

00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,170
stuff you can check these out can you

00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,460
ride it's got a really awesome one too

00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,950
so we have a whole bunch of information

00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,270
on this site and it's really simple once

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,190
you sign up for a membership on stack

00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,800
blitz there's now this deploy to space

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:21,990
button right there okay this is real I'm

00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,540
not joking and you click it I'm

00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,760
deploying this thing into space and it's

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:30,300
it's gonna go up should be done a couple

00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:33,000
of seconds here should be there we go

00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:35,880
boom alright so I can post about on

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,330
Twitter I've got it URL can open this up

00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,560
sure let's go over to it so you see

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,860
Eric's times has launched to this in the

00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,330
space so it's fun it's cool I'm gonna go

00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,340
back to the presentation so you see our

00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:51,690
camera apps in space and trying to

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:53,100
redirect to Twitter so I a Space Launch

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,730
won't be the same without a mission

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,470
patch and so we actually have 500 of

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,210

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,210
special powers if you put them on during

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,010
the conference you're gonna get high

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,510
fives if you don't have one on people

00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,040
are going to ask why don't you want to

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,620
go to space there's gonna be a bit of

00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,550
social accountability going on here and

00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,900

everyone who wants to use it and we hope

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:07,600
that this launch will inspire everyone

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,790
especially women and minorities to

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,610

00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:15,070
other STEM pursuits let's make it happen

00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:18,780
wants to be first to put his or her web

astronaut costumes come find us we'd

00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:56,120
love to chat about space going to space

00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:58,010
anything stack was for that matter so
