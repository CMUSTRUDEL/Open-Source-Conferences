	As PWAs continue to eat the marketshare for native apps, thereâ€™s still one area they havenâ€™t put a dent in: dev tools. In this talk weâ€™ll be unveiling a new suite of technologies weâ€™ve been working on that brings your local dev env fully into your browser.

ng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.
