Title: Blast Off with Angular Material | Rachel Noccioli
Publication date: 2019-05-06
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	This workshop is targeted at developers who are familiar with building Angular apps but who want to learn how to leverage the Angular Material component library to build great-looking apps without hand-coding all the components. We will discuss the Material Design system and add Angular Material and a few different components to an app in order to become comfortable using the library.

ng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.

00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:18,180
hi everyone welcome to blast off with

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,680
angular material today we're going to

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,289
get some hands-on practice with the

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,090
angular material library and we're gonna

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,660
see how we can build great looking apps

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,750
fast I'm Rachel Natoli I'm a software

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,090
developer at Oasis digital and I'm an

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,770
angular bootcamp instructor as a

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,370
software developer at a consulting

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:42,059
company I've had my share of clients who

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:44,940
haven't had the the resources or the

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:48,030
desire to go through a full design

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,250
process and it's not that they didn't

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,309
care about design because I can only

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,140
imagine what would happen if we wrote

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,719
the templates in the typescript and then

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,969
didn't ship any CSS I just don't think

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,730
that that would go over very well

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,549
so that's what brought us to using

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,510
angular material because we were able to

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,950
learn one system and then use it for

00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,560
multiple apps for multiple clients with

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:18,780
great success but notice that I said the

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:23,250
word system and by that I mean the

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,340
underlying design system material design

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,650
and so today we're going to talk about

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,439
why we should use an explicit design

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,659
system what is material design

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,670
specifically and then we're gonna do a

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,710
workshop where we're gonna build an app

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,049
and learn some more about angular

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:45,390
material and material design along the

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:47,850
way so yesterday during Steve influence

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,310
talk he mentioned that every app is

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,740
using a design system whether it's an

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,909
explicit one like material design or

00:01:52,740 --> 00:02:00,780
just kind of the ad-hoc evolution of the

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,250
look and feel of that's been created as

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,829
you as you create your app

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,600
everyone's using a design system but

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,840
today we're going to talk about these

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,910
explicit design systems which are like a

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,950
style guide for your visual and UI

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,920
design we're going to

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,140
by using a or a design system is going

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,040
to define what the individual pieces of

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,550
your app should look like and how they

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,640
will be well how they'll be composed and

00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:31,260
how they interact with each other

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,000
Courtney Clarke wrote a design system is

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,640
a series of components that can be

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,200
reused in different combinations

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,670
allowing companies to manage design at

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,819
scale so by using a design system you

00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:47,400
are leveraging the decisions that are

00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,680
made at the beginning about what all the

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,780
pieces should look like so that you get

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,790
a consistent look and feel throughout

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,980
and you don't end up with 20 different

00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:03,150
buttons with different sizes and colors

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:06,420
and you know different form UI's etc but

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,670
what if your team or your company your

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,760
client doesn't have the resources to

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:18,600
create a design system a custom design

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:20,640
system in this case you can use the use

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,799
an open-source design system that's been

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,690
created by a large book these large

00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:26,430
companies that created these design

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:31,079
systems for themselves but then put out

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:34,320
some information about them for for use

00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:37,170
by all the developers outside of the org

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,510
and VMware's clarity Salesforce is

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,970
lightning and IBM's carbon are a few

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,220
examples of open source design systems

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:48,350
but of course today we're going to talk

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:50,730
about Google's material design and

00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,860
material design we can find more

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,640
information about that at material do

00:03:52,860 --> 00:04:04,049
and the tagline is build beautiful

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:09,769
products faster so by using material

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:12,150
design we can like leverage all of the

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:15,690
the design decisions that have been made

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:19,200
by the teams at Google to create our own

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:22,770
apps and I'm going to point out in this

00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:25,200
design section there's all of this

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,540
information about how to use the design

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,500
system so like I said

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:35,090
the these organizations have created

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,280
these for internal use but then they've

00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:43,020
they put information out to the public

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:46,950
about how to use them and so here in

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,450
environment we can see get some

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,090
information about like sort of the

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:54,900
philosophy of what material is and

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:59,700
material has is sort of built on this

00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:01,440
metaphor of paper where we have paper

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,290
sheets of paper in the real world and

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,750
then it sort of reimagined for digital

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:10,220
devices so there's all this information

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:13,350
about how this like metaphor kind of

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,780
manifests itself within the design

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,670
system so there's guidance about what

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:22,230
you should do and what you shouldn't do

00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:27,540
and information about how shadows work

00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:29,820
because there's different different

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:35,910
elevations so we have some information

00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:40,860
about how all of the the different

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:51,560
pieces of in the like in your app are

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:51,560
going to kind of look but the material

00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:02,100
the material sorry the material team

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,470
likes to say that material is an

00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,740
adaptable design system it's not that

00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:11,880
every app has to look exactly the same

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:15,390
not every material app is gonna use the

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,920
exact same UI features you can

00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:20,940
specifically with angular angular

00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,770
material you can customize the colors

00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:27,530
and typography to fit the branding

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,530
experience for your particular customer

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,360
so specifically what is angular material

00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:37,050
it's an angular component library that

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,510
implements material design so you can

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,410
use angular material just as a component

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,360
set of

00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,130
various components and pick and choose

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,590
which ones you want but you'll get the

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,930
full power of angular material when you

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:53,760
look at it as this implementation of a

00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:55,530
design system and I'm gonna go to the

00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:02,100
the documentation so we'll be at

00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:08,970
material angular dye oh and here we can

00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:11,850
find the the main dock docks for angular

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,340
material and the angular material team

00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:17,580
is part of the angular team at Google

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:20,370
which is kind of a big benefit because

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,490
they are working closely with the

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:28,980
framework authors to create a great

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:32,780
experience as as like for us as

00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,780
developers who are using that framework

00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:37,170
so again there's a lot of information

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:40,860
here in the docs we're going to become

00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:44,070
familiar with the how the Doc's work and

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,170
when we get to the workshop but first

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:51,180
let's just talk about how we can get

00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:53,400
started with angular material so there's

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:57,420
this schematic that's built into angular

00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,610
so if you just run ng add angular slash

00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,740
material it's going to do some code

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:05,460
generation for you it'll do some NPM

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:08,310
installs it's gonna add some a little

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,050
bit of code and this is of course only

00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:15,270
going to work if you're using a CLI

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:17,330
application but if you are not then you

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,010
can get information about what this

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:23,780
schematic is doing and either way it's

00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:27,030
good to know the specific details about

00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,800
how that install process works but it's

00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:32,400
not required for you to get up and

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,190
running with angular material in the

00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:39,840
workshop we are going to be using stack

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:41,820
'lets so and stack lets doesn't support

00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:45,240
running like arbitrary commands right

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:48,360
now so I've already run that ng ad at

00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,220
angular slash material for you but I

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,630
just want you guys to be familiar with

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,630
what that's going to be

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:06,310
okay so the workshop is going to be

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:07,210
found at the I created this bitly - for

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:12,160
easy navigation

00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:15,030
so it's bitly slash blast - off - am so

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,900
if everyone can take a minute to

00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:22,030
navigate to that site you will find a

00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,390
github repo that I've created for this

00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,390
workshop

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:37,450
down here in the readme we have a link

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,220
to the final demo just be sure to open

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:43,180
that in a new tab so that you can keep

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:46,870
the instructions open and like I said

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,400
we're gonna be working in stack blitz so

00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,770
that's gonna open up a stack let's link

00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:53,680
I'm gonna open the app in a new window

00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,810
so we can see it full screen and today

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,460
we're gonna be building an astronaut

00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,110
directory so we're gonna get some

00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:04,360
information about all the current NASA

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:07,120
astronauts and then have a faceted

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:12,030
search with using all angular material

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:15,040
components so almost all of this page is

00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:18,220
angular material components there's very

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:22,530
little CS or a sorry HTML on here that

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:26,100
I've had to write other than the content

00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:31,570
so we have a header across the top and

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:35,710
then we have a menu over here I can make

00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:38,800
this a little bit bigger that helps we

00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:40,240
have these cards here in the center and

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,730
each card is going to have some

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,130
information about one of the National

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:50,140
NASA astronauts and we can see all of

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:54,130
the astronauts here and then over here

00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:56,230
we have a form field with an input so if

00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:58,480
I click there we can search astronauts

00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:01,930
it's not quite wired up I tried to keep

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,630
this demo focused on the HTML and CSS

00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:09,150
for really focusing on the angular

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:13,630
material pieces and then we also have

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:15,340
this list of the number of spacewalks

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:18,490
and then the undergraduate major so

00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,750
these are angular material lists and

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,560
then in here we have this angular

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:26,940
material divider I don't know if that's

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,380
totally obvious on the the projector but

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:35,680
okay so that is what we're going to be

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:41,440
building today let's see what step one

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:44,750
is going to be yeah so for step one we

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,550
are going to add a matte

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,950
component but before you get started

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,930
let's just go take a look at the

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:54,170
documentation to see how we're going to

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:57,620
do that so up here in the documentation

00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:03,650
we have the components screen and then

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:05,480
in navigation we have this tool bar so

00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:10,760
here we get some information about the

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:12,470
usage of the tool bar and this

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,420
information where it says mat toolbar is

00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,330
a container for headers titles or

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:20,660
actions is kind of a callback to

00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:22,090
material design and it's giving us some

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:27,050
information about like why this

00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:30,470
component was created and it's not just

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:32,420
like oh if you want a gray rectangle or

00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,460
whatever color rectangle on your screen

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:38,240
there's sort of a purpose behind it

00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:41,150
coming from the material design spec so

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,970
the next piece of information here is an

00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:47,330
example with the basic toolbar and if

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:49,310
you click the open closed brackets you

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,290
can actually see the source code for

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,290
that little example and it's pretty

00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:57,410
simple all you need is a matte toolbar

00:12:53,290 --> 00:13:00,080
opening tag the angular material prefix

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:05,300
is going to be ma t so every component

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:07,970
will have that ma t prefix and then just

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,030
the content and then the closing tag and

00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:17,390
that there's no type script really and

00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:18,890
there's no CSS for a toolbar so then we

00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:24,110
get a little bit of information about

00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:25,760
the usage of the toolbar and if we want

00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:27,230
a single row or multiple rows the

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,910
default is just a single row with some

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:34,520
content all right that's what we're

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:37,280
going to create today and some

00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,350
information about theming and then some

00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,460
information about accessibility and I'll

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,260
just point out here that it says

00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,510
generally the toolbar is used as a

00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:47,060
header we're role equals heading would

00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:48,710
be appropriate and in our case we are in

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,050
fact doing that we're creating a header

00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:57,860
for our page we're going to use an h1

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:59,090
tag to include the words for our for our

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,290
title

00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:07,670
and so we're going to use that role

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:10,850
equals heading one other part that I'm

00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:13,670
going to point out is in the API where

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:17,750
we have information about how to get

00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:20,810
access to this particular component so

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:24,530
we did with that schematic we have done

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:26,090
an NPM install of angular material but

00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,000
angular material is broken out into

00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:33,500
separate ng modules so pretty much every

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,270
component has its own ng module so every

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,910
time you want to use a component you

00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:40,850
will have to do this import and then

00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:43,550
also add it to the imports of the ng

00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,250
module where you're trying to use the

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:48,590
angular material component so if you

00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,300
have a more complex app with multiple

00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:53,660
modules and you're trying to use the

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:56,450
toolbar in three different modules

00:14:53,660 --> 00:15:00,770
you'll have to import it into each of

00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:02,480
those modules then there's just a little

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,520
bit of information about what the the

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,290
individual directives are so we're going

00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,210
to be just using the matte toolbar mat

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,240
toolbar but if you had multiple rows

00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:12,290
you'd also have a matte toolbar row and

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,880
then some information about the

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:19,670
properties where it has the input color

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,000
and it's themed palette so a theme

00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:26,900
palette is let's just jump back to the

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,910
overview to this theming section where

00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,980
it says that the color can be changed

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,390
with the color property by default it

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,210
has a neutral background that's that

00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:38,210
grey that we saw before but it can be

00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:41,120
changed to primary accent or worn so

00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:45,010
that is those are the different values

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,010
that you can use for that theme palette

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,529
and then if this component had any

00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:56,250
methods available to us then they would

00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:59,300
also be listed here and then we finally

00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:03,089
have some example of a more complicated

00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:06,000
toolbar so we can open that up to see

00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:07,920
the code for the more complicated one

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,170
but of course we're gonna just be making

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:16,889
a pretty simple one today so back over

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:20,160
in the step we will see the different

00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:22,290
instructions for getting this step

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,160
completed the first one is import the

00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:28,740
matte toolbar module into app module and

00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:31,519
if you're not sure what to do for any of

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:34,529
these steps notice this little black

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,629
triangle and if you click on that or the

00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:39,029
the instruction it'll open it up and

00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:41,310
it'll show you the code so I would

00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:44,189
encourage everyone to try to like look

00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:46,019
at the docs and really think about what

00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:49,230
the the step is trying to get you to do

00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:52,889
and if you get stuck don't worry because

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:56,059
the code is there but do try to to work

00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:58,439
on the the step on your own first and

00:16:56,059 --> 00:17:00,480
then the second part is replace the

00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:02,069
welcome message with the toolbar so to

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,809
get started you're gonna follow this

00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:06,630
instruction here open this top foot

00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:13,679
stack blitz to get started so again open

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:18,059
that in a new tab and I'm gonna open the

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:22,409
the completed demo so that we can see

00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:24,890
what the what the UI will look like once

00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,890
we're done

00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:34,070
all right so that'll just take a minute

00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,260
so once you're done with this step you

00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:41,540
should have a purple header and it

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:43,700
should say astronaut directory okay so

00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,680
let's take a few minutes to work on that

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,620
if you have any questions raise your

00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,140
hand and I'll come around or my coworker

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:59,600
Paul here will be available to assist

00:17:51,140 --> 00:18:01,970
you so we can see the code here that is

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,670
also in the the github repo but we just

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:08,770
added the Matt toolbar we use that color

00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:11,510
equals primary to get the theming and

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,820
then we included an h1 tag with

00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:16,070
astronaut directory and of course we had

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,720
to add it to the module as well so we

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:20,330
import the match full of our module from

00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,600
angular slash material slash toolbar and

00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:27,100
then we add it to the imports array of

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,100
our app module

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,580
okay so before we go to step two let's

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:48,820
jump back to the slides we had we did a

00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:50,620
walkthrough of the docs for step one but

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,560
I just wanted to reiterate the three

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:55,900
different parts of the docs and the

00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,000
first screen that we have for each of

00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,460
the components is gonna be the overview

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,450
and it'll give you some basic usage and

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:06,550
some information about accessibility and

00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:08,950
then there's the API screen it'll tell

00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:11,520
you specifically how to import the

00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,390
angular material module into your module

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,250
you're gonna need to do that for every

00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,540
component and then it'll give you some

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,790
information about the specific

00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,980
properties and methods and then there

00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:24,100
will be an example screen so you can see

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,960
the code usually for a slightly more

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,160
complicated example or in the case of

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,140
components that can be used in multiple

00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:39,790
ways you'll see an example of each of

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:52,000
those ways okay so back in the github

00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:53,560
repo we can go to step two and if you if

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,410
you for whatever reason weren't able to

00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,660
finish step one you can click here on

00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,310
the step to setup demo so don't be

00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,890
worried if you can't get through a step

00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:06,460
you can always catch back up with the

00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:08,260
setup demos so in this step we're going

00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:16,210
to add a mat side nav component and

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:24,210
we're gonna scaffold out the app so

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:24,210
let's go look at the side nav component

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:34,309
here we're gonna have actually let's

00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:38,440
just look at the example over here so

00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:42,049
we're gonna kind of scaffold out this

00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:45,679
this left bar and then this section over

00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:48,350
here with the where the cards are going

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,080
to be so at the end we're going to just

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:57,520
have two sections of the app with labels

00:20:51,080 --> 00:21:01,690
for each section so in the side nav

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:03,770
docks we can see that it's about

00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,480
collapsible side content in our case

00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:10,220
we're not going to collect it we're just

00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:13,610
going to have it up there and we'll have

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,770
a side nav container and then a side nav

00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,779
and a side nav content so we'll have

00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,210
those that wrapper is going to be the

00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:23,690
side nav container and then we'll have a

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:26,919
side nav a matte side nav will be the

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:31,090
left-hand side and then a matte side nav

00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:31,090
content will be the right-hand side

00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:44,830
so it says that there's going to be a

00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:47,890
position property and the position can

00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:50,370
be start or end so we'll use position

00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,370
start

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:03,240
and then there's a whole bunch of

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:15,950
information on here but we're not going

00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:15,950
to need to use most of that okay

00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,940
so we can also see in the API the side

00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:34,020
nav is going to be a lot more

00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:37,370
complicated than the the the toolbar so

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,370
there's a lot more information in here

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:56,790
we are going to let me jump back to the

00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:58,740
overview and it says the opened state

00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,510
can also be set via property binding in

00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:06,000
the template using the opened property

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:08,960
so you can just put the o opened on your

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,800
side nav and it'll just always be open

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,930
okay so jumping back over to step two

00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,760
we're gonna have to import the side nav

00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,850
module and then add the side nav

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,770
container and and it's children that I

00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,660
just mentioned and then we're gonna add

00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,570
some CSS to layout the page and we're

00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:32,580
gonna use a little bit of CSS grid today

00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:35,790
and pretty much all of the CSS that

00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:37,830
you're going to write in in an angular

00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,870
material app is gonna be for layout

00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:42,740
because of course the angular material

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:44,700
library can't know how your how your

00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,420
particularly what your particular needs

00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:50,340
are for laying out your app you're gonna

00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:53,700
have to tell it where to put the

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:55,200
components on the page so most mostly

00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,820
you're going to be writing CSS for

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,140
layout

00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:01,080
hopefully you shouldn't be writing a ton

00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:04,350
of CSS to override the angular material

00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:09,030
library okay so let's take another few

00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:16,770
minutes to work through this step okay

00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:19,050
so with that step we added we added our

00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:25,820
mat side nav container with the mat side

00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:29,040
nav we included the mode equals side

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:33,020
opened and the role equals region that

00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,020
was just one of the Aria tags

00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:41,429
that that was talked about in the

00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:44,530
accessibility section of the the

00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:46,510
documentation and then the mat side F

00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:55,360
content also got the role equals region

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:57,669
and then we just put main content and we

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:06,570
also had to add the mat side nav module

00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:10,210
and add it to our imports and down here

00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:13,360
okay so I want to jump back to the

00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,919
slides for just a second and talk about

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,200
some of the benefits of of angular

00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:20,290
material and one of those benefits is

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,850
visual polish so when you're using the

00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:25,530
angular material library you're gonna

00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:28,510
have these pre-built components that are

00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:32,530
that were like inspired by the material

00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:35,020
design spec and there is a whole team at

00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:37,870
Google of like visual designers and UX

00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:40,990
designers who are responsible for

00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:43,000
creating this library and leaning on

00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:45,730
their expertise can be really helpful

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,350
when your team doesn't have the the

00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:52,840
resources to create the design system

00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:57,160
and and or doesn't want to write like

00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:59,440
handwrite all of the CSS to create your

00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:04,020
apps so you can lean on the angular

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,020
material library for that visual polish

00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:11,080
the other one of the other benefits is

00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:15,720
accessibility so material design has a

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:18,309
whole section of the documentation about

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:23,020
accessibility and there are all of these

00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:27,549
different these sections about talking

00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:28,450
about how you should like the different

00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:33,250
things that you need to think about

00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:35,350
within your apps and because angular

00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:38,020
material is an implementation of

00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:40,450
material design the angular material

00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:44,200
team has paid a lot of attention to

00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:46,360
making the components accessible and so

00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,019
they have

00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,220
done a lot of testing and made sure that

00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:53,019
the components are going to be

00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:56,289
accessible to people using screen

00:26:53,019 --> 00:27:00,809
readers or using like only keyboard

00:26:56,289 --> 00:27:03,460
navigation so you can read more about

00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:07,840
material designs accessibility in in

00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:11,440
there Docs and then you can read more

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:15,460
about the the accessibility concerns in

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:22,600
each of the component documentation

00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:24,100
steps so so each of the pages is going

00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,279
to have a section about accessibility

00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:30,159
and there that's basically whatever

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,889
information the material design team

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,169
felt that people who are using the

00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:37,240
library needed to know and in a lot of

00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:41,620
cases it's going to be things that you

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:44,980
need to do as as a software developer

00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:47,320
using this library to make sure that

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:51,639
you're the the way that you're using the

00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,559
component is going to be accessible the

00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:55,389
library can't know about that all of the

00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:58,529
individual use cases that you're using

00:27:55,389 --> 00:28:01,899
so in a lot of cases you have to specify

00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:12,940
Aria tags for example for screen readers

00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:14,080
and then the third way that we can make

00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,419
sure that our apps are going to be

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,740
accessible is using the component dev

00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:24,549
kit and so the CDK is a companion

00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:28,480
library to angular material and it has

00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:31,299
some utilities that allow you to manage

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,029
focus for example and you can say okay

00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:37,289
which piece of the app it should be

00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:41,529
focused ballif a user is using a

00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:43,659
keyboard only and can't use a mouse so

00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:47,919
that's just one more way that you can

00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:50,669
make sure that all users are going to be

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,669
able to use your apps

00:28:52,280 --> 00:29:00,520
okay so step three we're gonna start

00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:04,490
getting some content on our screen and

00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:12,530
here we're going to add a mat card for

00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:19,690
each astronaut so over in the

00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:23,210
documentation under the layout section

00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:25,820
there's card and it tells us that mat

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:27,830
card is a content container for text

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,670
photos and actions in the context of a

00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:33,740
single subject so the material design

00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:36,200
purpose of using a card is when you have

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,670
multiple different items and you need to

00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,970
show some information about each

00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:46,970
different thing if you notice in the

00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:48,680
example each of these cards has a little

00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:54,020
bit of elevation so there's a little bit

00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:55,760
of a shadow behind them if all you're

00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:58,760
looking for is to have some sort of

00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:02,690
container with that little bit of shadow

00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:05,270
you don't need to use a mat card I just

00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:08,630
want to point out in the guides over

00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:12,110
here there is a section about using

00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:14,780
elevation helpers so over here we can

00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:17,870
find information about how we can use

00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:20,180
the built-in CSS classes that are that

00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:23,030
come with angular material to get that

00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:26,060
little bit of shadow and there's like

00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:29,690
different levels that you can that you

00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:36,170
can use but in the case where we are in

00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:39,230
fact showing multiple we have like

00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,610
multiple subjects and we want to display

00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,140
some information then we're going to use

00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:46,430
in that card so that's what we're doing

00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:47,630
we have a whole bunch of astronauts and

00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:51,620
we need to know some information about

00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:54,710
them so there's some information about

00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:57,710
the basic card sections and this comes

00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:01,100
from the material design spec so a card

00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:04,060
is going to have or it can have a title

00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:10,150
subtitle content a card image

00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:12,300
shins or a footer it doesn't it doesn't

00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:15,280
really have to have any of these things

00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:17,890
but depending on what you want to

00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:31,900
display to your users you can use any or

00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:34,810
all of these okay so back over in the

00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,760
step I'm going to open the completed

00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:43,320
demo so we can see what that's going to

00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:44,500
look like and if you open this bottom

00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,630
instruction

00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:53,320
oh I epic fail

00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:54,960
this is not not the easiest to read but

00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,460
you can kind of see the type script type

00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,970
each astronaut is going to have a name

00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:02,620
that's a string if you see in here

00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,420
there's an undergraduate major that's a

00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,690
string just so that you can like put

00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,520
whatever information you want to have

00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:11,140
for your astronaut

00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,840
it doesn't need to like the content of

00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,340
the of the card is not like what

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,290
information you display it about about

00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:20,080
the astronaut doesn't really matter but

00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:21,760
just in case you're wondering so we're

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:27,310
gonna add the Matt card you're gonna use

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:29,140
an NG for to iterate over all of the

00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:31,060
astronauts I've already included the

00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,400
data for you so there's a property on

00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:36,930
app component astronauts and it's an

00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:39,550
observable of an astronaut all right

00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:45,210
okay so let us know if you have any

00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:45,210
questions so here we have our

00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,559
[Music]

00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:57,140
our mat cards inside of our mat side nav

00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:00,350
content we just used in ng for to make

00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:02,900
sure we have one for each astronaut we

00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:05,240
have the mat card title with the

00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:09,140
astronauts name then we have an image

00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,760
with a mat card image directive and then

00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:13,940
we bind to the source

00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:16,970
the astronauts photo and then in here I

00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:20,420
used a definition list to create the

00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:23,330
those two columns for the keys and the

00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:25,790
values and I'll just point out here the

00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,590
class the classes that I used I didn't

00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:31,700
create these the mat small and the mat

00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:34,220
body - those are built-in classes to the

00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:42,950
angular material library as part of the

00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:46,580
typography like helpers all right and

00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:49,490
then of course we imported into or we

00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:52,429
imported the mat card module imported it

00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:58,940
into our ng module and then added some

00:33:52,429 --> 00:34:06,140
CSS to give us again just that that

00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:10,460
those layouts okay so back over in the

00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:12,139
slides I have a slide about the speed of

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:17,840
development so this kind of takes two

00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:20,389
forms which is on the sort of the design

00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,859
side you don't have to make a ton of

00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:23,659
decisions about what everything is going

00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:26,629
to look like your headers are gonna kind

00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:28,310
of follow the pattern you're gonna have

00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:30,830
the cards you're gonna have all these

00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:32,960
different guidelines that are going to

00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:37,580
sort of shape what you're gonna build

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,889
and then the second piece is that this

00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:42,440
is of course a component library so the

00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:44,629
angular material team has done a lot of

00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:49,340
work to create these components and

00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:51,260
write the CSS and the HTML for you so

00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,240
you don't have to write that all

00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:58,430
yourself I did this workshop one other

00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:59,750
time and the one of the attendees said

00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,270
that they were only using the angular

00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:04,820
material library for the inputs that

00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:06,020
we're gonna see in a minute but he said

00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,370
just using the angular material for

00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,500
input saved him a week's worth of work

00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:13,690
because he didn't have to think about

00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:16,700
how to like write all those styles and

00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:22,070
we'll see the little animation that it

00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:27,530
gives you with with the label okay so

00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:28,490
step four we are going to populate that

00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:32,630
side nav

00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:35,780
with a search box and the those filter

00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,460
options so you're gonna have to open up

00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:43,930
here to see which energy modules we're

00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:51,260
gonna use I will open the docs and show

00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:53,480
the the input and here it says Matt

00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:55,400
input is a directive that allows native

00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,590
input and text area elements to work

00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,780
with Matt form field so when you use

00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:03,230
them that input you're going to be using

00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:07,010
it within a map form field component so

00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:10,160
just I just want to point out that it

00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:12,140
doesn't specifically say in the API here

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,630
it just tells you Oh import Matt and

00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:18,370
Matt input module you also have to

00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:22,370
import the form field module I

00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:24,770
definitely run into errors with that so

00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:27,230
if you're following the code in my step

00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:28,850
of course it's it's included in there

00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:31,790
but in the future when you're trying to

00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:33,440
use a matte input just be aware that the

00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:35,600
Matt input in the form field they're in

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:43,790
separate modules you have to import both

00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:48,260
of those so the basic input is going to

00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:51,230
be a form field and then you have a

00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:53,600
native HTML input with the matte input

00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:56,180
directive so we're not creating a

00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,610
component here we're just adding the

00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:01,340
directive matte input and then the the

00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:03,620
library is going to take take over the

00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:07,640
control and and add some styling for us

00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:10,640
and then here the placeholder is going

00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:15,050
to have sort of a little special

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:18,109
behavior where if I delete this and then

00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:19,609
I blur this is the

00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:21,440
what is sort of styled as the

00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:23,660
placeholder and then when I click in

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,660
here it gets animated up into a label

00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:29,989
and technically under the hood this is

00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:32,200
always a label and HTML label which is

00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:35,690
ensuring that this is going to be

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:39,619
accessible but we kind of get that

00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:42,200
little that little built-in animation so

00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:45,739
one of the things that the install

00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:49,880
schematic did was import the angular

00:37:45,739 --> 00:37:52,160
animations library sorry the material

00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:55,279
animations library and then it added

00:37:52,160 --> 00:38:01,279
that also to our app module so we get

00:37:55,279 --> 00:38:06,499
those those little like nice like the

00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:09,140
little like helpful animation and that

00:38:06,499 --> 00:38:10,999
sort of relates back to the next slide

00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:13,220
that I have about angular material and

00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:16,009
that's consistency so when you're using

00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:19,940
these inputs your your users are gonna

00:38:16,009 --> 00:38:21,559
get sort of used to having the that that

00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:24,950
little animation they're gonna get used

00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:27,019
to looking at the input knowing what

00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:29,210
what sort of information they need to

00:38:27,019 --> 00:38:31,309
put in to it there's always going to be

00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:33,739
some sort of learning curve with Korea

00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,960
with learning how to how to use a new

00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:38,809
app but because you're going to be using

00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,910
the same inputs throughout your entire

00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:43,039
app the users won't have to like

00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:55,789
constantly relearn where to look for the

00:38:43,039 --> 00:39:00,859
information alright so step four we are

00:38:55,789 --> 00:39:03,980
also going to be using a mat divider to

00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:06,309
go between that input and then the the

00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:12,769
lists that we'll be using

00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:16,880
so over here we see where is it under

00:39:12,769 --> 00:39:19,249
layout there's divider and then this is

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,009
a super basic you just have a match

00:39:19,249 --> 00:39:23,779
divider open tag and then on that divide

00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:26,809
our closing tag so that's just gonna

00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:28,490
give you the that thin gray line just

00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:32,450
like right here that you

00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:41,000
see on the screen and then the third

00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:43,910
thing that we're gonna do is use an NG

00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,950
for over a mat list and we're gonna get

00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:51,680
put the information about each of those

00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:56,990
different filter groups so mat list over

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:59,090
here under layout you'll have a mat list

00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:01,610
component and then you'll have a mat

00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:06,140
list item component and you'll use an NG

00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:12,350
for on that to get each of the each of

00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:15,530
the items so I will open up what the

00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:17,720
completed demo will look like and then

00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:21,980
let let us know if you have any

00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:24,640
questions okay so let's see the code for

00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,640
this step

00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:43,260
so in here we have a nested ng4 so we

00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:48,180
sorry let me jump way back we have

00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:50,430
inside of our mat side nap container or

00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:54,570
it's re inside of our mat side nav we

00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:57,930
have a mat form field and then an input

00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:59,460
and then of course we have this mat

00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,470
input and that's gonna give us the

00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,790
styling for the input and then the

00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:05,359
placeholder is going to give us that

00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:09,750
like that label with that little

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:14,100
animation then we put a mat divider

00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:19,080
underneath the search section and then

00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:21,869
we have an NG container for each of the

00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:24,600
filters so we have an NG for let filter

00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:28,200
of filters and the filters aren't

00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,940
observable so we pipe a sink and then

00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,960
we're just capturing which one is the

00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:36,869
last of the filter of the filters and we

00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:40,230
at least well sort of alias it as itself

00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:43,950
so we just call last as last so down

00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:45,900
here we just check if to make sure that

00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:48,510
we're not on the last of the filters and

00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:51,450
we put another mat divider so that if we

00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:54,869
had well for even in this case we have

00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:57,660
one mat divider that's going to separate

00:41:54,869 --> 00:42:00,000
these two sections so that's this guy

00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:05,400
down here but we don't have another mat

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:08,190
divider at the end and then within this

00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:14,670
NG container we are going to iterate

00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:17,220
over a mat list and then each mat list

00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:21,720
is going to have a header and we use the

00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:24,000
mat sub header directive and we put the

00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,250
display name and then we iterate over

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,340
the mat list items so that we can see

00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:35,700
each of the the potential values that we

00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:37,440
could be filtering by so we end up again

00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:41,670
with the search at the top of that

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:45,310
divider and then two lists and then each

00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:49,660
has a header and then a bunch of matte

00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:56,890
list items and in in my case I made them

00:42:49,660 --> 00:43:00,160
each buttons just for the next step

00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:01,960
we'll see what he's actually well I

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,690
guess in here we we have a click event

00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,570
so we need to just make sure that it's

00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:09,430
gonna be something that's focusable so

00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:12,150
when you click on the button it's going

00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:14,350
to change the filter and to the

00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:17,020
individual one that we clicked on and

00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:20,710
there's visually we don't have anything

00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:24,690
yet but in the next step we will see how

00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:24,690
the how that's going to work

00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:35,320
okay so then we again had some CSS and

00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:37,240
then we had to import these five

00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,740
different modules mat form filled module

00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,050
Matt input module and that divider

00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:45,540
module Matt list module and that button

00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:45,540
module to get all of this to work

00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:57,570
okay so let's jump back to the slides

00:43:52,770 --> 00:44:01,470
and talk a bit about usability so

00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:05,540
usability is just making an experience

00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:08,520
for your users that is intuitive and

00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:10,820
again the material design team at Google

00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,890
has placed a high priority on making

00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:17,040
like having high usability and they have

00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:21,990
a whole team of usability experts doing

00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:24,720
research on how to how to make the

00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:27,630
individual components usable so you

00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,780
don't have to worry about oh is this

00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:33,630
particular component going to be

00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:39,180
intuitive you can kind of rely on the

00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:46,260
expertise at Google to to make sure that

00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:51,680
your app is also going to be usable all

00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:57,060
right so then step 5 we are going to

00:44:51,680 --> 00:45:03,619
turn the each of those Matt list items

00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:03,619
or change that list into a Matt chip if

00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:13,770
where is the so if I click on a button

00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:16,170
here then it's going to turn into a chip

00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,270
to say okay I've selected number two and

00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:22,170
then it has a little close button and

00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:24,660
that will unselect and again the the

00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:26,490
actual filtering is not included in here

00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,319
so don't be alarmed if this doesn't

00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:34,910
actually filter it's mostly just about

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:34,910
this UI sorry what

00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:43,740
I mean in this case like that's not this

00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:45,270
the user experience I mean you would

00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:54,360
just have to like do it a little bit

00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:56,520
differently so this isn't like a

00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:00,750
built-in thing we're gonna see the code

00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:03,870
for it and I I wrote some cool I wrote

00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:06,060
some code that's going to look at the

00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:09,630
filter and see if there's a value for

00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:15,900
that filter then display a chip instead

00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:17,430
of the list so this isn't unfortunately

00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:22,560
this isn't really built in it's just

00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:25,110
something that that I sort of borrowed

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,480
from a Google site so there's a lot of

00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:28,500
you know with material design when

00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,940
you're thinking about okay what am I

00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,160
going to build there's material I owe

00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:36,660
and you can look at the examples that

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:38,520
they have in there and then pretty much

00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,110
all of Google Sites are also using

00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,180
material design so you can look through

00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:45,270
those sites and I kind of pulled this

00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:46,980
from like a Google cloud platform site

00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:49,620
where they had this like faceted search

00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:56,580
and they just kind of did this so that

00:46:49,620 --> 00:47:05,120
was my inspiration for for this okay so

00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:05,120
we can see the code for a chip down here

00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:11,810
and we're gonna have a match ship list

00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,510
and then a Matt chip and in our case

00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:18,400
we're just gonna have one chip because

00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:18,400
it will just have one value

00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:33,660
so there's gonna be a little bit of code

00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:39,300
to kind of switch between that Matt list

00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:42,500
and then the Matt chip and again you can

00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:44,640
see the code in here if you're not like

00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:54,000
super comfortable with writing all the

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:56,460
like MGF and and why not so I will open

00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,270
the completed demo and then let us know

00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:04,050
if you have questions okay so for the

00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:05,640
next step we are going to jump ahead to

00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:07,110
step seven and we're going to come back

00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,640
to step six

00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:12,620
I just want to make sure that we hit

00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:17,090
step seven before we close

00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:20,820
so step seven is going to be about

00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:23,190
theming so I said earlier that every

00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:28,740
material app doesn't have to look

00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:32,790
exactly the same you can use your own

00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:36,450
brands colors and typography to create a

00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:37,140
sort of a branded experience and here I

00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:40,440
have a list

00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:46,050
I'm sorry I'll link to a material theme

00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:48,840
generator so if you open that then you

00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:51,420
will see this it's going to make a

00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:57,150
really easy way to create all of the CSS

00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:59,250
that you're going to need to to modify

00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:04,700
the colors in your app so right now

00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:04,700
we're using the deep purple built in

00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:11,510
over here the deep purple built in theme

00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:14,580
so we have that deep purple at the top

00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:18,180
and then there's an accent color it's

00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:20,550
like a gold accent color but we want to

00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:22,950
actually use the NASA colors so I pulled

00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:26,580
the NASA primary and secondary colors

00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:28,860
from their website they have like a hook

00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,960
they have their own style guide and I

00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:33,120
put those here so the primary is going

00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,860
to be this hex value and the secondary

00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,730
is going to be this hex value so if I

00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,730
just copy this

00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:52,610
and paste it over here in the primary

00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:58,640
and then I copy the other one and paste

00:49:52,610 --> 00:50:02,930
that over here and we'll just leave the

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:05,420
the warning color as that red then it

00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:07,280
has created this theme so right now it's

00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:10,700
in the dark theme I'm gonna just switch

00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,800
it to the light theme and then all we

00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:15,770
have to do is press this copy angular s

00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,470
CSS button at the top and then it's

00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:22,850
going to the what the website will put

00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:25,520
all the CSS in the paste buffer and if

00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:28,250
you saw the little that little

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,170
notification show up just as

00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:33,080
successfully copied angular CSS to

00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:36,200
clipboard you can also modify the fonts

00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:40,610
if you'd like but this is just a quick

00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:42,410
and easy way to get access to the all of

00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:45,170
the different colors because it's not

00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:46,940
just about picking two colors there's

00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:51,830
kind of a whole bunch of different

00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:53,330
colors and it can be it can be a little

00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:55,220
bit of a challenge to like figure out

00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:57,500
what all those individual colors should

00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:59,300
be so this tool I didn't create this

00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,770
it's not like some official tool it's

00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:05,590
just something that I found that is

00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:08,620
actually very useful so if we pasted it

00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:10,910
we'll have to create an S CSS file and

00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:13,070
there's instructions of course in this

00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:16,040
step so we're gonna create a themed s

00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:20,270
CSS file right next to styles dot CSS

00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:23,780
and then we'll paste all of those styles

00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:27,200
and then you just have to update the

00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:29,240
angular JSON file to also include this

00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,930
new CSS file if you don't update angular

00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:36,590
JSON the the build process isn't gonna

00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:42,710
pull in those CSS styles so I'm just

00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:47,870
gonna show the know what the generated

00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:49,910
code was it has a lot of lines of CSS

00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:50,670
that you can then customize but this is

00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:52,830
a good

00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:54,810
jumping off point to creating your own

00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:57,510
theme so I just wanted to make sure that

00:51:54,810 --> 00:52:00,360
we hit this step so that everyone kind

00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:02,400
of has a foundation for understanding

00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,860
how they can update their own their

00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,170
theme so let's just take a couple of

00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:12,780
minutes to go through that process and

00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:14,400
add the NASA theme to our app leaves I

00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:17,250
just wanted to also point out that

00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:22,590
there's another step that I kind of had

00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:26,100
hidden so if you go up to into code and

00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:29,150
go to the steps and then go to step

00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:31,260
eight there's some like additional

00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:33,420
material that I just wanted to include

00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:35,040
just in case we had extra time which it

00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:41,960
doesn't look like we're gonna have but

00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:41,960
um I can show you what that looks like

00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:05,200
so for the very last bonus step we have

00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:08,710
this floating action button down here at

00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:11,790
the bottom and it has an icon with a

00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:20,470
plus button so we can click on that oh

00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:29,260
cool it doesn't work fail it worked

00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:30,880
locally on my computer hmm yeah I have

00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:34,000
some sort I actually I'm pretty sure I

00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,840
know what the issue is and I will push

00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,560
an update

00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:40,860
oops what why we're doing that Oh Matt

00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,860
deep

00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:55,239
I'm gonna push an update to this but the

00:53:53,319 --> 00:53:58,779
floating action button pops up a dialog

00:53:55,239 --> 00:54:02,380
and it has a form with a few different

00:53:58,779 --> 00:54:04,960
few other form controls and not just the

00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:08,829
input it has a date picker which is the

00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:11,230
problem that I'm having here and also a

00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:14,410
select so you can kind of see a couple

00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:16,809
of other examples and then if you

00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:19,450
there's like the the instructions first

00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:22,930
f8 those like hidden step 8 instructions

00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:24,789
take you step-by-step through wiring all

00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:38,640
that up so I just wanted to point that

00:54:24,789 --> 00:54:38,640
out was there a question hang on

00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:52,349
no I don't add this search isn't

00:54:41,700 --> 00:55:03,690
implemented sorry yeah Oh step 8

00:54:52,349 --> 00:55:08,339
yeah so if you go so this is the general

00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:10,559
github repo if you click on steps then

00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:12,299
there's a hidden step 8 down here

00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:22,190
it just isn't linked to from the other

00:55:12,299 --> 00:55:22,190
steps any other questions

00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:30,089
okay I'm gonna stick around for a few

00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:34,950
more minutes the step six that we

00:55:30,089 --> 00:55:38,250
skipped was just adding that the an icon

00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:39,720
at the top with a map menu and so you

00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:42,480
can kind of see how you can create a

00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,680
menu with some buttons and I just kind

00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:48,960
of mocked out a little logout button

00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:51,570
with with the Matt menu alright well

00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:54,889
thanks for coming everyone

00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:54,889
