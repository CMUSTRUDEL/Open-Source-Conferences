Title: Angular and CSS Grid: Get ready to fall in love | Bill Odom
Publication date: 2019-05-04
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	Quick! How do you feel about CSS?

Yeah, thatâ€™s what I thought. ðŸ™‚ Itâ€™s not unreasonable â€” CSS can seem more like a hindrance than a help, an obstacle to be overcome instead of a tool that enables developers to create great applications.

Itâ€™s time to take another look. A lot of fantastic things have happened with CSS recently, and arguably the most significant of these is the widespread rollout of CSS Grid. Itâ€™s a whole new way to handle layout for web applications, and finally frees us from the misery of floats and the ratâ€™s nest of row/column divs that have infested our HTML templates for far too long.

Perhaps even more importantly, CSS Grid enables us to do things that, until now, were practically impossible (or just ridiculously painful) with HTML and CSS, and all with beautifully clean markup and straightforward, understandable CSS.

In this workshop, weâ€™ll take a lightning tour of CSS Grid and and see how it can make building Angular applications dramatically easier. Along the way, weâ€™ll touch on several other CSS capabilities (some recent, and some just tragically underappreciated), show how to use them in combination with Angular and CSS Grid, and demonstrate the amazing capabilities that these combinations unlock.

Angular is fantastic, CSS Grid is fantastic, and the two together? Unbeatable. Really, youâ€™re gonna love it. ðŸ™‚

[Music]

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,640
hi everybody normally I do this in

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,750
groups of say ten to twenty five at a

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,180
time so this is a little different

00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:27,390
let me flip over really quick to

00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:31,619
something other than the ad everybody

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,149
able to see that good alright

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,340
so really quickly a little bit of intro

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,480
Eric was asking earlier so how do you

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,980
want you how do you want me to describe

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,809
like what you do and who you do it for

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,100
and things like that and I said you know

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,140
I'd really rather you just stick with

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,329
what you personally know about me and

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,100
then I'll do the the intro so Eric left

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,829
out part of the the origin story which

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,840
is oh what a few weeks months ahead of

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,050
the first the coming-out party for stack

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,309
blitz you and I met in California and I

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,469
told him he was doing everything wrong

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,629
in his life

00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:04,260
apparently I was wrong he seems to do it

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:07,799
okay alright so what is it that that I

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,010
do with most of my free time well if I

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,590
look familiar it may be because of this

00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,030
anybody ever seen this website yes thank

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,439
you Lance

00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,110
also an instructor for angular bootcamp

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:22,290
so yeah if you look very very closely

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:27,119
back there you can see you can see me

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:29,490
there I am look at that the nice people

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,079
who run angular bootcamp are always

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,700
alright our Oasis digital you've

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,159
probably seen the sponsor booth out

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,960
there and they did that without telling

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,390
me that I was going to be the face the

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,310
international model for for angular boot

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,390
camp and it does cause some interesting

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,189
interactions in the hallways because

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,220
people often know me and have no idea

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,290
why they're like I googled angular one

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,009
time and that face followed me all over

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:55,680
the web so yes if you have searched for

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,810
angular I've probably shown up in a

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,030
picture in your browser

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,899
hopefully not adjacent anything terribly

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,719
embarrassing so a little bit of a

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,819
background here I'm primarily known

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,039
these days anyway for angular angular

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,410
development angular training so I split

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,600
my time between being this guy

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,270
doing angular training but also being a

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,840
working you know consultant technical

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:24,240
architect guy who writes software for

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,530
for big companies so don't doing the

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,130
work that a lot of the folks in the room

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:32,970
I'm sure also do so what am I giving a

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:35,430
talk primarily about CSS well a couple

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,400
years ago with the nice folks at Oasis

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,980
digital I ended up on a project that was

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,160
kind of this dream combination of

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,560
factors all of us who've been doing this

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,060
for a while you you've had the same

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,770
problem over and over again undoubtedly

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,900
it's like well we need you to do the

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,900
impossible and it has to work in ie6

00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,170
yeah all the gray came from somewhere

00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,850
but this project it was a little bit

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,490
weird you know I'm the guy kind of

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,170
brokering the deal talking with the

00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,550
client liaison and I'm like all right I

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,000
need to understand the the basic

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:14,550
requirements of your of your application

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,490
first of all what browsers do you need

00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:20,190
to support and the answer was and I'm

00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,330
not joking it's gonna take us what about

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,860
a year to put this together and what

00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,750
yeah probably so this is a really big

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,160
projects like whatever version of Chrome

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,930
is current then I'm like a Papa he's

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,820
like yeah whatever the latest version of

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,470
chrome is at the time the thing actually

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,910
goes to production it's cool that's the

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,910
only one we need to support so whatever

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:43,050
you think chrome will be capable of in

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:45,780
2018 we're good like I love you you're

00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,340
the best client ever and they haven't

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,500
gone back on it they've actually stuck

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,540
with that so an interesting thing

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,590
happened because of that particular

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,980
requirement or lack of a requirement we

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,600
were able to like live in the future

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,760
there was no well make sure it works in

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,770
ie9 or doesn't even make sure it works

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,550
in I eleven wasn't even make sure it

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:10,590
works in edge it was chrome from the

00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:14,370
future as long as you have that we're

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,660
good all right second part of the origin

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,630
story why I'm here in front of you

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,450
talking about CSS one of the least

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,890
favorite things to me about web

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,770
development even modern web development

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,900
has always been the lack of a good

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,580
layout system

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,640
now what I mean by that well if you go

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:35,490
way back in time to like the very early

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,010
days of the web probably quite literally

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:42,000
earlier than some of you were alive

00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:43,290
we had things like this creating killer

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,720
websites anybody here ever heard of

00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,700
David Siegel and hi-5 and creating

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,440
killer websites I'm seeing nothing but

00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,860
blank stares that does not surprise me

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,630
but at the time we're talking 1995 or

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,970
thereabouts when the web was really

00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,390
becoming the web something for people

00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,620
other than physicists and nerds to use

00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,630
you had things like creighton killer

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:09,030
websites and hi-5 websites and this is

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:12,600
the dude that created and/or popularized

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:14,970
two very very popular techniques at the

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:20,520
time one of them was table-based layouts

00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:22,410
as in table tags and T ARS and T DS who

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,510
here is done table based layout in their

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,680
application okay finally see I'm getting

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,530
to the point where it's relevant your

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,040
life who here loves table based layout

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:34,890
nobody raise your hand but even before

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,980
that we had said I should have it pulled

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:41,520
up here we had pixel shims anybody

00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,620
remember spacer gifts one by one

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,240
invisible gifts and the reason that we

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,750
had them was so we could move crap

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,320
around on the page it's amazing

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,370
anything ever worked at all but we did

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,560
this and we did this for a long time

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,910
David Siegel the killer websites guy he

00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,620
was one of the folks who either created

00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,990
or popularized this technique and I

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,780
built a bunch of websites this way but I

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,640
never liked it

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,050
no right-thinking person ever did it was

00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,630
one of those things where we don't have

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,640
anything better so this is what we're

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,450
gonna have to do with ourselves and it

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,860
was awful

00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:15,450
I'm not gonna go too deep into it but

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,000
you need to understand the way that it

00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:24,000
works was by you actually having small

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,430
gifts or gifs I don't care that let you

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,860
put space on either side of them with

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,590
like eight space and v-space attributes

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,900
so that you could literally move things

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,960
to a particular place on a webpage and

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,700
if this sounds absolutely bonkers you

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,330
are not

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,040
wrong but then then a wonderful thing

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,830
happened

00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:49,370
Internet Explorer 3 everybody's like

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:51,590
what Internet Explorer 3 is the first

00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:54,110
place anyway that I encountered CSS

00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,600
cascading stylesheets and it was the

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,040
thing that would save us all it didn't

00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,880
but it was supposed to be the thing that

00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,820
would save us all

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,520
it finally let us start going toward the

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:08,150
true promise of the love of the original

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,610
web which was just just give us content

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:14,960
mark it up with things like paragraph

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:18,320
tags and h1s and h2s and just just let

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,770
it be what it is and somewhere else some

00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,310
other magical place we're going to put

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,870
the styling information and that was CSS

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:30,020
so no longer did we have things like

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:33,620
font tags to worry about or the blink

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:37,190
tag we were able to like have true

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,330
semantic HTML and style all that stuff

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,610
in some other place but all that

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:43,580
cosmetics aesthetics all that stuff

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,740
somewhere else and while it didn't

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,600
really work entirely the way that we

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,430
wanted to it was at least a giant step

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,920
in the right direction but one of the

00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,990
things that was missing and continued to

00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,740
be missing until literally just a couple

00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,580
of years ago was a true layout system

00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,810
now a lot of people in the room if

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,090
you've got any familiarity with the ways

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,020
that we've done layout in HTML CSS in

00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,090
other words the way we've made the

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,890
browser like show what we want to show

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,170
the way we want to show it you're

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,730
probably thinking whoa wait a minute

00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,560
we've had things like bootstrap and and

00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,090
foundation and lots of other CSS

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,040
frameworks they were clearly able to do

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:20,390
some sort of layout for us

00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:23,180
we had flexbox we even had tables they

00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:25,340
were awful but they worked in fact there

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,870
was a time when CSS wasn't doing what I

00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,600
was supposed to do and we had websites

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,190
like give up and use tables com don't go

00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,100
there it's it's a it's not what it used

00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:36,410
to be so this is on archive.org and if

00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,670
you read it it's fantastic it's like you

00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,500
know we've all been there we want to

00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:42,170
make it work with CSS so here is a timer

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,060
you can use as you struggle with CSS and

00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:46,520
when you finally get frustrated you're

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,940
officially allowed to stop give up and

00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,100
use tables I sent this to a lot of

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,509
clients

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:55,699
times are different now times have

00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:57,379
changed and they are so much better than

00:08:55,699 --> 00:09:00,319
they used to be a couple of years ago

00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:01,730
after flexbox had become a thing that

00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:02,839
people could use and liked and I love

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,720
flex bucks don't get me wrong I'm not

00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:08,420
this is not a bash flex flex box session

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,740
but after flex box had become a thing

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,000
and people realized wow this is an

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,370
improvement but it is not everything

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,720
that we needed CSS grid came along and

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,730
one of the wonderful things about CSS

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,850
grid is the way that it was deployed to

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:26,810
evergreen browsers so within the space

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:31,009
of about a month Chrome Firefox and edge

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:34,699
and all the mobile browsers gained CSS

00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:37,399
grid capabilities and that was early

00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,329
2017 first quarter of 2017 and it

00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,000
happened pretty much simultaneously

00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:41,839
across all these browsers so like I said

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,399
they learned some things from the

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,199
flexbox rollout if you were a few years

00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,329
earlier where it had been a very

00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:48,740
staggered release individual browsers

00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:50,089
had gotten it at different times and

00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,560
some of those browsers has gotten one

00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,060
version and some gotten a slightly

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,370
different version in fact we still see

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,500
holdovers of that today as we have

00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,759
libraries that live on top of our Flex

00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,649
implementations and tools like

00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:02,600
autoprefixer in order to make flex

00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:04,370
really look the same across to all the

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,630
browsers and again I'm not bashing on

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,220
flex it's just

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,630
they kind of botched the rollout a

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,680
little bit and even the people who did

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,540
it they're like yeah we should have done

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,810
a better job of that and they did with

00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:17,660
CSS grid with grid in the space of a

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:21,709
month early 2017 everybody got the same

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:23,990
grid more to the point for the previous

00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:26,600
four or so years grid had already

00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,279
existed behind a feature flag or behind

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,509
some sort of flag inside the browser

00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,310
that said you know if you want to try

00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:31,990
this you can turn it on but you have to

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,069
turn it on

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,740
in order to be able to play with it and

00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:38,509
people did for years they really

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,430
hammered on grid which meant that when

00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:41,899
it really got turned on for all of us to

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,540
use in production web sites for real

00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:48,980
clients it worked and it worked really

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:51,470
really well so all of this lined up very

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,059
very nicely with my magical dream client

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,699
that's like yeah just use whatever's

00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:57,769
current grid showed up at the point that

00:10:55,699 --> 00:11:01,410
I needed it most in my life and I fell

00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:04,739
in love hence the name of the talk

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:08,849
because for the first time in a browser

00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:10,889
you can do true layout no hacking two

00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:12,660
dimensions rows and columns without

00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:15,329
having a bunch of extra stuff polluting

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,189
your markup so what we're going to do in

00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:18,929
this particular presentation this were

00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:20,759
two set of workshops is we're gonna go

00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,289
through what grid looks like what

00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:24,239
actually takes to use it what it is is

00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:25,949
to use it well and then a lot of

00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:28,079
examples that are gonna build up from

00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:29,549
kind of small ideas to bigger and bigger

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,049
and more complicated things that will be

00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:33,479
closer to what you would use in a real

00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:35,579
application but Before we jump into that

00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:37,289
I've asked a few questions about who is

00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:40,979
used what in the past who here has used

00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:44,339
CSS grid already how do you feel about

00:11:40,979 --> 00:11:47,489
it be honest is one of the things that I

00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:49,799
have found is that people often

00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:51,509
encounter grid and they have people like

00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,639
me going it's the greatest thing ever

00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:56,429
you're just it's it's finally arrived

00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,049
and they get into it and about 20

00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:59,369
minutes later like you know no I don't

00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:01,139
get it I know I don't get what the big

00:11:59,369 --> 00:12:03,720
excitement was this seems really painful

00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:05,519
this this seems complicated i I know

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,979
flex I had to learn flex and all of its

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,809
weirdness I'm good I don't need another

00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:11,519
thing that seems to cover a lot of the

00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:15,419
same territories flex but with a

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,209
different syntax and also it feels a lot

00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:20,639
like table layout but without the table

00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:22,229
markup and although people present that

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,429
as an advantage sometimes that feels a

00:12:22,229 --> 00:12:25,649
little bit weird you're like I'm having

00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:28,679
to detach these two important ideas like

00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:30,479
my markup and the layout for my for my

00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:33,269
markup and I don't quite know how to

00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:34,859
connect the reconnect these dots we're

00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:38,850
gonna solve that problem in this in this

00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:40,169
talk alright so before I jump into the

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,109
next section there's the thing I want

00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:45,239
you to do and I want you to go to github

00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:46,679
I'm going to preemptively apologize

00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:48,359
because I realized after I did this I

00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:53,489
included like a hundred megabytes of

00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:57,869
images so good luck Internet on my

00:12:53,489 --> 00:13:03,599
github there should be a thing under the

00:12:57,869 --> 00:13:05,959
repositories called space walk if I can

00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:05,959
find it

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:14,620
I promise it's out there oh it would

00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:16,980
help if I made it public I apologize one

00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,980
moment please

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,070
you guys get to see the big warning that

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,240
says are you really sure you want to do

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,140
this there's probably all sorts stuff in

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,070
there you don't ever want to give away

00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:42,230
sure

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:44,600
and settings there we go make this

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,310
repository public oh dear God are you

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,340
sure type the name of the repository yes

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:51,340
I'm totally sure Oh God

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:58,820
worked on my machine the really cool

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,350
thing is is Eric sitting in the front

00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:04,370
row so when this inevitably has trouble

00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:07,700
with stack blitz I'm like Eric okay now

00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:09,800
there should be on my github a thing

00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,360
that you can get to called space walk

00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,890
and that's the application that I'm

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,710
going to be using to demonstrate all

00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:19,010
this stuff and to do the workshops now

00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:21,800
this application is a big angular app

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,810
and all the examples are components

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,790
within this angular application I've

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:28,400
done this quite deliberately so first of

00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:31,730
all go there clone this repo it's an

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,040
angular CLI project npm install and then

00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,260
wait but go ahead and get that running

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,140
and we'll see how we do it's gonna pull

00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,210
down not only the code for this but the

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,610
typical 700 gigabytes of dependencies

00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,170
and then once it's up and once that's

00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,400
done you should be able to npm start and

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:51,440
see exactly what you're seeing on my

00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:56,120
screen alright so this application is

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,980
built in kind of a weird way I have

00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,520
deliberately made it so there is no sort

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:04,490
of application shell in other words if I

00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,740
go to like this menu which we're gonna

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,390
see a lot of in here notice there's no

00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,500
header at the top that says I'll click

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,120
here to go back to the home page there's

00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,950
no footer at the bottom and the reason I

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,240
did that is because I want every one of

00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,650
these individual examples to be

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,260
something that could effectively stand

00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,370
alone which means to CSS that you're

00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,410
going to see while it's all real and

00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,210
while it all works is sometimes like

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,890
gonna be duplicated across a lot of

00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:27,590
different examples in a real application

00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,790
I would extract all that stuff to some

00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,680
sort of set you know set of global

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,940
styles and a bunch of CSS properties but

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,380
I've deliberately kept each one of these

00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,090
examples as something that you could

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,980
effectively pick up and extract to its

00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,210
own thing and use independently and

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,470
hopefully that will make it easier if

00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,490
you not have to look in 17 different

00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,630
places to see what

00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,029
is that I'm actually trying to

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,370
accomplish there now since I don't have

00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:48,980
a header and I don't have any place I

00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,470
can easily click to go anywhere there

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,550
are some keystrokes that I put in place

00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:55,940
what's what's the old joke about you

00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:57,620
know any any real application over time

00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,320
eventually grows to the ability to like

00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,360
send email well any time you're trying

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,279
to avoid using a slide package in a

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,750
presentation you gradually build most of

00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,320
a slide package in your presentation

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:11,360
that's what I've done here I have a

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,950
keystroke that will take me to this menu

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,450
I have another keystroke that'll take me

00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:19,010
back to the welcome screen I have

00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:23,480
keystrokes that will take me across

00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:24,740
different examples you'll see those in

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,060
the code for the route component if you

00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,610
really want to see them it's back slash

00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,750
its back tick and it's the square

00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,130
brackets if you want to move around the

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,420
same way that I'm moving around but I'm

00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,620
explaining all this to you not because

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,420
it's super important to understand about

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,770
CSS grid but so that you'll understand

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,390
kind of the weird structure of this

00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,520
particular application it's done that

00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,140
way deliberately so that we'll have all

00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,970
of the space to play with on each

00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,050
individual page I'm gonna go a little

00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,250
bit more into the structure of the

00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,540
application in just a second but I

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,800
wanted you to understand that so anybody

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,300
that actually is fortunate enough to get

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,410
the whole damn thing download it and get

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,160
it running you'll understand how to move

00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:56,990
around inside of it

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,970
alright other things about this

00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,440
particular application like I said it's

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,180
an angular app because this is a

00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,410
combination of angular and CSS grid

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,970
things but kind of gonna be really

00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,010
upfront with you this is mostly about

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,050
CSS grid I want the techniques that we

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,140
talked about here today to be something

00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:14,929
that you can pick up and use in any web

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,400
application in any web document for that

00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:17,630
matter in fact several of the examples

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,850
that we have are really going to be more

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,439
document oriented just to explain some

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,870
of these important CSS grid techniques

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,670
without all of the superstructure of an

00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,140
application wrapped around it I'm not

00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,000
going to shy away from using angular

00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,710
when it's when it makes sense so for

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,760
example in some of these things here

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,100
like these divs

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,770
I don't literally have nine divs on a

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,870
page I use our friend in g4 to generate

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,610
a bunch of divs but apart from that not

00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:45,380
super complicated angular code here

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:50,780
that's the idea okay how are we doing on

00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:52,190
the download Dara even asked 71% it's

00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,660
two digits that's more than I was

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:58,100
expecting by this point frankly

00:17:53,660 --> 00:18:00,080
I'll take it all right so here in our

00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,670
main menu we've got lots of different

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,840
examples that are deliberately named so

00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,950
as not to give things away

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,530
feel free to poke around on the source

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:11,750
code if you want to but otherwise I can

00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:14,240
unfold them as we go first thing I want

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,700
to show you is deliberately called the

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,050
best feature ever so what do you think

00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,050
I'm demonstrating here on this page

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:26,840
centering oh my god we can finally

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,630
Center things without a whole lot of

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,170
pain and anguish in in HTML and yes I'm

00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:35,240
making a joke but not really it was

00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,320
really really hard to Center things for

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,030
a long time and not only are we

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,410
centering something horizontally we're

00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:42,470
centering things vertically so if I come

00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:44,960
in here and I grab the corner I can

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,630
actually like keep this thing really

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,350
centered wherever I happen to be on this

00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,370
particular page the satellite by the way

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,390
this thing I'm centering the plane at

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,060
the background it's staying right where

00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:58,340
it's supposed to be so let's take a look

00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:04,310
at some code just kind of set the tone

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:06,170
here by the way I'm a vim user you don't

00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:09,130
have to be of M user to be a CSS grid

00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:14,420
unless you want to be a good person okay

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:15,710
all right so way down in here you get an

00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,910
overview of the structure of the code

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,200
we're going to be jumping around on all

00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,960
these examples there's a handful of

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,340
additional components that we're using

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,500
we have that menu that I talked about

00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,930
just a moment ago so you know here is

00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,820
our app component HTML which we're gonna

00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:32,000
route to individual things so this is a

00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:34,250
pretty standard angular application from

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,990
the perspective of angular code the only

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,820
thing that's really weird is again us

00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,770
taking over the entire viewport for the

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,330
individual examples you'll see lots and

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,550
lots of application as you go and it

00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:47,150
will not there's nothing in here that

00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:48,740
will be surprising deliberately so all

00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:51,080
right so we were talking about centering

00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,540
well that's our example for centering in

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,110
fact you can see if you look in the

00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:58,430
route that the route name and the

00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,720
component name that we're looking at are

00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,190
always going to match up that'll make it

00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,910
really really easy for you to follow on

00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:07,250
the code so here's what it takes to do

00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,560
this first of all the angular components

00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,570
so

00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,860
couldn't be simpler well technically it

00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,380
could I could get it rid of that static

00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,820
label but other than that it is a really

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,590
really simple angular component we're

00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,590
basically just using it for its template

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:28,440
here's the whole template literally just

00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:29,790
an image and nothing else and just just

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,770
so you just so you're really clear about

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,630
this I'm not doing anything outside of

00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:37,560
this component that would Center this

00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:42,360
thing on the page all of the centering

00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:46,200
is happening here in this CSS the only

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,850
really important parts in here are the

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,060
display grid we bump this up so you can

00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:53,130
see it deliberately setting the height

00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,390
of this to be a hundred percent of the

00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,790
viewport height and if you haven't seen

00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,390
viewport units before you gotta love

00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,560
them they're awesome

00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:03,960
and then this thing place items : Center

00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,370
it's a little shorthand that says I

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,530
would like it to be horizontally and

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,970
vertically centered please in whatever

00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,730
container I happened to be in put it

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,860
right in the middle I can specify those

00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:18,300
separately if I want to with a line

00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:19,620
items and justify items people are

00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,820
always like which one is which I can

00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,320
never remember if you can remember how

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,240
to use a word processor and you remember

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,210
what the justify button does let you

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,820
justify right or justify right just if I

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,800
left justify Center that's what justify

00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,840
items does for you inside of a grid

00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,730
context which is what we've done we've

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,260
said we want to be display grid and we

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,900
want to place items in the center which

00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:43,110
means align and justify the items right

00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,430
in the middle now again I'm kind of

00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,520
making a joke here because centering has

00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:48,870
been a pain for a long long time but

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,850
this is super useful to know and it

00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:55,170
begins to give us a little bit of a clue

00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:57,210
as to how CSS grid actually works you've

00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:59,040
probably seen lots of display :

00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:02,310
something in CSS before the most common

00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,840
ones by far our block and inline and if

00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:06,240
you think about them as like what div

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,430
does and what span does that's block and

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,750
inline display grid is a new one of

00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,800
these things and there's lots of them

00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,540
but display grid is the one that we're

00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,480
going to see most often today and it

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:18,450
says I want the stuff inside of this

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,610
particular thing to be displayed as a

00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,670
grid

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:24,530
now what is this particular thing this

00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:26,750
part might be a little bit surprising :

00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:28,670
host I don't know how familiar people

00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,960
are with angular's view encapsulation

00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,400
frankly one of the most wonderful

00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,370
features of angular that you get for

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,490
free right out of the box : host is a

00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:38,330
way of saying I'm inside of an oven I'm

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,280
an element

00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,080
one of those fake elements that we use

00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,360
in order to create components I want to

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,170
reach outside and grab ahold of that

00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,890
element and style some stuff about it I

00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,420
see a again

00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,130
I teach angular bootcamp I see people

00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,420
all the time the very first thing they

00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,160
do inside of one of their custom

00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,330
components is they put a div because

00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,460
they're like I'm gonna need a div to

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,110
hold all the stuff together inside you

00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,180
already have one of those things to hold

00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:06,320
the stuff together it is the element

00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:09,950
that you created via the selector so we

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,560
have an element it's the example

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:17,630
centering element if we look inside of

00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:19,880
the Dom just take a look at this guy

00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,800
you'll actually be able to see there's

00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,960
our example centering element right

00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,600
underneath the router outlet so there's

00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,220
no need for an extra div but sometimes

00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,480
you want that extra div or the

00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,710
equivalent of that extra div in order to

00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,000
be able to style the thing that you're

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:36,770
sitting inside of and that's exactly

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,290
what : host does for you so if we come

00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:41,330
in here and look you can see we've said

00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:45,290
that we would like our angular element

00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,670
to be display grid this alone is gonna

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,990
save you a tag on every element that you

00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,820
create from this every component you

00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,500
create from this point forward and that

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,510
furthermore not only do we want reduce

00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,660
these B display grid we want to take up

00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:58,490
100% of the viewport height we want the

00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,920
whole thing I could change this if I

00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:03,880
want I said you know this really needs

00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:08,120
to only be 70% of the viewport height

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:11,440
after angular recompiles all my code we

00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,670
end up with 70% of the viewport height

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,110
and I could furthermore move that around

00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,120
as well if I wanted to with other

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,650
centering and alignment commands but

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,660
just kind of showing off what viewport

00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,030
units are doing for you in combination

00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:25,310
with display colon grid and notice we're

00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,320
still dead in the center of the thing

00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:29,960
that we said not only takes up 70% of

00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,910
the height of the viewport so far so

00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,350
good

00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:36,430
what else we got going on here

00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:40,000
everything else is just sizzle I'm gonna

00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:41,530
put this back 200 I've said that I want

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,620
my background image to look like a

00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:46,450
planet this has nothing to be with grid

00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,670
but it gives you some cool CSS stuff to

00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:51,010
take home and show off we've said that

00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:52,270
we want a radial gradient gradient it's

00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,860
going to be circular and it's going to

00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,480
go through several different colors in

00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,720
order to make it look like it's actually

00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,300
a planet and then behind the whole thing

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,310
there's gonna be a star field that's

00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,930
where we get this star field and the

00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:07,480
thing that looks like a planet so the

00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:09,640
only thing that's on this on this page

00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,860
that's on the HTML element is the image

00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,580
and it's all happening inside of our

00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:18,040
example centering component so you get

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,590
the idea so far anything completely

00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,290
bizarre and broken that you don't get

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:29,490
how we doing on the download anybody

00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:33,790
still working on it I I heard something

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:34,990
90% oh we gave people false hope and

00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:38,080
then they took advantage of it and now

00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:43,390
now we wait all right but but it's still

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:45,520
moving right okay cool um someone hey

00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,860
Erik someone should try to see if that

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:54,460
reefer works on stackless it does not

00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:56,790
okay okay in others in my console must

00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:02,200
be stacked let's just fall

00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:04,690
remember I'm wise you can't argue all

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,460
right so now that we've learned how to

00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,960
center and along the way of learning how

00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:10,900
to center we've learned a little bit

00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,640
about how we have to turn on grid let's

00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,560
make things a little more complicated

00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,450
notice in here all we did was say

00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,630
display grid we didn't define any rows

00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:21,100
or columns or grid template anything we

00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,810
didn't define anything except the

00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,640
display we said we want this thing to be

00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,990
grid and that already gave us some super

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,340
powers the ability to like position

00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,460
things horizontally and vertically right

00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,010
in the center of the of the component

00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:36,520
but let's make it a little more exciting

00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:38,860
so if I use my back slash to go back

00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,180
here I'm actually gonna skip briefly

00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,560
over the some assembly required because

00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,160
I want to use that one as a source for

00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,960
workshop and go to playing with blocks

00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,520
and before I move on I should mention

00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,990
there's a good chance we're not going to

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,430
get through all this stuff and I made a

00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,230
command decision that we that we make in

00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,730
our classes as well I'd rather leave you

00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,340
with more than we have time for

00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:58,680
then artificially end early so if I skip

00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,660
around don't be surprised if I skip over

00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,640
entirely don't be surprised either I

00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,380
want to use the two hours effectively

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,150
but that may mean we don't get to

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,400
everything that's totally cool you can

00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:13,920
take it home play with it all right

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:15,360
so playing with blocks this is actually

00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,970
taking more advantage of grid than we

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,860
were before I can tell you this is nine

00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,330
divs with a little bit of styling in

00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,440
order to make them show up on the page

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:28,800
and the code is not super complicated

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:30,810
here in our example blocks again pretty

00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,870
simple component let me back off a

00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:35,460
little so you can see the whole thing

00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:37,890
the only complicated bit is that we're

00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,570
building an array of labels so I'm

00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:42,300
deliberately saying you know give me a

00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:45,990
string array and then long as we've got

00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:48,390
less than ten of these things push the

00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,370
number as a string onto this array of

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,740
labels so we end up with the string 1

00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:55,700
the string to the string 3 and then we

00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:59,370
immediately turn around and use that in

00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,990
our template so again this is about the

00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,420
most complicated angular you're going to

00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,640
see in here hopefully it all makes sense

00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,680
we're saying give us one div for every

00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,770
one of the labels inside that that array

00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,870
of labels and then set the title of that

00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:15,270
div to whatever the label is that we

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:17,400
generated title is not an angular thing

00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,540
titles built in HTML nobody ever really

00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,950
knows what to do with it so I'm like

00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,950
great that's exactly what I need gonna

00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,270
stick it on each one of these dips and

00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,910
then you can see the label inside the

00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:28,440
div itself you probably see how this is

00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:31,380
already shaping up each one of these

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,640
divs now has a 1 a 2 a 3 etc inside of

00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,680
it makes it really easy to see where

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,240
they are on the page but the real magic

00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:40,170
is happening inside the CSS like said a

00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,680
lot more going on

00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:44,580
so using that colon host selector so

00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,350
that we don't have to have like a

00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,930
wrapper div around the whole thing we

00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:51,660
can simply say grab me grab the element

00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:54,570
that I'm sitting inside of and make it

00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,160
display grid also give a little bit of

00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,050
padding because if I didn't have that

00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,450
padding remember I say

00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:04,110
every one of these individual examples

00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:06,150
is deliberately like completely stark

00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,840
there's almost no extra styling that we

00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,030
don't need

00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,880
so everything's quite plain including

00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,750
padding including margins and the reason

00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,520
that I do that it's going to become a

00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:17,640
lot clearer later when I start taking

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,620
over the entire viewport so I don't want

00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,600
there to be any externally applied

00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,130
styling that says Oh put something in

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,020
the middle of the screen or put a you

00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,460
know put margins around it I really want

00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,040
every one of my individual examples to

00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:32,730
be able to take over the entire page the

00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,230
entire screen but in this particular

00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,820
example I did want there to be a little

00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,880
bit of breathing room around it so now

00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,020
I've got an element to display grid it's

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,210
got a little bit of padding around it

00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,770
but I'm beginning to take advantage of

00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:46,470
some of the things I can define about a

00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:49,460
grid I've said that this particular grid

00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:52,830
is going to have 5 100 pixel columns I

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:56,010
could have done it like this on under

00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:59,970
pixels 100 pixels 100 pixels but life is

00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:03,150
way too short so instead grid gives us

00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:06,480
this really handy repeat CSS function

00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:09,000
can you guess what it does five times

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,800
give me 100 pixels this doesn't exist

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,760
currently outside of grid but it's so

00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,560
handy that expect it to start being in

00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,300
other parts of CSS one of the cool

00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,730
things about grid and flex before it is

00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,680
they both brought so many nifty things

00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,720
into CSS that it turns out would be

00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,790
really useful in other parts of CSS that

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,740
they're gradually leaking out of CSS

00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,760
grid and flexbox repeats one of those

00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,560
things that you're probably going to see

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,870
over the next couple years begin to show

00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:37,560
up in other places all right so we've

00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:38,970
said we want 5 columns and we also want

00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,350
5 rows now that's a little bit

00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:45,480
surprising because we don't have 5 rows

00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:46,920
but that's fine just because we don't

00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,990
happen to have enough elements to fill

00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,570
up five rows doesn't mean we can't have

00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:54,180
five rows of the grid available to us if

00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:56,460
we need it in fact if I came in here and

00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:57,960
went back to my type script and really

00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:01,980
wanted to get crazy and say you know

00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,500
give me give me up to 20 I come back

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:08,580
here and wait forever and eventually

00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:10,990
look at that as add as I add more divs

00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:14,440
the grid just keeps working

00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:16,630
so I've got 5x5 available to me and I

00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:21,029
filled up 19 of those available slots

00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,029
out of the 25 so far so good

00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:27,909
continuing on everything else in here is

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,730
mostly cosmetic but if you notice there

00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:34,809
is one cool thing each one of the dibs

00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:36,010
is also marked display grid why because

00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,350
I want to be able to Center my number

00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:41,710
that's all I really did there is no

00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:42,909
additional rows columns anything inside

00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,110
here I just wanted to make sure my

00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:46,149
number would show up in the center so I

00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:49,029
said display grid just for the ability

00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:51,270
to get the one in the middle and the 17

00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:54,370
in the middle and that's totally fine

00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:58,270
the cool thing about it is it shows you

00:31:54,370 --> 00:32:01,169
that it's perfectly OK in fact strongly

00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:04,510
encouraged for you to nest CSS grid

00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:06,370
arbitrarily now those of you who are old

00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,510
bootstrap jockeys the way that I am you

00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,610
can probably remember how much fun it

00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:12,640
was to like try to nest bootstrap

00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:14,289
layouts within each other you could sort

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,070
of make it work but don't breathe on it

00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:19,330
don't get too close I always felt like

00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,549
you know those old speakers and if you

00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:23,080
get really close to them they go that's

00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:24,610
what a bootstrap nested layout I always

00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,620
felt like to me it's like as long as I

00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,270
don't look too closely it'll be fine

00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,700
that is not anything you have to worry

00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:32,169
about in CSS grid at all CSS grid you

00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,289
can have grids inside of grids inside of

00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:36,399
grids all the way down and that's

00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:38,169
exactly all we're doing here we're

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,590
saying we've got a main grid that lays

00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:43,200
out our overall you know view and then

00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:46,510
inside of it lots of little grids so

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,610
here on the screen we've got 20 grids

00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:51,820
going on the main grid that holds all of

00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:54,549
them and the 19 individual grids for the

00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,649
for the divs that alone is pretty handy

00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:58,149
and they could get as complicated as we

00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:59,740
want internally there's no limitation

00:32:58,149 --> 00:33:00,820
like well if you define rows and columns

00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,440
outside you can't define rows and

00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:04,059
columns inside no you're totally able to

00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,640
do that and we'll see examples of that

00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:10,240
later on

00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:13,440
everything else cosmetics want to make

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,600
the font slightly bigger want to make it

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,130
have a green border wanna make rounded

00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,480
corners because we live in the post jobs

00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,090
error and nothing can have square

00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,870
corners anymore

00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:26,730
everything else in here is just

00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,730
aesthetics if I took it away

00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,990
in fact I'll take away this part as well

00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:35,050
I'll just leave the border so you can

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:38,190
actually see the divs themselves it all

00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:39,970
still works everything's great

00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:43,600
doesn't Leigh do an interesting question

00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:44,830
though kind of like you know tree falls

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,780
in the forest no one's there to hear it

00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:48,940
does make any sound if you define a grid

00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:54,430
you don't put anything in it what does

00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:57,370
it look like I think it looks like let's

00:33:54,430 --> 00:34:00,240
find out now my template is completely

00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:05,920
empty and wait for the magic to happen

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:07,030
keep waiting nothing why would I bother

00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,100
showing you this of course there's

00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:12,880
nothing there it's actually an important

00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:16,450
but subtle point grid is not an HTML

00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:20,590
construct grid doesn't really exist in

00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:23,290
HTML it's there like a force field there

00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:24,940
has no visual representation in fact

00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:27,610
even though grid is a thing that occurs

00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,899
inside of CSS there are no styling rules

00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:32,290
for grids

00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:34,330
you can't put a border on a grid you

00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:36,100
can't say I would like to style the gap

00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:37,510
between elements in a certain way this

00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,860
leads to lots of frustration people

00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,540
really like to be able to do this and I

00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:43,659
kind of expected eventually it will show

00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:45,790
up but as of today grids themselves have

00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:48,220
no appearance until you start putting

00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:50,860
things inside of them and at this point

00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:52,360
anyway that's a feature not a bug so if

00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,740
you ever find yourself going well I I

00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,510
don't see my grid well yeah you don't

00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,340
see the grid you see the things in the

00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,400
grid when you put them in place that's

00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:03,220
when the grid begins to show up but

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,860
there's a trick if we go in here and

00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:09,430
inspect this guy take a look at the

00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:15,880
elements you'll actually be able to see

00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:17,230
we do have our example blocks element

00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,420
and as soon as I hover over to the dev

00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:20,770
tools sure enough there is a grid there

00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,450
it's just waiting for elements to be

00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:24,130
inside of it now I'm in the chrome dev

00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:26,200
tools to be able to see this and you get

00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,420
the basic structure beside the chrome

00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,620
dev tools now we can actually see all 25

00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,810
of the places that we could put

00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:33,100
something but we don't have a lot of

00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:36,010
other information

00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,900
chrome is coming along in terms of its

00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,910
grid capabilities its grid tooling but

00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,010
it's not nearly as far along as

00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,840
Firefox's so I'm going to take this

00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:48,670
example that we've got flip over to

00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:52,450
Firefox and visit our playing with

00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:55,210
blocks example again and now I can hover

00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:56,770
over this and see much the same thing

00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,090
that we saw just a moment ago I don't

00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:00,150
have enough screen space can you tell

00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:03,130
I'm not on my big monitor at home

00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:05,020
there's my example blocks but I don't

00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,490
really see much going on in Firefox

00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,050
well Billy you just lied to us you said

00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,760
Firefox is really cool when it came to

00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:12,670
grid help but but it'd look better in

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:17,230
chrome well you can ask for more help if

00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:21,130
you look down here we've got a little

00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:24,070
grid panel Firefox has a dedicated grid

00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:26,500
panel where you can say I want to turn

00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:27,640
on an overlay for that grid in fact I

00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,020
want to turn it on and I want to make

00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,390
sure I can really see it so I'm going to

00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,670
turn on the lines so it's very very

00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:36,430
visible so now not only do I get an

00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:38,740
overview of the grid but I get numbers

00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:42,460
for all of those things as well so the

00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:44,140
topmost line is number one if i zoom in

00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:48,340
a bit you can actually see there's my

00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:52,600
one two three four and it goes down as

00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:54,850
well 1 2 3 etc I got lots of things that

00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,140
I can turn on if I wanted to if I had

00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:57,910
area names which we haven't talked about

00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,590
yet I could turn those on I can extend

00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:01,180
the lines out infinitely so if I had a

00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:03,580
grid that was like partially off screen

00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:05,530
or even entirely off screen I could say

00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:07,420
extend the line so I can actually see

00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:10,000
where the grid would be if I could if I

00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:11,530
could see it off the screen great tools

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,750
and you really really should get used to

00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:15,730
them this this gave me a reason even

00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:17,020
before Firefox like completely redid

00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,940
their engine and got really fast and

00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:20,920
relevant again this gave me a reason to

00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,420
go back to Firefox and keep Firefox as

00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,060
one of the main tools in my development

00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:27,280
arsenal that chrome would kind of you

00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,870
know taken over so make sure that you

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,040
grab the latest version of Firefox and

00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:33,190
get really used to the grid tooling

00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:36,160
because it will help you a lot we'll see

00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:39,490
a little bit more of this later on all

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:45,180
right so let's put some stuff back in

00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:45,180
this grid under our way back there

00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:52,390
so this is cool

00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:53,650
tells us a lot about what we've got but

00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,810
I don't know I don't know about you but

00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:58,000
not many of my applications consist of

00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:00,340
nineteen evenly spaced blocks that all

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,520
look the same I want to be able to do

00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:06,880
more than this so before we move on

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:10,360
give me a download check how we doing is

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:13,380
it working if only I thought to bring a

00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,040
prize sorry

00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,750
anybody that's still working on it

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,830
hopefully it's still progressing because

00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,880
we're gonna get to workshop in just a

00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:21,820
second I want you to be able to do it

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,470
locally all right so like I said not

00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,120
many of my applications consist of just

00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,610
this sort of thing I want to be able to

00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,650
start using this for real and it's

00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:31,900
fantastic for applications but it's just

00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:33,340
as good for documents or things that

00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,990
would typically be considered documents

00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,510
so things where he got headers and

00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,550
content and asides and images and stuff

00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:43,270
like that so now I'm gonna go back

00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:45,880
briefly oh I'll show you the example

00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:49,180
first then we'll talk about code to that

00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:52,420
some assembly required example so here

00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:55,150
if you look we've got a header we've got

00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:57,820
some text we've got the best person in

00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:59,380
the world and we've got a footer at the

00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,540
bottom we don't make mistakes just have

00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,100
little accidents now this is actually

00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,020
fine the way that it is there's really

00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,900
nothing horribly wrong with this layout

00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:09,130
it's not exactly what we want but

00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,390
everything's just kind of straight line

00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,790
this is this probably be a fairly

00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:15,490
effective mobile layout but we can do

00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,570
more on a desktop so what I want to do

00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:18,130
is I want to use some of these new

00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,600
things that we've learned some of the

00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,830
grid stuff that we've learned as well as

00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,660
it introduced a couple of ideas that we

00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,980
haven't seen yet to start playing with

00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:27,430
this layout that's why your reason I

00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:29,100
call it a happy little sandbox so let's

00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:32,140
see what sort of trouble we can get into

00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:36,840
rearranging Bob Ross's a little article

00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:39,190
here so this example is example sandbox

00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,130
make this slightly smaller so I can see

00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:43,690
more on my screen and just to show you

00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:47,230
what we're working with here's the HTML

00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:48,760
for it not really anything shocking now

00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,750
immediately people are going to start

00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,920
going away tonight why aren't you using

00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,300
like the header element why aren't you

00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,160
using the main element we'll get there

00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,590
for right now I just wanted to show you

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,549
plain old divs with classes applied to

00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,289
them because you're going to see a

00:39:57,549 --> 00:40:00,659
of grid code that's gonna work against

00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:02,769
HTML that looks like this

00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:04,599
also you might not always have control

00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:07,899
over the HTML that you're having to deal

00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:10,179
with with grid so knowing how to deal

00:40:07,899 --> 00:40:14,079
with HTML that may not be optimally

00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:16,029
designed often really useful so you can

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,380
see at the very beginning I already have

00:40:16,029 --> 00:40:18,999
one thing that I told you I wouldn't

00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,559
normally have there's this big wrapper

00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:22,449
div around the whole thing so there's a

00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:24,699
div that goes from the top all the way

00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:26,529
down to the bottom and I've given it a

00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:29,079
class of sandbox so that we able to grab

00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:31,539
ahold of it later my heading no big

00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:32,709
shock class of heading I have a div in

00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:35,919
the middle with a bunch of paragraphs

00:40:32,709 --> 00:40:38,890
inside it's got all the content and then

00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:40,899
finally here's our picture of Bob and an

00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:42,429
h2 that we gave a class of footer at the

00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:44,769
bottom because I'm pretending I don't

00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:46,359
know about the footer element yet with

00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:47,829
our footer text inside of it and that's

00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:50,409
the whole thing not terribly complicated

00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:53,619
HTML we can get a lot more complicated

00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:54,849
than this and we will but we got a lot

00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:56,199
of pieces that we can play with them we

00:40:54,849 --> 00:40:58,569
got a lot of stuff that we can move

00:40:56,199 --> 00:41:03,219
around with grid but what we don't have

00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:04,419
is much happening over in the CSS so

00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:06,639
I've given you a little bit of CSS to

00:41:04,419 --> 00:41:08,259
start with so that you can actually see

00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,599
we've got a background color that's

00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:13,239
behind each one of these things inside

00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:14,829
of the sandbox every element inside the

00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:16,269
sandbox has been given a background

00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:17,769
color of white and the reason that it

00:41:16,269 --> 00:41:19,899
did that it so it's very obvious where

00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:21,669
each thing is on the page as we start

00:41:19,899 --> 00:41:22,959
moving it around I put a little bit of

00:41:21,669 --> 00:41:24,939
padding in place so that we weren't

00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:28,689
right up against the wall on our

00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:30,369
viewport but there's no grid there's

00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:31,749
there's no nothing in here that says lay

00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:35,049
things out a certain way it's basically

00:41:31,749 --> 00:41:36,429
all just source order I've given you a

00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:37,479
few empty spots down at the bottom

00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:39,399
because we know we're gonna want to put

00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:40,929
some rules in there in just a second but

00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:42,729
they're not there yet the only rule

00:41:40,929 --> 00:41:46,839
we've really got is the thing says make

00:41:42,729 --> 00:41:48,639
Bob really wide and Bob is really really

00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,099
wide right now it's probably the biggest

00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:53,639
bob ross you've ever seen in your life

00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:57,369
everybody just feels warmer already okay

00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:59,349
so let's do some stuff our sandbox

00:41:57,369 --> 00:42:00,939
element that's that big wrapper div we

00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:02,529
want to put something in there that says

00:42:00,939 --> 00:42:06,669
okay I'm gonna start moving stuff around

00:42:02,529 --> 00:42:08,109
and that is display : grid now that's

00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:10,509
the only thing I'm gonna change save

00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,079
that go back here and take a look and

00:42:10,509 --> 00:42:14,229
see what

00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:17,469
it's literally nothing there's just

00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:19,359
nothing to see here and that's fine if

00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:21,219
you give display grid without any

00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,959
additional rules you're basically going

00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:24,999
to get things laid out in the order that

00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:27,099
they came inside of the the Dom there

00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:30,069
are a few small tweaks and if we came in

00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:31,630
here and did something like grid gap and

00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:36,160
I'll say something really crazy like you

00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:38,049
know 50 pixels then as soon as I refresh

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,789
you can actually see these are grid

00:42:38,049 --> 00:42:41,469
items and that's the technical term each

00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:43,989
one of those things that shows up in a

00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:45,789
grid cell or a set of grid cells that's

00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:48,819
an item in the grid or a grid item and

00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:51,130
what we're saying with grid gap is how

00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:53,709
much space that we want between each one

00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:55,809
of those cells so rows and columns can

00:42:53,709 --> 00:42:57,519
have gaps between them this may not seem

00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:59,049
like a big deal but this is surprisingly

00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,390
hard to do or hard to do consistently

00:42:59,049 --> 00:43:03,489
and grid makes it trivially easy we just

00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:05,349
say we'd like these cells range in this

00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:06,969
way and put this much space between them

00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,440
so if you've ever struggled a little bit

00:43:06,969 --> 00:43:09,999
with flexbox in the whole space around

00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,489
space between and trying to figure out

00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:14,200
what to do this is this is grid kind of

00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,759
leaning that way and it kind of gets to

00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:19,299
a theme of one of the differences

00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:22,150
between grid and flex which is flex is

00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:23,140
mostly about flexibility the squishiness

00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:25,719
of your layout

00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:27,789
Rachele andrea likes to call it grid

00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:30,999
while it can be made very very flexible

00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:32,739
and we'll see examples of that leans a

00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:34,719
little more toward the rigidity where

00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:36,640
you can say I want this specific layout

00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:38,140
sure these things can move around in a

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,390
certain way and they can adjust around

00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:44,249
one another but primarily we want this

00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:46,059
layout more rigidity less squishiness

00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:47,079
that doesn't mean they can't be used

00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:48,369
together it doesn't mean they can't be

00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:49,959
used for a lot of the same thing there's

00:43:48,369 --> 00:43:51,239
huge overlap between what you can do

00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:53,229
with grid and what you can do with flex

00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:54,519
and we'll talk a little bit about where

00:43:53,229 --> 00:43:56,769
it makes sense to use one or the other

00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:58,539
but in large part a lot of what you

00:43:56,769 --> 00:44:00,130
might have reached for flex to do you

00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:02,109
can totally do with grid and personally

00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,880
I often find it easier at least I find

00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:06,940
the API surface a bit more

00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,140
straightforward to me this was a little

00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,849
easier to understand and some of the

00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,709
spacing mechanisms and flex for example

00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:13,900
all right so we've got display grid

00:44:11,709 --> 00:44:16,569
we've given a grid gap but we want to

00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:18,699
start putting things side-by-side so you

00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:20,979
saw an example of that earlier remember

00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:22,989
we were on example blocks and sure

00:44:20,979 --> 00:44:24,230
enough we had this grid template columns

00:44:22,989 --> 00:44:26,090
or the repeat so we're gonna read

00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:28,580
for that first I'm gonna come back over

00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:32,810
here and say grid it's like it's spell

00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:34,220
grid template columns and I'm not gonna

00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:35,869
use the repeat trick yet I'm just gonna

00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:40,990
put a couple of values in there so I'm

00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:40,990
gonna say like 200 pixels and 300 pixels

00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:45,770
notice I haven't placed anything

00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:47,390
anywhere I haven't said put the header

00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:48,859
in a certain place put the body in a

00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:51,410
certain place put the image anywhere all

00:44:48,859 --> 00:44:53,240
I did was I said my grid has two columns

00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:55,730
one of them is 200 pixels one of them is

00:44:53,240 --> 00:45:00,710
300 pixels and that is really too narrow

00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:02,810
so we're gonna say 500 and like 800 and

00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:04,670
now you can actually see the grid

00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:06,350
beginning to take shape even though we

00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:08,570
didn't explicitly place anything

00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:10,550
the automatic layout algorithm the grid

00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:12,800
has living behind it starts to put

00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:14,900
things in the individual spots this is a

00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,820
really surprise we saw exactly the same

00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,260
same thing happening with our blocks but

00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:21,920
now they're not just blocks they're

00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:23,600
actual h2s and divs with a class on them

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,130
and they're beginning to land in the

00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,470
different places that we defined in our

00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:30,830
grid notice also what's happened to Bob

00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:32,270
Bob's gotten a lot more manageable he

00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:34,520
doesn't take over the entire width of

00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:37,940
the page anymore we gave that 100% width

00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,140
and 100% can mean a lot of different

00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,540
things at a lot of different times in

00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,280
this grid item it means take up the

00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,990
width of that grid item I am glossing

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,960
over an amazing number of details by

00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:48,950
saying that but for now it takes up a

00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,359
hundred percent of the width of that

00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:52,310
grid item later on we start to get a

00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:54,230
little fancy with images you'll see more

00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:59,060
tricks that we can do but already this

00:45:54,230 --> 00:46:00,320
is pretty useful but this isn't

00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,700
everything we want to do I'm gonna back

00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:05,510
off a little bit on this so I can have

00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:08,060
more space to play with we really want

00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:11,060
to start placing things in specific

00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:13,220
spots for example this header it's not

00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,619
really a header anymore it'd sure be

00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,940
nice if it took up the entire width of

00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:18,470
the content that we're working with here

00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:21,050
so that's the first thing that I want to

00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:23,180
try to solve so that is a div with class

00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:26,869
heading just to remind you what that

00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:29,720
looks like we've got our div class of

00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:31,220
heading that's the thing I want to make

00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,930
stretch all the way across the page I

00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:35,150
got lots of ways to do that I'm going to

00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:36,590
show you one of those ways and I'll warn

00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,160
you it's going to get a little bit

00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:38,569
unwieldy

00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,460
we begin to take this technique further

00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:42,319
that's totally cool we want to

00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:45,230
understand how it works so that we can

00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:47,890
do it better a little bit later on so in

00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:53,530
here I want my heading to take up a

00:46:47,890 --> 00:47:01,369
specific place so I'm gonna say grid

00:46:53,530 --> 00:47:03,500
column start and column one okay so see

00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:05,000
if that changes anything nope

00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,390
why didn't change anything because it

00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,500
was already starting in column one then

00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,520
people are like wait a minute we're all

00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,710
programmers isn't it supposed to be

00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:16,010
column zero no sorry

00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:17,329
column one CSS was not made for you it

00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:18,859
was made for those people that we have

00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:23,569
to like take their Photoshop mock-ups

00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:25,099
and make them make sense one we already

00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:26,180
started a column one so there's not

00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:29,089
really anything different there but what

00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:34,670
we can do is say we want to take up more

00:47:29,089 --> 00:47:37,789
columns so instead of saying grid column

00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:39,500
start here let's try remember tables

00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:43,010
what are we doing tables we wanted a

00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:46,099
cell to take up like more stuff we need

00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:46,940
spans so I'm gonna try spanning a couple

00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:51,380
these columns

00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:52,880
oh my god look at that remember what I

00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,990
said sometimes like working with grid is

00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,960
almost like working with tables without

00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:58,430
tables this is kind of what I mean it

00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,079
was already started in column one so we

00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:02,359
don't have to specify that but we could

00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:05,200
say we want to take up this many of

00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:07,430
those columns span two of those columns

00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,650
and sure enough that's exactly what

00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:12,170
we've done we didn't explicitly have to

00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:15,920
place this anywhere we simply said take

00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:18,200
up this much room cool that does now

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,359
mean that our content block the div of

00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:24,500
class equal content is starting down

00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:28,220
here on the second row so we start in

00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:30,890
column one row one for a header span two

00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:34,490
columns and end up with our content

00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:35,779
starting in column one of row two now

00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:37,779
that seems a little bit weird because I

00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:41,329
didn't say anything about rows up here

00:48:37,779 --> 00:48:43,910
well that's fine grid totally is okay

00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:45,799
with that we'll get deeper into it later

00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,839
but there's the idea of what's known as

00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:50,990
an explicit grid the grid that you've

00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:53,270
defined and the implicit grid

00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:55,400
grid that gets created for you as you

00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:57,680
begin using it and if you have more

00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,619
things than you've actually defined

00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,330
places for grid school with that it's

00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:05,180
like great I'll just start giving you

00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:08,300
more an explicit grid and an implicit

00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:12,050
grid if we flip back over to Firefox

00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:15,920
briefly and go to where we actually want

00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:18,710
to be we can take a look at our notice

00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,420
div sandbox it realizes it has a grid on

00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:22,910
it so it's like you can turn the grid

00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:25,550
overlay on if you want and sure enough

00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:27,830
there's our grid overlay and if you look

00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:30,860
very closely you can actually see that

00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:33,230
grid forming up so the outer most

00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,760
boundaries that solid red line

00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:36,590
I made it red so it was easy to see

00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:39,460
that's the boundaries of the explicit

00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:42,500
grid but as we get further out our

00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:43,580
boundary lines begin to get dashed and

00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,810
dotted and they have different

00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,760
appearances depending on where you are

00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:48,710
in the grid and that's the implicit grid

00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,300
beginning to show up now the wonderful

00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:52,310
thing is we've actually got rules that

00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:54,800
we could set here about how CSS grid

00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:56,600
creates that implicit grid for us but we

00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,300
don't have to specify all of the rules

00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,590
for every possible item in the grid we

00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,970
haven't done that here we've simply said

00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:03,740
we're gonna have two columns and that

00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:06,500
everything begins landing in those two

00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:08,420
columns unless we've told it to take up

00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:11,109
more than two columns like we did here

00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:15,020
so far so good

00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:18,830
so what I want to do next well I kind of

00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:20,540
want my content to take up more room but

00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:23,480
I don't want to lose Bob I'm kind of

00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:25,190
liking Bob being up higher so let's try

00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,630
to put Bob where we really wanted to be

00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,030
like maybe over here on the left-hand

00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:30,619
side

00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:34,520
all right so Bob well what do you think

00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:36,560
Bob's class is sure enough class Bob we

00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:40,700
said he takes up a hundred percent let's

00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:43,520
put him grid column start well what what

00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:46,940
columns should Bob start in not zero one

00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:50,630
all right making one tiny change at a

00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:51,740
time let's see what happens okay well

00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:54,619
Bob's in column one but there's a

00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:57,109
problem we kind of wanted him to the

00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:59,600
left of our content but that didn't

00:50:57,109 --> 00:51:01,910
happen why is that that's because that

00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:03,859
automatic flow algorithm is doing what

00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:04,380
it's supposed to do it's like well you

00:51:03,859 --> 00:51:06,210
told

00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:08,190
where certain things were positioned so

00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:10,230
I'm gonna flow stuff around those things

00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:13,140
I'm gonna make things make sense unless

00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:14,789
you tell me more rules in order to

00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:17,759
position things fortunately you can

00:51:14,789 --> 00:51:19,650
absolutely say you have more rules so we

00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:23,720
don't want Bob to just start at column

00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:26,519
one we also want Bob to start at Row one

00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:28,759
all right one tiny change let's see what

00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:31,349
happens

00:51:28,759 --> 00:51:35,690
oops Row 1 is not actually what we

00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:35,690
wanted we actually wanted Row 2

00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:42,029
this is what we wanted we wanted to Bob

00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:43,289
off to the left-hand side one of the

00:51:42,029 --> 00:51:45,029
content on the right hand side well

00:51:43,289 --> 00:51:46,799
header to go all the way across let's

00:51:45,029 --> 00:51:48,420
see what terrible and awful things have

00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:50,009
happened to our footer well they're not

00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,670
actually that bad how would we fix the

00:51:50,009 --> 00:51:57,000
footer here span - all right so what is

00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:59,069
our footer our footer is because we

00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,069
don't understand HTML sectioning

00:51:59,069 --> 00:52:04,799
elements yet H - of a class of footer so

00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:12,500
I'm gonna grab this footer I'm gonna say

00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:12,500
that the grid column for that is span -

00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,109
there we go

00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,269
gonna back way off so you can see the

00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:23,339
whole thing we have our header spanning

00:52:21,269 --> 00:52:24,839
all the way across the top we got Bob on

00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:26,339
the Left we've got our content on the

00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:27,779
right they're taking up the amount of

00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:29,700
space that we wanted - so Bob is a

00:52:27,779 --> 00:52:31,019
little narrower than the content and we

00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,970
got the footer that goes all the way

00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:34,799
across the bottom now we took a bunch of

00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:36,329
tiny steps to get there but if you step

00:52:34,799 --> 00:52:39,509
back and look at what we had to do

00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:41,940
what's actually that terrible we said

00:52:39,509 --> 00:52:43,049
that we wanted a display of grid give a

00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,849
little bit of gap I'm actually gonna

00:52:43,049 --> 00:52:46,529
bump that gap down so we don't have to

00:52:44,849 --> 00:52:48,119
worry about it as much we defined what

00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:49,950
our columns would look like and then

00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:52,440
after that it was basically a few tweaks

00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:54,059
where we took advantage of the way that

00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,029
grid automatically lays things out for

00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:59,039
us it was really just like spam - with

00:52:57,029 --> 00:53:04,829
the header span - with the footer put

00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:08,309
Bob in the right place get the idea all

00:53:04,829 --> 00:53:11,730
right I'm almost scared to ask how we're

00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:13,080
doing with our local installs I see lots

00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:20,370
of thumbs up

00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:24,420
okay so hidden away in our examples here

00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:27,690
or excuse me in our in our application

00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:29,520
we've got workshops so I want to start

00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:31,800
you off really simple and since I am a

00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:35,520
programmer and not a designer I started

00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:39,140
my workshops at zero so if you look at

00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:41,520
workshop zero we got four divs laid out

00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:43,260
they're not doing anything special about

00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,120
the only styling on this page is the

00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,650
borders and the background color for the

00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,900
divs and a little bit of padding so they

00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:50,220
were sitting around up against the edge

00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:52,950
if you look in the source code you'll

00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:55,050
see that there is a workshop zero and

00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:58,020
workshop zero has all the pieces that

00:53:55,050 --> 00:54:00,330
you need inside of it here's our HTML

00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,620
should look shockingly familiar it's

00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:04,620
basically iterating over a bunch of

00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:08,640
labels get a div for each one of them

00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:09,990
our our typescript is creating those

00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,640
labels for us but instead of creating

00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:17,480
twenty of them or five of them it's

00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:20,670
creating four I less than five the CSS

00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,350
it's really just styling the host

00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:25,740
element enough so that you've got some

00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:28,440
padding and making the divs visible on

00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:30,150
the screen so what I want you to do is

00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,620
using these tiny little building blocks

00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:33,510
are we get to play with some of the

00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:35,220
ideas that we've just talked about I

00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:39,020
want you to set this thing up with

00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:41,730
display grid and then I want you to

00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:44,400
position some of those things in places

00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:45,870
on that grid go crazy wherever you want

00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,220
them to be I want you to make them

00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:48,600
different sizes I want you to make them

00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,950
span multiple columns

00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,710
I also want you to make them span

00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:54,150
multiple rows once you've got some

00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:57,000
interesting things going on in your

00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:58,980
little toy grid go into Firefox and take

00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,370
a look at what you can actually see with

00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,690
the grid inspector experiment with the

00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:06,990
tools that your end up you're gonna end

00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:08,940
up using a whole lot now we have a

00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:10,470
workshop that's coming not too far after

00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,000
this it's going to build on these ideas

00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:14,250
plus the ones we were just looking out

00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,050
with Bob to build what's known as the

00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:18,030
holy grail layout but don't try to go

00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:19,650
there yet all I really wanted to do at

00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:21,390
this point is play with some of the

00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:24,320
ideas that we've expose you to display

00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:26,430
grid the host selector things like that

00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:28,260
so we'll take

00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:30,840
five ten minutes experiment with that

00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:33,150
stuff and then we'll move on to some

00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,410
more interesting things that will build

00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:36,630
on the ideas that we've already done and

00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:39,620
also show you how you can make this a

00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:46,050
lot less tedious everybody good

00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:51,960
go forth and conquer all right so let's

00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:53,520
play with this idea a little bit first

00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:58,410
thing I'm gonna need to do is make this

00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:59,610
thing display grid well I already had to

00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:01,350
display their exchange it to display

00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:03,540
grid save see if that made any

00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:05,070
difference at all nope

00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,990
just as expected didn't really make any

00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:09,300
difference but we want to start putting

00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:12,120
things in different places on this page

00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:14,070
so I can arbitrarily decide what I want

00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:16,560
to do here it was really up to you how

00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:18,330
you wanted to place things one key to

00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,250
that is having some way to grab a hold

00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:22,620
of an individual div and if you recall

00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:26,670
we have these labels that we're building

00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:30,210
and I'm specifically saying that each

00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:33,090
one of these divs has a title property

00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:34,290
based on the label that gives me a

00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:37,470
really easy way to grab ahold of an

00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:42,000
individual div because this label

00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:45,060
property ends up as an attribute or the

00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,910
value of an attribute on that div so in

00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:49,140
the CSS I can reach in and say you know

00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:52,260
all the divs are going to look like that

00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:55,230
but a specific div with the title of say

00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:57,120
3a I'll put it in quotes that way it'll

00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:58,290
actually work I can make a little bit

00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,570
different so I'll move that to the top

00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:04,950
so you can see it specifically I want

00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:08,720
the border to be four pixels solid red

00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:08,720
on this guy let's see what happens

00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:17,520
nothing all right so we go in here take

00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:21,930
a look title label will make it really

00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:24,000
easy on ourselves we'll say that we'll

00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:30,910
just no no I don't want to cheat I don't

00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:37,060
want to cheat div three and

00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:37,060
background color though it sort of Lee

00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:51,880
nope still nothing geez excuse me oh of

00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:55,960
course there we go

00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:57,310
I'm so glad you're here there we go

00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,620
isn't that attractive Christmas colors

00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:01,960
all of a sudden yeah let's fix that all

00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:03,460
right light green all right so now that

00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,930
I can actually see that div I want to

00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:09,190
put him specifically somewhere on the

00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:13,780
page well that's pretty easy we can say

00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:20,670
that we want our grid row to be like 2

00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:20,670
and our grid column to be 3

00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:26,080
now there's gonna be a problem

00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:28,840
we haven't actually defined any of this

00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:31,510
stuff yet so grid is making this up for

00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:33,580
us this is a little bit weird it's kind

00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:35,320
of like with arrays in JavaScript if you

00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:36,850
say you know my array is 10 items long

00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:39,370
and I want to put something in slot 100

00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:41,050
it just does it so we've got a similar

00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:42,550
thing going on here we actually want to

00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,350
give this grid a little bit of

00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:47,830
definition well we got to do that grid

00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:51,580
template columns and we can say that we

00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:57,250
want to repeat like three times at 200

00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:59,380
pixels so now we actually have a little

00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:07,600
bit of definition and we can say that we

00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:09,190
want a grid gap of 20 pixels again so

00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:12,460
now we've got our grid beginning to form

00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:15,280
up if we wanted the three div to take up

00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:19,950
a little more room pretty easy let's go

00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,950
to the three and say that it needs to

00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,510
span two

00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:31,170
see what's happening this is a little

00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:32,550
bit strange because it's like wait a

00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:34,020
minute didn't we tell it to start no sir

00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:35,640
yes we did we told it exactly where to

00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:38,010
start and then we told it to span a

00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,470
certain amount of space a certain number

00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:41,850
of cells and so CSS grid has extended

00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:44,070
the grid for us in that particular

00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:45,960
direction now sometimes what we want to

00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:47,970
do is we want to say I want you to start

00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,320
at the beginning and go to the end but I

00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:51,540
don't specifically want to tell you

00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:54,060
where the end is so let's imagine that

00:59:51,540 --> 01:00:04,290
with div number three we wanted to do

00:59:54,060 --> 01:00:06,510
that that's a pretty cool trick notice I

01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:08,130
didn't need to know or care how big the

01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:10,740
grid was in order for this to work so

01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:13,050
can't see what I'm doing I've said what

01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:15,840
row to start with but for the particular

01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:18,540
column I said starting column one and go

01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:21,359
to the last column negative one is

01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:23,609
counting back from the other side and if

01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:25,140
we're in Firefox and we turn on our grid

01:00:23,609 --> 01:00:27,030
inspector for our workshop if you look

01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:30,330
very closely look at that that's line

01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:32,609
number negative one and row number

01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:34,590
negative one so if we want to position

01:00:32,609 --> 01:00:36,359
things like in a corner and the far

01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:38,580
right-hand bottom we can totally do that

01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:40,020
by saying negative one negative one or

01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:41,640
if we wanted to come back to negative

01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:43,740
two we could do that so we could say

01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:49,350
that this guy should go from the

01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:52,740
beginning to this line see how this

01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:54,270
works now this is all wonderful this

01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,560
gives us a lot of the primitives that we

01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:56,940
need in order to start really moving

01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:59,550
things around and positioning stuff on

01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:02,040
the page but unfortunately it is fairly

01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:03,240
primitive you need these things but it

01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,869
would sure be nice to work at a higher

01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:11,190
level so let's start moving up the stack

01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:14,250
a little bit so you remember back here

01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:16,350
with Bob we use that span trick and

01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:17,940
column start row start stuff like that

01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:20,820
to position things specifically on the

01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:22,770
page well we want to get smarter about

01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:25,140
that what would be really nice is if we

01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:26,490
didn't have to do so much math because

01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,540
it's really easy to get wrong do you

01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:30,570
remember when I was first trying to

01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:32,730
position Bob I put him in the first row

01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:34,560
instead of the second row and I'm like

01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:36,450
oh crap had to let me move that down

01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,340
easy mistake to make and you make it all

01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:39,270
the time what would be really nice is if

01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:40,000
you had somewhere to lay things out

01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:41,770
where you didn't have to

01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,950
and on that stuff so hard and there

01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:49,000
absolutely is a way to do it so in here

01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:52,180
we're gonna go ahead and move to another

01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,890
workshop say I load you all until a

01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:55,750
false sense of security and now remember

01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:58,270
writing a fair amount of code so this

01:01:55,750 --> 01:02:00,130
looks a lot like our Bob example except

01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:03,700
instead of Bob it's another really cool

01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:06,370
dude Carl Sagan I did remember the space

01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:08,470
theme it's Carl Sagan some quotes from

01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:13,420
the book pale blue dot by Carl Sagan and

01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:14,800
a picture of us most of you weren't born

01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:17,890
when this picture was taken but we are

01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:20,200
all here and that's Earth this is the

01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:21,310
pale blue dot in the essay and what we

01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,080
want to do is we want to lay this thing

01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:26,140
out kind of the way that we did with Bob

01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:28,240
but we don't want to use the same tricks

01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:29,380
that we did before so I'm going to save

01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,090
you a little bit of energy and a little

01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:32,500
bit of thought and show you what I would

01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:33,580
do to lay this out and then you can do

01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,810
the equivalent you can either follow

01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:36,280
along or you can do it after I've shown

01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:41,680
you show you how it works

01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:44,800
so this is workshop 1 in workshop 1 I've

01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:46,060
got all those pieces as HTML but I've

01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,770
started taking advantage of some of

01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:49,690
those HTML sectioning elements that we

01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:51,910
mentioned I've still got my wrapper div

01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:53,260
I'll keep him around for the moment but

01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:56,500
he'll e-even he'll go away eventually

01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:58,030
but now I've got a header element I've

01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:00,610
got this main element that has all of

01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:03,160
our paragraphs inside of it I've got a

01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:06,130
couple of images with classes on them so

01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:07,840
they're easy to grab ahold of I've got

01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:09,550
an aside another one of those HTML

01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:11,440
section elements and finally a footer

01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:13,030
now you might think wow everything's

01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,400
different now how do I'd use grid for

01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:18,160
all this exactly the same way you're

01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,870
just applying grid rules to selectors

01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,910
and in this case the selector is going

01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:23,170
to be element names or class names so we

01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:25,990
can grab ahold of the header just the

01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:29,290
way we did with dot content or dot

01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:30,940
footer or dot heading it's just an

01:03:29,290 --> 01:03:32,890
element name instead and since we're in

01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,900
an angular application and angular does

01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:38,080
view encapsulation for us it means that

01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:39,370
we don't run afoul of other problems by

01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,660
having rules like this that would

01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:42,910
normally cause the wheels to just fly

01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:44,710
off your application everywhere we've

01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:46,960
encapsulated this rule to just the one

01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:48,820
place that we want it to exist but what

01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,980
I want to do here is I want to lay out

01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:53,080
an article much like an art of the page

01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:53,560
much like I did with Bob but I don't

01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,330
want to use

01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,880
all those spam tricks like I did earlier

01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:59,350
they work but they're tedious so the

01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:02,950
first place I'm gonna start is with

01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:04,990
display grid so that's great

01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:07,540
puts us in just grid context we can work

01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:08,770
with and now I want to set up my grid

01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:10,450
but I don't want to set my grid up the

01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:11,950
way that I did earlier I want to take

01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:16,480
advantage of this wonderful thing called

01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:19,120
grid template areas and in here I can

01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:21,310
basically draw a little chart I can say

01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:23,500
that I want my header to go all the way

01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:25,180
across the page if I wanted to I could

01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:30,160
give it the specific size of that header

01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:32,950
row I want to make my main element do

01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:35,410
the same thing I want my footer to go

01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:37,630
across the bottom I need to put those

01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:40,240
pictures somewhere so I'll put Carl in

01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:41,590
one of those spots and I'll put the pale

01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,630
blue dot and another one now I've

01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:45,550
actually built this layout so that it

01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:47,110
looks exactly the same as what we've

01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:49,030
currently got and I'm not quite finished

01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:50,470
they still have more to do I need to say

01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:52,180
what each one of those grid areas

01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:54,280
actually corresponds to that's pretty

01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:56,980
easy you probably guess what each one is

01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:59,290
gonna mean so along with those grid

01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:02,890
template areas I'm gonna say that I have

01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:05,350
a header and I'm just targeting the

01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:07,720
header element and I'm saying that the

01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:09,640
grid area for the header is called

01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:11,760
header those names do not have to match

01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:15,000
they happen to in this particular case

01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:17,290
so see if we've made any progress here

01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,300
everything looks the same well kind of

01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:21,520
should because our source order layout

01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:23,890
and our grid layout so far is exactly

01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,850
the same I'll put a grid gap in here so

01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:27,910
you can actually see some of this stuff

01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:30,780
start showing up grid gap and we'll make

01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:32,710
it nice and large so it's easy to see

01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:34,960
see if that makes any difference

01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:37,030
sure enough now you can see our header

01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,290
actually lives on the page but just to

01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:44,970
prove to you that something's going on

01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:47,470
let's try flipping header and main aha

01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:49,210
something has actually changed now we

01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:50,890
haven't specified a grid area for

01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:52,870
anything except our header but this is

01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:55,150
already doing some work for us our main

01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:56,980
is in the slot right above where our

01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:59,230
header is our header is now somehow down

01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:00,400
on the page so this gives us a clue is

01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,720
how we do the rest of this stuff I'm

01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,930
gonna put header back where it belongs

01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:06,480
and I'm gonna start adding areas for all

01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:08,550
the other elements so

01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:12,690
Maine should be in grid area called

01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:16,490
Maine and footer should be in the grid

01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:18,540
area called and you guess footer a

01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:20,460
little more complicated to deal with the

01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:21,900
images but not a lot they have classes

01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:23,580
so we can't target them by element name

01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:27,600
but one of them is called Carl and his

01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:29,250
grid area is Carl notice it's not the

01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,930
same as the dot class name

01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:32,580
it's just Carl because that's all we

01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:33,390
called it right up here we could have

01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:35,100
called it Bob

01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:37,619
we've been confusing but it would work

01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:39,090
and then finally pbd that's where our

01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:41,369
pale blue dot image is supposed to go

01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:44,300
and we'll put that in exactly what you

01:06:41,369 --> 01:06:47,100
would expect grid area peb edy

01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:48,480
now again nothing really changed at this

01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,490
point because we've kept the source

01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:54,840
order and the grid order basically the

01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:56,220
same if you notice our footer is still

01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,810
showing up exactly where the source

01:06:56,220 --> 01:07:00,180
order said that it should so that's the

01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:00,480
first thing that we could fix we kind of

01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:04,890
want

01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:06,210
oh it sees me it's on our side we kind

01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:09,600
of want to move some things around a

01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:10,080
little bit so let's move Carl up to the

01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,880
top

01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:14,490
how would we do that well it's as easy

01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:17,910
as going in here and saying I'd really

01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:24,720
prefer Carl to be up here so it'll be

01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:26,280
right under the header now before I make

01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,170
this any more complicated you kind of

01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:29,340
get in the picture literally are you

01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:32,450
kind of getting the picture you're

01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:34,619
drawing a diagram of your layout and

01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:37,230
everything can be put in each one of

01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:39,720
those individual slots now this is great

01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:44,369
but if you remember we had Bob earlier

01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:45,359
and Bob well he was off to the side so

01:07:44,369 --> 01:07:47,609
we kind of like to be able to do stuff

01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:50,250
like that too so we need to be able to

01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:51,750
define multiple columns and it's a

01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:54,420
little bit unusual but it's not hard to

01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:57,480
do we can say that we're actually gonna

01:07:54,420 --> 01:08:00,270
have a couple of columns and things are

01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:02,670
gonna fall into those different slots so

01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:05,430
we'll just make the header and the

01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:08,040
footer go across two different columns

01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:11,060
and we'll make Carl stay off to the

01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,060
left-hand side of Main

01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:20,600
yep would help if I don't get Carl look

01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:22,790
at that our header goes all the way

01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:29,600
across the top was it was that almost

01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:31,569
some applause I didn't make it I'm just

01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,369
using it but yay

01:08:31,569 --> 01:08:38,650
so that pictures off the left main on

01:08:34,369 --> 01:08:40,310
the right are a side or our footer

01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:41,989
everything's laying out where we

01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:46,639
expected it to this is pretty cool

01:08:41,989 --> 01:08:47,480
except I made a typo there we go now

01:08:46,639 --> 01:08:48,679
once we do it

01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:53,170
everything should be where it's supposed

01:08:48,679 --> 01:08:53,170
to be I'll zoom way out so you can see

01:08:53,469 --> 01:08:57,589
even the zoom level doesn't actually

01:08:55,730 --> 01:09:00,380
affect the the placement we're still

01:08:57,589 --> 01:09:02,089
good so by default these things are

01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,980
simply taking up the entire width the

01:09:02,089 --> 01:09:05,420
viewport that we're working with and we

01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:07,159
can make this as complicated as we want

01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:09,319
if we needed 10 columns we could say the

01:09:07,159 --> 01:09:11,719
header stretches from column 7 to column

01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:12,830
9 and main goes from all the way at the

01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:14,179
left all the way through right and the

01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:17,509
pictures or wherever you want them to be

01:09:14,179 --> 01:09:18,679
and it all just works if I wanted to I

01:09:17,509 --> 01:09:19,699
could come in here and say that the

01:09:18,679 --> 01:09:21,529
header should be a certain height

01:09:19,699 --> 01:09:22,489
remember grids all about two dimensions

01:09:21,529 --> 01:09:24,199
and you really have complete control

01:09:22,489 --> 01:09:29,540
over that so if I wanted to I could say

01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:30,940
that this needs to be 300 pixels tall so

01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:34,369
now our header is gonna be a little more

01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:35,659
aggressive up I killed my layout I

01:09:34,369 --> 01:09:39,710
apologize

01:09:35,659 --> 01:09:41,600
so in here we'll do auto here auto here

01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:43,880
and we'll actually give these things

01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,830
some widths as well just to do the whole

01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,989
thing out so off the left hand side I

01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:52,630
want this to be 200 pixels wide and this

01:09:47,989 --> 01:09:55,040
to be like 500 pixels wide oh excuse me

01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:58,040
also need to generalize a bit there we

01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:00,530
go so now you see what I've done I've

01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:02,210
made the header header I've made the

01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:04,820
picture quite a bit narrower by

01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:06,710
specifying some some measurements around

01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:09,969
the edges of the grid but everything's

01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:12,290
still working the way it's supposed to

01:10:09,969 --> 01:10:13,429
so I went from grid template areas so

01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:14,989
the thing called grid template there's

01:10:13,429 --> 01:10:16,550
even a shorter hand syntax called just

01:10:14,989 --> 01:10:18,199
grid where you can specify even more

01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:19,790
things but what I basically said here is

01:10:18,199 --> 01:10:21,739
here are the slots where things are

01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:24,050
going to fall into here's how tall

01:10:21,739 --> 01:10:25,070
that's supposed to be these others

01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:26,290
they're going to take out whatever room

01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:28,210
they take up in fact

01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:29,790
I usually just leave this Auto out there

01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:32,020
other places where I want to specify it

01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:35,530
but it takes up as much room as it needs

01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:37,240
to and then after a slash I'm saying how

01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:40,900
why each one of these things needs to be

01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:43,150
as a column and everything falls into

01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:45,040
place and again if I want to move stuff

01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:46,900
around if for whatever reason I decided

01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:49,660
that I really need my footer to be at

01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:53,140
the very top of my page then I could do

01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:55,960
that now I will warn you it's easy to

01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:58,420
get drunk with power with this source

01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,890
order is still important super important

01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,960
for things like accessibility screen

01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:04,360
readers they're not paying attention to

01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:06,640
what your grid layout looks like so try

01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:08,620
to resist the urge to go in and like

01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,210
just vomit out your elements wherever

01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:12,190
they happen to land on the page and then

01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:14,170
you CSS to put them wherever they belong

01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:15,970
because some things will still care

01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:18,760
about that actual source or source order

01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:21,690
so usually what I do is not what you see

01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:24,220
me doing right here I keep the the order

01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:26,080
matching the source order but if I

01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:29,620
wanted to it means that it's very easy

01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:32,160
for me to do things like you know I'll

01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:36,280
move pbd here and I'll make Carl

01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:37,690
slightly take up slightly more space so

01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:39,100
now I'm not really changing the order of

01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:40,900
things much that people might get to

01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:43,330
with their screen readers but it also

01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:47,080
works so see now my footer is landing in

01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:48,880
a different place anyway I want you to

01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:51,010
take advantage of this grid template and

01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,990
grid template areas idea and layout

01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:54,790
workshop Xerox use me workshop one

01:11:52,990 --> 01:11:55,780
however you would like to lay it out you

01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:57,250
don't have to do the same thing that

01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:58,990
I've done feel free to manipulate the

01:11:57,250 --> 01:12:00,580
HTML if you want to in fact one of these

01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:02,920
I really want to do is come in here and

01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:04,960
get rid of that wrapper div I don't want

01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:06,160
that to exist I don't need that so I can

01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,680
get rid of it now everything's gonna be

01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:10,900
broken but it's very easy for me to go

01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:13,960
and fix it because all I have to do is

01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:15,910
take advantage of the really handy host

01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:17,350
selector that says grab a hold of the

01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:19,450
element that I'm sitting inside of and

01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:21,700
style it accordingly I need to change

01:12:19,450 --> 01:12:23,800
the dot sandbox rule down here as well

01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:26,200
so that it says everything inside the

01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:29,260
host element but now we're back in

01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:32,310
business so take a few minutes do that

01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:34,690
and then we move on to more cool stuff

01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:37,030
the plan by the way here just so you

01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:38,980
know is we're probably going to do one

01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:39,760
maybe two more workshops but if we do

01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:41,020
two there'll be

01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:44,130
we were really short when combined with

01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:46,210
one of the other ones and the last

01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:47,590
half-hour third of these things it's

01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:49,420
mainly me showing you some of the things

01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:51,250
that you can do if we stopped and did

01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:52,660
workshops for them they take up all the

01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:54,460
remaining time but I don't want you to

01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:55,930
leave here without an understanding of

01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:58,690
the kind of crazy stuff you can get up

01:12:55,930 --> 01:13:00,850
to with grit because if if in your mind

01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:03,910
you're thinking okay cool it's great for

01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:05,860
page layout I totally get that it is but

01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:07,690
that's not the entire story or it's

01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:09,640
great for things that are rectangles

01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:11,440
with borders on them it is but that's

01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:12,580
not the entire story there's so much

01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,350
more that you can do with grid and

01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:16,060
several of the examples are about

01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:17,950
showing off some of those things and

01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:19,989
showing that you're not limited to to

01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:22,360
just the fairly conservative things that

01:13:19,989 --> 01:13:24,790
we've done so far before we completely

01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:26,470
move on from this particular workshop I

01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:28,060
wanted to show you a couple of things

01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:29,140
that we're going to get into more detail

01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:33,430
on here in the next couple of steps

01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:37,900
first of all this is what we were

01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:40,510
working with before we had our 300 pixel

01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:42,070
high header we had specific column

01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:43,630
widths that we had set up and if you

01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:47,140
notice one of things that we've lost is

01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:49,270
that beautiful full-page thing that we

01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:50,950
had going on earlier so adding grids

01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:53,230
seems to like taking us a step backwards

01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:55,330
we can totally put that back and in fact

01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:56,860
that's a great way to introduce one of

01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:58,360
the more wonderful features of grid and

01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:01,570
that's what's known as the fractional

01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:03,400
unit the FR unit where you can say i

01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:06,640
don't know how much space i have but i

01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:10,150
would like to take this chunk of it so

01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:12,400
let's try that over here instead of 500

01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:14,410
pixels what I really want to do is take

01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,210
up all of the remaining space I want my

01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:18,880
leftmost column to be 200 pixels wide

01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:21,280
but then I want my right-hand column to

01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,710
just take up the room it needs the room

01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:26,739
it has available and I can say one fr to

01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:27,640
do that and now when i refresh notice

01:14:26,739 --> 01:14:29,580
that we're stretching all the way across

01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:32,680
the page again this is great and in fact

01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:33,460
if the page changes size it changes

01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,440
right along with it

01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:37,120
notice the padding is maintained we

01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,130
haven't lost anything we're no no scroll

01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:42,310
bars at the bottom everything's

01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:44,500
hunky-dory and in fact I'm not limited

01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:47,020
to just one of those I could say that I

01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:48,400
want a fraction of the room on the left

01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:51,670
and a fraction on the room on the right

01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,300
and now I'm going to end up with half

01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:54,949
and half

01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:56,300
because it's taking all those FRS that

01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:57,829
you're adding to get it's like adding

01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:00,050
them all up and says okay they've asked

01:14:57,829 --> 01:15:02,540
for one fr and another fr that's 2 FRS

01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:03,949
and then they want this one to be one of

01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:09,590
those wide and the other one to be one

01:15:03,949 --> 01:15:10,429
of those wide so 50% 50% this may not

01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:11,989
seem like a big deal

01:15:10,429 --> 01:15:13,610
but it is huge it is really really

01:15:11,989 --> 01:15:14,989
helpful in fact I'm lying to you about

01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:17,480
the percent thing because that wouldn't

01:15:14,989 --> 01:15:19,099
actually work here let's try it with 50%

01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:22,340
and 50% because that seems like a really

01:15:19,099 --> 01:15:25,190
natural thing to do but notice what's

01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:27,469
happened we have the dreaded horizontal

01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:29,570
scroll bar at the bottom we've got a

01:15:27,469 --> 01:15:31,849
little bit of jag back and forth and the

01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:34,520
reason for that is why well we defined

01:15:31,849 --> 01:15:36,949
our grid with a 50 pixel gap in the

01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:38,380
middle we want that gap we want the

01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:40,699
things to be separated from one another

01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:43,219
but then we set our columns were

01:15:40,699 --> 01:15:44,750
individually 50% each and so 50% of the

01:15:43,219 --> 01:15:46,340
width plus another 50% of the width plus

01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:49,070
another 50 pixels means we get a

01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:50,630
horizontal scrollbar if our units don't

01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:52,429
have this problem they are sensitive to

01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:56,030
the way the grid actually works so we

01:15:52,429 --> 01:15:58,219
can say one fr 3 fr for example and now

01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:59,869
it says one quarter of the room is going

01:15:58,219 --> 01:16:02,590
to go over here and three quarters are

01:15:59,869 --> 01:16:05,360
going to go over there this also works

01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:06,860
vertically so you can say you want to

01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:09,920
take up space so if you like define a

01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:11,719
height for your entire viewport or for

01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:13,670
what you want to use in your of your

01:16:11,719 --> 01:16:16,820
viewport you can take up fractional

01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:20,570
elements of it so I'll see that in a

01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:23,119
little more action if I go in here I'm

01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:25,670
gonna go to the pretty step remember

01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:27,619
space theme whew so it's just a simple

01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:29,570
image gallery but it's an image gallery

01:16:27,619 --> 01:16:31,550
that takes advantage of that fr unit

01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:33,770
stuff so if I come in here and start

01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:36,020
resizing the browser notice what's

01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:38,090
happening to the images they're getting

01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:41,150
slightly narrower until there's not

01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:46,489
enough room anymore and then we break

01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:48,469
across rows so this is using the fr in

01:16:46,489 --> 01:16:50,420
conjunction with some other really nifty

01:16:48,469 --> 01:16:52,520
grid stuff in order to make this gallery

01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:54,290
very squishy remember I said that

01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,639
flexbox is all about flexibility and

01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:57,560
squishiness but you could get a lot of

01:16:55,639 --> 01:16:59,000
that with grid as well the fr unit is

01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:00,770
often where that squishiness is going to

01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,240
come in that extra flexibility that you

01:17:00,770 --> 01:17:08,120
want so we look at this one

01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:10,070
this is our image gallery first thing

01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:11,810
we've got a little more going on in our

01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:13,430
component type script that we did before

01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:14,390
but I'm only bringing it up so I can

01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:14,930
tell you you don't really need to worry

01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:17,930
about it

01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:21,170
it is going to my space images service

01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:23,870
and grabbing the planetary nebula set of

01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:25,790
images that 80 plus megabytes that you

01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:29,450
downloaded earlier it's some of those

01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:30,830
pictures so congratulations you now have

01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:33,410
a set of planetary nebulae on your

01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:35,000
computer and there is right where they

01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:38,090
all landed so how do we make that happen

01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:40,370
well in the HTML not a real shock it's

01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:42,350
just an image element repeated as many

01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:45,230
times as you have one of these planetary

01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:48,200
image objects and we're grabbing the

01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:50,120
thumbnail out of it and again saying

01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:52,270
grab the or put a title on it so it's

01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:54,320
easy to grab with our CSS if we want to

01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:56,870
so nothing really exciting in the

01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:58,820
typescript or the HTML and that's a

01:17:56,870 --> 01:18:00,950
feature we don't want too much a layout

01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:03,110
crap in our HTML we just want to say

01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:04,910
here's the stuff now put the stuff where

01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:06,740
it actually belongs the place where you

01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:11,300
define where it belongs is in the CSS

01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:12,680
and in the CSS here is our definition no

01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:15,320
big surprise we start off with a display

01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:17,600
grid we've said we want 20 pixels in

01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:20,420
between each elements each item each

01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:22,370
cell of the grid we've done a little bit

01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:24,380
of additional work just to make the

01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:25,700
thing slightly more appealing so we give

01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:27,500
it that gray background color so those

01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:29,600
black images with the cool space images

01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:31,760
begin to pop we put a little bit of

01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,910
padding around the whole thing so that

01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:36,550
they're not slammed up against the wall

01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:38,270
but the magic is right there I

01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:39,920
specifically include this example

01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:42,590
because you will see some version of

01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:46,310
this pattern over and over and over

01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:48,020
again it seems a bit complicated but

01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:49,220
after you've seen it 500 times the way

01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,930
that I have now you'll be able to type

01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:53,720
it with your eyes closed it's

01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:55,670
essentially saying that we are going to

01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:57,380
want to automatically fill up the

01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:58,790
available space that we have in this

01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:02,930
case horizontally because we're dealing

01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:05,540
with columns and we want to make sure

01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:09,950
that everything is at least 150 pixels

01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:12,110
wide but can take up to one fraction of

01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:13,760
the available space well what is one

01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:16,940
fraction available space and the answer

01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:20,690
is it totally depends on how much room

01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:24,500
there is to work with so as we move the

01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:26,469
browser back and forth everything is

01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:29,449
changing and squeezing and moving around

01:19:26,469 --> 01:19:30,800
because we've said take up the room that

01:19:29,449 --> 01:19:34,580
you've got but don't ever let anything

01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:38,420
get narrower than 150 pixels so this

01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:41,510
repeat plus autofill plus min Max and a

01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:43,010
lower bound and the 1f are very very

01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:45,440
common pattern that's that's basically a

01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:48,140
magic spell in grid you will use it over

01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:50,480
and over and over again everything else

01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:52,489
in here just details we've said that our

01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:54,050
image elements should take up all the

01:19:52,489 --> 01:19:55,940
available room that they have within the

01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:58,250
cell that we're working with and we're

01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:59,840
doing object fit to cover not

01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:01,580
specifically a grid thing but it's a

01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,590
it's a wonderful fairly recent addition

01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:06,199
to CSS well recent as these things go

01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:07,940
that simply says I'm going to want to

01:20:06,199 --> 01:20:10,460
put this image and have it not get

01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:12,140
squeezed and change the aspect ratio I

01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:15,020
want it to like fit in the middle of

01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:16,760
this thing so if you notice as we begin

01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:19,310
moving around the individual images

01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:22,790
Sebago zoom in and show you they are

01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:25,880
actually changing a little bit getting a

01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:28,070
bit narrower but we're keeping the image

01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,969
basically in the middle so you want to

01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:32,000
see some cool tricks you can do with

01:20:28,969 --> 01:20:33,080
images object fit : cover contain and a

01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,090
bunch of other settings that you can use

01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:38,480
that make stuff like this super easy to

01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:42,530
do again not specific to grid but really

01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:44,330
really handy to have around so there's

01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:46,790
not a lot going on here but there is a

01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:48,680
lot going on here the fr unit is your

01:20:46,790 --> 01:20:51,739
best friend think of that fr friend you

01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:53,810
will use it all the time don't use

01:20:51,739 --> 01:20:56,630
percentages they're almost never useful

01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:59,150
in grid because you almost always end up

01:20:56,630 --> 01:21:00,380
having to do some horrific calc call in

01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:01,940
order to make percentages make sense

01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:02,660
when you should have just reach for F R

01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,430
in the first place

01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:05,570
fr is what you're gonna want to use the

01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:11,060
set of percentages it just makes things

01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:12,680
so much easier alright a couple of

01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:14,449
things that I jumped over to get to the

01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:17,270
to the image gallery the good grids gone

01:21:14,449 --> 01:21:20,330
bad is mostly an excuse to play with the

01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:21,530
debugging tools but there is a new thing

01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:23,900
in here we haven't seen before so don't

01:21:21,530 --> 01:21:27,679
want to completely skip over it notice

01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:28,880
seven and three turns out that one of

01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:30,350
the coolest features of grid is the

01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,630
ability to overlap elements

01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:33,920
so far we haven't seen that headers been

01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:34,970
where the header goes and the content

01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,440
goes where the content goes and the

01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:38,120
footer goes where the footer' goes but

01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:40,040
it turns out that you can overlap things

01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:41,360
very very easily in grid so I'm going to

01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:42,350
show you a simple example of this and

01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:47,600
then show you one it's a little more

01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:49,970
realistic so in the debugging step again

01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:54,050
we've got a whole bunch of labelled divs

01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:56,750
just like we had before we've got those

01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:57,770
divs laid out in the HTML but with no

01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:59,540
styling

01:21:57,770 --> 01:22:02,840
no no layout applied to them directly

01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:04,820
and then in the CSS we've said how we

01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:06,140
want the grid to work well this was a

01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:07,820
much simpler definition we simply said

01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:09,470
we want five columns and 5 rows each of

01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:13,400
the hundred pixels wide same definition

01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:14,720
we've seen before but down here we

01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:18,530
started positioning things so that they

01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:23,030
deliberately overlap notice three starts

01:22:18,530 --> 01:22:29,720
in column one goes three cells wide if

01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:32,360
we look down further seven specifically

01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:35,300
takes up one column all the way to the

01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:36,590
left hand side that's how I end up with

01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:39,350
this whole thing stretching top to

01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:41,540
bottom it didn't specifically say a span

01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:44,750
it simply said start at the beginning go

01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:47,390
to the end well turns out that that

01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:49,070
overlaps with three and that's totally

01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:51,170
cool there's nothing wrong with that

01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:53,090
that's not an error it's not a bug you

01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:54,260
want to take advantage of it I don't

01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:55,220
know how much work you've ever had to do

01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:57,110
with like absolute and relative

01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,940
positioning and z-index and all that

01:22:57,110 --> 01:23:01,070
grid makes stuff like that so much

01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:03,050
easier you can lay out your page and

01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:04,640
then simply say I want these things here

01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:06,140
and these to be on top of them and you

01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:10,310
can use the index to determine the order

01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:15,200
really really easy to do little more

01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:19,010
exciting version of that is the point

01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:21,350
worlds collide space-themed whoo now

01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:24,380
I've specifically set this up so that

01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:26,770
most of the smaller planets Venus and

01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:29,300
Mars and Earth are taking up one by one

01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:30,140
but Saturn's taking up more room

01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:31,370
horizontally

01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:33,230
Jupiter's taking up more room both

01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:34,580
horizontally and vertically and then

01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:37,070
I've explicitly positioned some other

01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:38,270
things in odd places inside the grid it

01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:39,290
gives me a chance to show off some of

01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:40,130
the things you can do that we've talked

01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:44,530
about and some of the things that we

01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:44,530
haven't seen before so in here

01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:58,040
overlap there we go here's our HTML

01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,750
we're just putting out pictures of

01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:01,610
planets so in this case instead of

01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:04,070
grabbing the planetary nebulae we grab

01:24:01,610 --> 01:24:06,320
the planets themselves that's what the

01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:09,380
typescript does for us it simply says

01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:11,540
grab ahold of the planets we're seeing

01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:14,030
them one image at a time everything is

01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:15,290
really happening in the CSS same

01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:16,880
definition they'll be soon to seen

01:24:15,290 --> 01:24:18,470
before all the way down to the to the

01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,030
grid gap I've done a little bit of

01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:21,680
alignment stuff just to make sure things

01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:23,180
show up in the upper left hand corner of

01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:25,430
each one of these items didn't really

01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:27,260
need to do that here but it gave me a

01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:29,510
chance to talk about the ability that

01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:31,490
you have to align things individually if

01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:33,020
you want to but over the entire grid

01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:34,220
which is often what you want to do we've

01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:37,730
seen a little bit of this already with

01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:39,470
the place short shorthand so in this

01:24:37,730 --> 01:24:41,410
case we're simply saying a line in other

01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:43,010
words move things vertically to the top

01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:45,620
but we could have also done

01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:47,560
justification here if we wanted to each

01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:50,030
one of the images is going to take up

01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:52,100
100% of its available width of the

01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:53,120
container I've given it a border just to

01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:55,250
make that border a little more obvious

01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:57,410
I'll change that to red so you can see

01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:59,030
it and you'll see that each one of these

01:24:57,410 --> 01:25:01,310
things is really just taking up the size

01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:02,660
of the images we've specified it that by

01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:04,820
the way is also a wonderful debugging

01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:07,400
trick a lot of people I'm surprised

01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:09,590
don't know about the outline property

01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,670
people use borders for this all the time

01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:12,640
and there's nothing really wrong with

01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:15,290
that except that borders take up space

01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:16,400
outline specifically lives outside of

01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:17,810
your element and doesn't take up any

01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:20,180
space so if you really want to like see

01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:23,030
where a thing is without having the the

01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:24,800
border affect the positioning outline is

01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:26,000
actually what you want now admittedly

01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,350
you probably should be using like a

01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,390
debugging tool like the chrome dev tools

01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:33,650
or Firefox but sometimes you just want

01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:35,540
console.log for CSS and that is it all

01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:40,100
right so here's where we start

01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:41,510
positioning things we put in hello we

01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,850
put mercury up in the upper left hand

01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:45,140
corner or excuse me

01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:47,900
we use the negative one so we put it

01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:51,440
specifically in the right hand bottom

01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:53,840
corner so this is mercury right here

01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:55,210
earth we put at a specific row and

01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:57,550
column index

01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:58,960
so that's how I ended up here we could

01:25:57,550 --> 01:26:01,720
have also counted backwards if we wanted

01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:04,240
to so far all stuff that you've seen

01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:05,560
before Saturn and Jupiter a little more

01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:07,600
interesting because they're taking up

01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:09,580
more room and they're being told to

01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,380
start at specific places so in this case

01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:13,570
we've said that Jupiter is going to

01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:16,240
start in row 3 and span for two of them

01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:18,130
and whatever column it's in is going to

01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:19,660
span for two of those as well so that's

01:26:18,130 --> 01:26:24,070
how Jupiter ends up taking up so much

01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:26,020
additional space Saturn same idea except

01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:28,200
we specified not only the amount of room

01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:31,570
it takes up but also where it starts and

01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:32,980
those things can totally overlap so we

01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:34,900
said that Saturn is going to start in

01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:37,210
column three and span for three let's

01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:43,420
see what happens if we put Jupiter in

01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:45,820
column three just what you'd expect

01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:47,590
now Saturn is on top of Jupiter and so

01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:49,180
is Earth because I snuck something in

01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:51,940
there while we're watching I said that

01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:53,200
Earth has a Z index of 1 so everything

01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:57,940
else where the Z index of zero is going

01:26:53,200 --> 01:27:00,340
to be behind it Earth wins moral of the

01:26:57,940 --> 01:27:01,660
story is grid is fantastic not only for

01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:03,370
like positioning things in an absolute

01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:05,770
way but you are not limited at all in

01:27:03,370 --> 01:27:07,000
overlapping those things so if like me

01:27:05,770 --> 01:27:08,770
you've ever struggled with relative

01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
positioning absolute positioning trying

01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:12,460
to get things on top of other things

01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,970
this is a great way to do it without

01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:18,030
having to struggle with all that stuff

01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:18,030
all right

01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:26,550
so I've told you about the the grid

01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:28,230
template grid template arias thing and

01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:29,760
it's been really cool but we've used it

01:27:28,230 --> 01:27:31,260
for basically really simple stuff at

01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:33,630
this point I want to show you how you

01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:35,610
can stretch it you can really kind of go

01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:37,320
crazy with it so breaking away from the

01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:39,780
space theme for a moment let's take a

01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:41,970
look at a deck of cards these are not

01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:44,640
pictures there are pictures here but the

01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:46,200
pictures are the faces on the face cards

01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:50,100
everything else that you see here is

01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:54,360
actually done with HTML and CSS so if i

01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:57,900
zoom out we've got all the cards all

01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:59,610
four suits all the ranks what we're

01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:00,720
doing is we're generating each one of

01:27:59,610 --> 01:28:02,730
those things so if I look in here in the

01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,930
playing cards example you'll see that

01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:04,860
I've set up a little more component

01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:07,830
action than we've had before

01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:09,360
we've got suits and we got ranks that

01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:13,320
gives us things to iterate over from our

01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:14,820
HTML in our HTML we've said that for

01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:17,400
each one of the suits and each one of

01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:19,190
their ranks we want to show a playing

01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,820
card

01:28:19,190 --> 01:28:23,190
everybody here familiar with energy

01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:25,530
container if you're not you are going to

01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:27,690
love me energy container is fantastic

01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:29,220
because it's a way of attaching logic

01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:30,810
inside of a template without actually

01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:32,510
having that need without needing an

01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:34,680
element for that logic to go along with

01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:36,300
energy container disappears at runtime

01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:38,430
you just end up with whatever you

01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:39,600
generated so in this case we're

01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:41,610
essentially using these for their

01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,990
looping capability but there are no

01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:44,970
elements in the Dom once we're done the

01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:47,430
only thing we end up with is a bunch of

01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:49,950
playing cards if I inspect this you'll

01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:54,330
see that apart from some comments that

01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:58,890
show where ng container was all we have

01:28:54,330 --> 01:29:00,410
are playing cards so in here I want to

01:28:58,890 --> 01:29:02,610
back up there we go

01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:05,130
there's our individual playing card

01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:07,680
collapse this guy lots and lots and lots

01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:09,960
of playing cards courtesy of ng

01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:12,150
container again nothing to do with grid

01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:13,830
but given the way that grid works and

01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:15,960
the fact that grid works unlike direct

01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:17,640
children or whatever container you using

01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:19,290
oftentimes in G container is the thing

01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,760
that you want to reach for in order to

01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:22,950
make sure that you only have elements at

01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:24,770
the level you want them alright so now

01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:26,940
we have a whole bunch of playing card

01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:28,290
components which means that we finally

01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:30,210
get to do a little bit of angular stuff

01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:32,400
and look at a completely separate

01:29:30,210 --> 01:29:34,200
component here's our playing card

01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,450
component and you might think things are

01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,190
going to

01:29:34,450 --> 01:29:38,440
really crazy in the HTML will they do

01:29:36,190 --> 01:29:39,970
but maybe not in the way you expect this

01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:43,510
is what a playing card looks like when

01:29:39,970 --> 01:29:45,970
you put it under an x-ray in HTML so we

01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:48,610
have an entire wrapper div of playing

01:29:45,970 --> 01:29:50,350
card with an additional class of front

01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:52,960
around it so there's a good excuse to

01:29:50,350 --> 01:29:56,800
actually have a wrapper div and we're

01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:57,910
applying a specific class to it now

01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,950
we're gonna see how that gets used in

01:29:57,910 --> 01:30:02,260
just a second and then we've got the

01:29:59,950 --> 01:30:03,850
rank in one corner and an inverted rank

01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:05,140
in the lower right-hand corner this is

01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:08,140
the structure of a playing card here's

01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:12,010
our rank in the top left and our rank in

01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:15,040
the bottom right flipped over we've got

01:30:12,010 --> 01:30:16,600
the suit that we're working with but

01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:18,510
it's in the form of this PIP that's what

01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:21,760
these things are actually called pips

01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:23,200
right there and we've got an inverted

01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:27,700
one down at the bottom for the corner

01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:30,160
and in the middle we have all of the

01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:31,930
stuff we need to do depending on whether

01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:33,790
there's a face for the face card or not

01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:35,020
so if there is a picture associated with

01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:37,420
this thing that's going to be a king or

01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:39,310
a queen or a jack if there's not then

01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:42,160
there's simply no image and then we have

01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:44,740
a div that shows the appropriate number

01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:47,020
of pips for every card so card number

01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:48,280
seven has seven of these symbols but

01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:50,410
notice there's nothing in here that says

01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:52,330
put the seven symbols in a certain

01:30:50,410 --> 01:30:55,570
arrangement all that's happening over in

01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:57,070
the CSS so let's go there now I've done

01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:58,900
this with sass just to make it a little

01:30:57,070 --> 01:31:00,580
bit easier to structure the CSS there's

01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:05,260
nothing sass specific about this other

01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:07,750
than that nesting so our entire host for

01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:09,220
the playing card itself is a display

01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:12,010
block but we're gonna get to display

01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:12,880
grid in just a second so screaming

01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:14,560
through a bunch of this stuff it's

01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,360
mostly about sizing this is the part you

01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:19,660
care about there is the layout for a

01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:21,550
playing card stuff in each corner

01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:24,610
flipped upside down the bottom right

01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:26,560
hand we've got the design in the middle

01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:29,560
and notice the design is going to take

01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:31,780
up three chunks in the middle so it's

01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:33,730
horizontally centered and vertically

01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:35,410
centered but taking up a specific amount

01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:36,940
of space so we've got plenty of stuff to

01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:38,830
work with to lay out our pips in the

01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:41,950
right way and if we keep going a little

01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:44,860
further down more and more details but

01:31:41,950 --> 01:31:47,030
the really important stuff the really

01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:49,649
important stuff

01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:50,789
we start getting into individual carts

01:31:49,649 --> 01:31:52,619
and I'm just going to scroll through

01:31:50,789 --> 01:31:54,209
them so you can see how this begins to

01:31:52,619 --> 01:31:59,159
look can you guess which one that is

01:31:54,209 --> 01:32:02,189
that's two that's three that's four five

01:31:59,159 --> 01:32:03,929
and so on I'm not recommending you

01:32:02,189 --> 01:32:05,339
actually do this mind you there are

01:32:03,929 --> 01:32:06,869
better ways to show pictures of playing

01:32:05,339 --> 01:32:10,229
cards but mostly what I want to show you

01:32:06,869 --> 01:32:11,999
is how far you can take this whole grid

01:32:10,229 --> 01:32:14,369
template grid template area thing and

01:32:11,999 --> 01:32:16,199
notice each one of them not only has the

01:32:14,369 --> 01:32:17,789
template the layout for the card but

01:32:16,199 --> 01:32:19,439
also measurements associated with it

01:32:17,789 --> 01:32:21,149
I could have simplified this a little

01:32:19,439 --> 01:32:23,669
bit but I wanted you see those fr units

01:32:21,149 --> 01:32:25,530
in action so each one of these things is

01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:27,659
taking up the appropriate fraction of

01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:31,379
space both horizontally and vertically

01:32:27,659 --> 01:32:33,119
all the way down and then finally at the

01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:36,059
very end after I've got all of those

01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:37,229
individual configurations set up I'm

01:32:36,059 --> 01:32:40,739
associating them with the appropriate

01:32:37,229 --> 01:32:41,789
grid areas for each one so I'm racing

01:32:40,739 --> 01:32:42,869
through this example because we run a

01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:43,800
lot of time but I want you to take a

01:32:42,869 --> 01:32:45,749
look at it later when you get a chance

01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:47,070
and see the tricks that I'm using to

01:32:45,749 --> 01:32:48,689
really take full advantage not only of

01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:52,999
grid but of also several other CSS

01:32:48,689 --> 01:33:00,269
things just to do this ridiculous stunt

01:32:52,999 --> 01:33:02,669
alright so remember I said that we

01:33:00,269 --> 01:33:06,929
weren't at all limited to what we could

01:33:02,669 --> 01:33:09,300
do like nesting wise with grids this is

01:33:06,929 --> 01:33:12,899
a good example of that so here in the I

01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:17,129
object these are all what are called

01:33:12,899 --> 01:33:18,449
media objects I think stubborn Ella came

01:33:17,129 --> 01:33:20,099
up with this Nicole Sullivan a few years

01:33:18,449 --> 01:33:21,570
ago the idea of a media object the

01:33:20,099 --> 01:33:23,489
Internet is kind of made up of these

01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:27,899
media objects if you if you look on

01:33:23,489 --> 01:33:29,309
Facebook you see a picture name and then

01:33:27,899 --> 01:33:30,780
some text and oftentimes those media

01:33:29,309 --> 01:33:32,999
objects are nested inside one another

01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:35,399
well I've built a simple version of this

01:33:32,999 --> 01:33:37,649
so that you've got excuse me a picture a

01:33:35,399 --> 01:33:39,839
name and then a description for each one

01:33:37,649 --> 01:33:41,459
of these these are these are all women

01:33:39,839 --> 01:33:45,749
astronomers and astrophysicists by the

01:33:41,459 --> 01:33:49,379
way and just like with our images these

01:33:45,749 --> 01:33:51,929
things scale intelligently and once you

01:33:49,379 --> 01:33:55,169
get below a certain level begin to

01:33:51,929 --> 01:33:56,519
change the way that they wrap so you're

01:33:55,169 --> 01:33:58,800
not just limited to cool tricks with

01:33:56,519 --> 01:33:59,909
images these are individual angular

01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,369
components that have a

01:33:59,909 --> 01:34:05,489
grid inside of them and that grid is set

01:34:02,369 --> 01:34:10,679
up to like be responsive within whatever

01:34:05,489 --> 01:34:14,489
responsive shell you've given it so here

01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:16,050
in our example for media objects we're

01:34:14,489 --> 01:34:17,729
showing one of these media object

01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:21,659
components for every one of the items in

01:34:17,729 --> 01:34:23,519
our list all we're doing in the

01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:24,840
typescript is grabbing our data set that

01:34:23,519 --> 01:34:26,249
we're playing with so this is where all

01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,689
the women in astronomy are coming from

01:34:26,249 --> 01:34:29,130
and then in order to not play favorites

01:34:27,689 --> 01:34:30,360
I'm shuffling the array every time I

01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:34,739
look at it so that different people show

01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:35,699
up at the top then finally in CSS here's

01:34:34,739 --> 01:34:37,499
all I had to do in order to make that

01:34:35,699 --> 01:34:38,789
work now this is the overall grid this

01:34:37,499 --> 01:34:40,800
is not the individual cards the

01:34:38,789 --> 01:34:43,469
individual media objects but I wanted to

01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:46,260
lay them out a certain way look familiar

01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:49,139
we're repeating automatically filling

01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:51,989
with a min/max can't get any lower than

01:34:49,139 --> 01:34:53,999
300 pixels wide but we can go up to one

01:34:51,989 --> 01:34:56,550
over one fraction of whatever space is

01:34:53,999 --> 01:34:58,829
available to us you'll see this over and

01:34:56,550 --> 01:35:01,919
over and over again the individual media

01:34:58,829 --> 01:35:03,989
object itself a bit more complicated the

01:35:01,919 --> 01:35:06,449
HTML is nice and simple it simply says

01:35:03,989 --> 01:35:08,550
take the image take the header take the

01:35:06,449 --> 01:35:10,739
description lay them out in the HTML no

01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:11,969
layout here at all nothing that says put

01:35:10,739 --> 01:35:16,050
them in a certain place other than the

01:35:11,969 --> 01:35:17,729
source order but the CSS says here's all

01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:20,010
the stuff that I want to do to make sure

01:35:17,729 --> 01:35:22,559
that it makes sense so here's my grid

01:35:20,010 --> 01:35:23,760
template we've got our image along the

01:35:22,559 --> 01:35:25,709
left hand side we've got our header

01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,840
above the description the header takes

01:35:25,709 --> 01:35:29,550
up an automatic amount of room the

01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,590
description is going to be at least a

01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:33,030
hundred pixels high but take up up to

01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:35,579
the fraction of available space that you

01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:38,159
have the image is going to be a hundred

01:35:35,579 --> 01:35:41,369
pixels wide and we're gonna go from

01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:42,689
nothing up to 1fr now that's another one

01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:43,979
I want you to commit to memory you're

01:35:42,689 --> 01:35:47,999
eventually going to come up with some

01:35:43,979 --> 01:35:50,070
sort of grid where you're like my items

01:35:47,999 --> 01:35:52,229
are growing in a way that I don't want

01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:56,070
them to and the reason is because 1fr

01:35:52,229 --> 01:35:57,449
really means min/max of auto to 1fr in

01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:59,400
other words take up the space you need

01:35:57,449 --> 01:36:01,169
up to the amount of space available

01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:03,809
sometimes that's not what you want

01:36:01,169 --> 01:36:06,630
sometimes you want to say take up maybe

01:36:03,809 --> 01:36:08,550
nothing and go up to the fraction of

01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:10,260
available space so that min max zero to

01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:11,969
one fr it seems like you should be able

01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:12,199
to just change that to one fr doesn't

01:36:11,969 --> 01:36:14,150
work

01:36:12,199 --> 01:36:16,039
'we min/max to 0 to 1 FR gives you the

01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:18,829
behavior that you often want that's what

01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:20,659
makes this squishiness actually behave

01:36:18,829 --> 01:36:22,429
the right way now there's a bunch of

01:36:20,659 --> 01:36:24,739
other details in here but they're mostly

01:36:22,429 --> 01:36:26,840
about making sure that when we get below

01:36:24,739 --> 01:36:28,729
a certain point that things like these

01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:29,869
headers begin to put ellipses on there

01:36:28,729 --> 01:36:31,280
and they don't wrap in a way that we

01:36:29,869 --> 01:36:33,260
don't want them to but none of that is

01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:35,420
grid specific that's all just plain old

01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:38,989
CSS but it works fantastically well

01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:40,760
inside of grid so here's my header being

01:36:38,989 --> 01:36:42,860
told that it needs to go into the grid

01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:45,199
area called header with all the font

01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:47,119
stuff and then these 3 little bits that

01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:49,579
say make the header do the right thing

01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:56,030
when it gets too narrow so just stuff

01:36:49,579 --> 01:36:57,320
like that alright I think I'm gonna have

01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:58,429
to skip a workshop but there's something

01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,929
that I want to show you that I think

01:36:58,429 --> 01:37:02,630
you're really really dig in fact two

01:36:59,929 --> 01:37:04,820
things back-to-back first of all we're

01:37:02,630 --> 01:37:07,010
all application developers right a lot

01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:08,979
of the stuff has involved things that

01:37:07,010 --> 01:37:10,489
look suspiciously like page layout

01:37:08,979 --> 01:37:13,039
that's ok

01:37:10,489 --> 01:37:14,869
you know pages are still good we have

01:37:13,039 --> 01:37:16,519
pages inside of our applications but a

01:37:14,869 --> 01:37:19,280
lot of times what we want to do is

01:37:16,519 --> 01:37:21,769
actually lay out an application that

01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:24,199
takes up the entire viewport and we own

01:37:21,769 --> 01:37:26,030
the whole space no scrolling or if there

01:37:24,199 --> 01:37:30,289
is scrolling scrolling only on spots we

01:37:26,030 --> 01:37:31,969
want so here under so much room for

01:37:30,289 --> 01:37:33,499
activities we've got a full viewport

01:37:31,969 --> 01:37:35,090
application and notice we had a menu

01:37:33,499 --> 01:37:36,739
slide in from the side now I'm gonna

01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:39,949
resize this whole thing watch what

01:37:36,739 --> 01:37:43,159
happens to the header and the footer see

01:37:39,949 --> 01:37:45,619
how they're staying with me this is not

01:37:43,159 --> 01:37:48,920
always easy to do with grid it's trivial

01:37:45,619 --> 01:37:50,360
this menu can come and go and notice

01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:55,519
it's overlaying so it's slightly

01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:58,280
transparent a grid layout very

01:37:55,519 --> 01:38:01,610
straightforward so here in our full

01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:03,050
viewport we don't really have much going

01:38:01,610 --> 01:38:05,659
on that we haven't seen before inside

01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:07,789
the component it's simply saying gimme a

01:38:05,659 --> 01:38:09,860
set of these spaced posters that's where

01:38:07,789 --> 01:38:10,729
you're seeing there in the middle there

01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:16,880
really cool you should look at him when

01:38:10,729 --> 01:38:19,010
you get a chance the HTML says that we

01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:21,139
have a header section that header

01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:22,849
section has little clothes and open

01:38:21,139 --> 01:38:25,280
button that we're working with and it

01:38:22,849 --> 01:38:27,530
has links inside of it

01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:29,690
excuse me a link inside of it to go back

01:38:27,530 --> 01:38:31,880
to the home for this application we've

01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:33,500
got a nav bar on the left hand side but

01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:35,570
notice it's just in source order so

01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:36,800
we're just dropping elements in the HTML

01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:39,620
we haven't said where any of them

01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:41,000
actually go yet down at the bottom we

01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:42,350
have our main section that's where all

01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,340
of our pretty posters show up and then

01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:45,410
we have a footer that has some

01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:47,960
additional links in it and nothing in

01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:49,940
here that looks like bootstrap layout

01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:51,230
classes nothing in here that says put

01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:53,300
the nav bar on the left and make it

01:38:51,230 --> 01:38:55,040
slide in and out nothing that says keep

01:38:53,300 --> 01:39:00,880
the footer sticky at the bottom all

01:38:55,040 --> 01:39:03,020
that's happening in the CSS so in here

01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,220
more of that grid template action that

01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:07,220
you've seen before but with a couple of

01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:08,780
extra tricks so our header goes across

01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:10,940
both of the columns that we've got

01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:12,380
defined our main section goes across

01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:13,820
both the columns we've got to find and

01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:15,020
our footer goes across both the columns

01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:16,460
so immediately you're thinking why did

01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:18,800
you do that twice why didn't you just

01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:20,930
say header main and footer well that's

01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:23,840
because we've got one other thing we've

01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:27,530
got this little menu that pops in and

01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:29,270
out but it lays over the top of things

01:39:27,530 --> 01:39:30,320
that we defined in our grid template so

01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:33,320
we didn't really have a great way to

01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:37,640
name it in our ASCII art instead what we

01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:40,580
did was we said name the lines on this

01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:42,980
grid so before the beginning of the main

01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:45,920
section and at the end of the main

01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:49,820
section let's call that nav start nav in

01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:50,630
and notice we're doing that for two

01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:52,700
different places

01:39:50,630 --> 01:39:54,350
we've got nav start nav in and we've got

01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:56,510
nav start nav in at the bottom so we've

01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:58,640
got a columnar version of this and a row

01:39:56,510 --> 01:40:00,590
version of this so this one even though

01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:01,910
it's laid out like left to right you

01:40:00,590 --> 01:40:03,680
might think that refers to columns it

01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:06,650
really doesn't it's saying that our

01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:08,960
navigation starts above the main and

01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:13,490
below the main in other words it takes

01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:15,290
up that amount of space but it doesn't

01:40:13,490 --> 01:40:17,990
take up the entire width of the viewport

01:40:15,290 --> 01:40:19,550
it only takes up the left-hand side so

01:40:17,990 --> 01:40:20,750
there's our now start nav in we didn't

01:40:19,550 --> 01:40:22,880
have a way to specify that in the grid

01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:26,060
template but we do have a way to name it

01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:27,770
with the grid lines and the really nifty

01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:29,660
thing is if we name them the way I've

01:40:27,770 --> 01:40:32,210
named them here with the - start and -

01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:35,170
in they become kind of this phantom grid

01:40:32,210 --> 01:40:39,199
area so if we look down at the nav

01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:40,280
definition I said grid area nav

01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:44,690
even though there is nothing in that

01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:49,999
grid template that says nav it's just

01:40:44,690 --> 01:40:53,479
the lines put all that together and that

01:40:49,999 --> 01:40:56,630
means that the nav section has a home

01:40:53,479 --> 01:40:59,709
but I don't always wanted to show up so

01:40:56,630 --> 01:41:01,760
I can send it that way about a mile

01:40:59,709 --> 01:41:05,239
that's exactly what I've done I've said

01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:07,969
translate from where we should be way to

01:41:05,239 --> 01:41:10,280
the left if you look very closely if i

01:41:07,969 --> 01:41:12,650
refresh this page you see it actually

01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:14,449
comes swooping in that's because when I

01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:16,579
first start up the application I bring

01:41:14,449 --> 01:41:18,159
it from where it was over onto the page

01:41:16,579 --> 01:41:21,019
you can actually see the menu show up

01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:23,030
the important takeaway from this is that

01:41:21,019 --> 01:41:24,679
just because grid says where things go

01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:26,719
on a page doesn't mean they have to stay

01:41:24,679 --> 01:41:29,800
there you've still got the ability to

01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:32,239
transform stuff and move it around so

01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:37,119
two important idea is to take away here

01:41:32,239 --> 01:41:37,119
one is the ability to define the entire

01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:41,929
viewport so we've done that in several

01:41:40,699 --> 01:41:43,579
ways already but they'd always like

01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:45,949
scrolled so there's one other piece and

01:41:43,579 --> 01:41:47,780
that is to say that the entire height

01:41:45,949 --> 01:41:49,459
that we're working with is 100 percent

01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:50,690
of the viewport so we didn't want to

01:41:49,459 --> 01:41:52,070
stretch beyond it we don't want it to be

01:41:50,690 --> 01:41:55,219
too small we wanted to take up all of

01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:56,630
that room that's 100 VH and then we lay

01:41:55,219 --> 01:41:58,969
out the grid on top of it to put

01:41:56,630 --> 01:42:00,050
everything where we care about and then

01:41:58,969 --> 01:42:02,030
we have the ability to use things like

01:42:00,050 --> 01:42:03,979
transforms to move things off of the

01:42:02,030 --> 01:42:10,010
grid and you can go really crazy with

01:42:03,979 --> 01:42:14,179
that stuff for example here's a bunch of

01:42:10,010 --> 01:42:15,499
female astronauts and I've drawn in the

01:42:14,179 --> 01:42:19,280
background if you look very carefully

01:42:15,499 --> 01:42:22,699
see that grey line that's actually the

01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:23,840
border around the grid element the thing

01:42:22,699 --> 01:42:25,909
that we're sitting inside of but if you

01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:28,610
notice these pictures they're not

01:42:25,909 --> 01:42:29,869
staying within that area in fact not

01:42:28,610 --> 01:42:31,010
only are they not staying within an area

01:42:29,869 --> 01:42:34,969
they're they're breaking out a little

01:42:31,010 --> 01:42:36,800
bit they can break way out so we have

01:42:34,969 --> 01:42:38,539
the ability to transform animate do

01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,860
whatever we want to do in order to pick

01:42:38,539 --> 01:42:41,150
these things up and move them around so

01:42:39,860 --> 01:42:43,639
the grid says where they would naturally

01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:44,780
be once you've got them where they would

01:42:43,639 --> 01:42:50,630
naturally be you can put them wherever

01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:52,849
you want and you can use this for more

01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:53,300
than just you know nifty playing card

01:42:52,849 --> 01:42:57,740
views of

01:42:53,300 --> 01:43:02,390
or knots like this so here's a video

01:42:57,740 --> 01:43:04,520
player so on this if I select one of

01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:06,230
these videos you see the video player

01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:08,180
show up and if the internet cooperates

01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:10,730
you see the video player eventually show

01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:13,130
up as well and I can scroll through and

01:43:10,730 --> 01:43:15,650
pick a different one pick a different

01:43:13,130 --> 01:43:17,390
one everything's hunky-dory this is all

01:43:15,650 --> 01:43:19,730
laid out with grid which is a little bit

01:43:17,390 --> 01:43:21,530
surprising because this thing is like

01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:23,480
coming towards you and tilted sideways

01:43:21,530 --> 01:43:24,680
and how is all that working well it's

01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:31,940
all done the same way that I just showed

01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:34,700
you where we have the video player and

01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:36,260
that video viewer has just a handful of

01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:38,360
elements on it we've got a video list

01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:40,690
and a player at the bottom that's like

01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:44,740
the the entire template is right there

01:43:40,690 --> 01:43:44,740
everything else is happening in the CSS

01:43:44,830 --> 01:43:50,570
where I say here's how I want my grid to

01:43:48,230 --> 01:43:52,270
be laid out and I want it to take up a

01:43:50,570 --> 01:43:54,560
hundred percent of the viewport height I

01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:57,470
want it to have a list on the left hand

01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,310
side a dead cell in the middle of it

01:43:57,470 --> 01:43:59,420
that I'm not actually going to put

01:43:58,310 --> 01:44:01,280
anything inside of so I'm not going to

01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:03,080
name it the player on the right hand

01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:06,110
side that's going to take up as much

01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:07,760
room as it needs to and then the list on

01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:09,650
the left is going to be at minimum 200

01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:11,930
pixels but up to one and a half of the

01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:13,220
fractional space available the dead zone

01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:14,420
is going to be half of the fractional

01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:16,040
space so I leave a little bit of gap

01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:18,140
between my video list and my video

01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:20,660
player and then on the right hand side

01:44:18,140 --> 01:44:22,310
it's just more the same the video player

01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:24,470
has got to be at least 250 pixels wide

01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:27,980
up to two and a half times the available

01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:31,060
space everything else in here is me

01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:34,280
getting really freaky with perspective

01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:36,710
so I'm transforming translating rotating

01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:39,770
I'm making the actual list itself bigger

01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:42,020
than the viewport so if I look in here

01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:44,480
at all the places where I'm using VH

01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:46,700
units notice the video list is a hundred

01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:49,280
and thirty percent of the viewport

01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:50,690
height that's why it's stretching off

01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:53,030
the top and stretching off the bottom

01:44:50,690 --> 01:44:54,320
still grid it's still using grid to put

01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:56,300
everything where it belongs but then

01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,680
taking those things moving them twisting

01:44:56,300 --> 01:45:00,040
them and stretching them wherever I want

01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,040
them to go

01:45:03,620 --> 01:45:07,320
this is arguably the most complicated

01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:08,550
part of the entire example and I say

01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:10,880
that because I don't understand it I

01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:14,400
found it and it worked

01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:16,140
it makes the cool holes on the side of

01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:20,400
the filmstrip and if you understand it

01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:27,210
you're better than I am all right let's

01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:29,460
bring it home last a little bit I talked

01:45:27,210 --> 01:45:31,679
about perspective and how you can do all

01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:33,179
sorts of really cool things with grid so

01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:36,210
it seems weird that I would I would go

01:45:33,179 --> 01:45:38,370
back to the most boring grid possible

01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:39,840
just a chessboard it's not just a

01:45:38,370 --> 01:45:43,320
chessboard in the same way that

01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:45,000
individual grid items can be respected

01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:47,219
and transformed and translated in all

01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,350
that you're not limited to the grid

01:45:47,219 --> 01:45:49,920
itself being this flat thing on your

01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:57,800
screen

01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:57,800
so this chess board let's flip around I

01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:06,840
wish my microphone keep working and put

01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:07,800
it back where it started rotate it so

01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,679
the reason I'm showing this to you is

01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:12,780
because I want you to realize

01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:14,640
rectangular areas aren't really as

01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:16,380
limiting isn't my first sound because

01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:19,650
you can take and turn your grid around

01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:22,290
turn things sideways tilt shift pan

01:46:19,650 --> 01:46:24,090
whatever you want to do and when you

01:46:22,290 --> 01:46:27,540
combine that with things like the

01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:34,790
ability to do animation of grid gap you

01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:34,790
can go from chess board to dance floor

01:46:35,719 --> 01:46:41,760
moral of the story grid is 19 kinds of

01:46:39,719 --> 01:46:43,679
awesome you want it in your life if

01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:45,120
you've experimented with grid before but

01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:46,469
you've stuck to like the spans and the

01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:48,330
rows and the columns things like that

01:46:46,469 --> 01:46:49,710
and thought well this is good but I

01:46:48,330 --> 01:46:51,449
don't get what all hype is about

01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:53,130
hopefully I've convinced you that there

01:46:51,449 --> 01:46:54,660
is more here to look at wish we'd gotten

01:46:53,130 --> 01:46:56,160
a chance to do a couple more workshops

01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:57,810
because I did want you to get a chance

01:46:56,160 --> 01:47:00,210
to build one of these fuel full viewport

01:46:57,810 --> 01:47:01,440
things but they're there all the

01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:03,810
workshops are out there zero one two

01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:05,219
three four and all of the examples that

01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:06,900
we've looked at as well as a handful of

01:47:05,219 --> 01:47:09,870
examples that we didn't get to so please

01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:12,480
play with it take a look really explore

01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:17,120
it there is a lot to love here last

01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:17,120
thing I've given you some resources

01:47:17,179 --> 01:47:20,580

01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:23,160
popping up over and over and over again

01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:26,420
