Description: 
	Can you escape a black hole?

Current science suggests that a black hole’s gravity is so strong that even light cannot escape once inside. In the same way, Angular provides Interceptors as a mechanism to “catch” outgoing requests or incoming responses. This feature can be really useful for some scenarios like adding an Authorization header to each request, logging or doing redirections according received Http Codes.
