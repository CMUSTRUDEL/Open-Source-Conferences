Title: Black Holes and Angular Interceptors | Luis Avlies
Publication date: 2019-05-02
Playlist: ng-conf 2019
Description: 
	Can you escape a black hole?

Current science suggests that a black hole’s gravity is so strong that even light cannot escape once inside. In the same way, Angular provides Interceptors as a mechanism to “catch” outgoing requests or incoming responses. This feature can be really useful for some scenarios like adding an Authorization header to each request, logging or doing redirections according received Http Codes.

[Music]

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:19,320
hi guys good morning how are you doing

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,720
today ray I'm really excited to be here

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,340
this is my third type and attenzione I'm

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,350
a first time as a speaker at the

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,699
conference and today I'm going to talk

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,630
about black holes and angular

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,460
interceptors I came all the way from

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,840
Cochabamba Bolivia my hometown to be

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,489
here and share my thoughts with the

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,320
community I'm a GD of angular and web

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,360
technologies I am working as a software

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,370
engineer at Hero depths which is a nice

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,860
company where I can get some superpowers

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,300
thanks to our friend frosty and I

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,309
undergone a set of angular gonna be a

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,320
community and enjoy Bolivia conference I

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,420
consider myself as an open-source

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,190
enthusiast and I love to do Astro

00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:02,910
photography so today let's talk about

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:06,439
black holes what I think most of you saw

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:11,760
the very first picture of a black hole

00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:13,799
confirming some they say right it was

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,290
political I love that picture but

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,750
understand where it is think of a star

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,259
at least 10 times more massive than the

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,460
Sun is squeezed into a sphere

00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:26,460
approximately the diameter of select

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,250
City the result is a mysterious table

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,470
with a gravitational field so strong

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,990
that nothing not even the light can

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:39,229
escape in order to understand this

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,229
concept better let's talk about happened

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:49,770
I need you to use this mic because that

00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:52,530
Mike is cut now okay as you can see in

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,679
this animation so the NASA's Swift

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,360
satellite detected intense x-ray flares

00:01:55,679 --> 00:02:00,689
though to be caused by a black hole

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,219
devouring a star but we are at ng-conf

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:06,209
and we would love to know more about

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:09,780
angular right let's talk about angular

00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:12,019
interceptors now HTTP interceptors is a

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,790
major feature of the angular framework

00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:17,610
they provide a way to inspect and

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:22,019
transform HTTP requests from the

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,030
application to the server let's suppose

00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:25,890
we have an angular application that

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,910
needs to send an access token to the

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,920
server to solve this problem we can have

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,160
a black hole interceptor just in the

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,410
middle so that we can catch all outgoing

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:41,390
HTTP requests from the application so

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,390
that we can add the access token to them

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:47,160
the first step to do that is implement

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,260
an authentication service which is a

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,459
class that is going to provide a way to

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,319
set and get the access token the next

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,709
step will be define our black hole

00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:02,010
interceptor that needs to implement HTTP

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,720
interceptor interface that means we are

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,410
going to have an intercept function

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,139
where we can create a clone of the

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:15,419
original HTTP request so that we can add

00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:17,970
authorization header to it next and as a

00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:21,209
good practice we can have a type 3 file

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,880
where we can define an HTTP interceptor

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:28,019
providers array and we can add our first

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,970
angular interceptor to it now finally we

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,840
can use it as part of the providers

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:36,169
array inside of the application module

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,459
in this way we can add more than one

00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:40,440
angular interceptor in the future

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:45,599
without having to update the app module

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:48,689
again so if you are going to run this

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,030
code we'll see that every HTTP request

00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:53,840
of our angular application is going to

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:56,269
be called by our angular interceptor

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,940
and this service is going to transform

00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:02,840
every object and the result will be the

00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:10,790
same HTTP request plus an authorization

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:14,299
header as you can see here other use

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,850
cases about angular interceptor well we

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:19,310
can use interceptors to add other custom

00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:22,310
headers not only the torah' session we

00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:24,350
can do login caching service data we can

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:27,139
implement a lot of service show in

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:29,660
general notifications like this object

00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:33,740
has been created successfully without

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:35,030
having a general notification like this

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,320
object object has been created

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:41,630
successfully if we have a 201 as HTTP

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,780
code from the server for example we can

00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:48,710
do error handling and of course you can

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:50,690
think in your own use case here you can

00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,270
find some useful resources about this

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:56,780
topic and the first link the slides of

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:59,450
this talk I have a project on my github

00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,639
account with the source code that I

00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:04,030
shown before you can take a look on the

00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,530
official angular guide about these

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,289
interceptors and I found an interesting

00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,450
article in angular in the block which is

00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:15,620
top 10 ways to use interceptors in

00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,970
angular I'll be sharing more resources

00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,220
about this topic on my Twitter handle

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,150
you can follow me there I hope you

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:25,840
enjoyed this talk thank you very much

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:27,900
[Applause]

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,900
you
