00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,359
hi everybody

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,119
uh my talk is uh back to basics

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,760
organizing your styles in your angular

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,359
project

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,279
i know this topic is a bit more like

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,720
humble in terms of like the topic but

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,359
like this is a strategy when

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,519
you go from styles to theming uh and

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,000
just introduce myself my name is alex my

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,120
pronouns

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,239
are he him i'm a software engineer based

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,239
on los angeles

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,399
specializing in front end development

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,000
user experience designing products

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,520
currently i'm looking for work so i

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,600
would love to connect if you have like

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,719
opening positions to your company

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,559
and why did i make the stock um i think

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,239
uh given that this is only like five

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,960
minutes i wanted to become like

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,039
practical um and i wanted to be in like

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,640
under five minutes and so

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,879
i wanted to uh tap into my engineering

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,359
ux and product skills and like combine

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,040
all of that into the in into this talk

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,000
um when we have the trends of like

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,560
different like

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,320
um like brands let's say facebook where

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,240
they have like a newer darker theme

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,000
or like uh slack where it took longer to

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,200
make their dark theme

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,439
you know like there are like these are

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,000
these brands and even linkedin right now

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,360
that has a new uh facelift in terms of

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,920
like their ui

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,720
all these have been supported by uh

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,320
styles or css in particular

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,479
and this have involved up throughout

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,840
time and that experience just changed

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,720
from you know you have like a standard

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,479
design

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,320
to creating more themes that becomes

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,680
more accessible especially

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,360
if you want to have a new market let's

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,880
say for developers we have

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,479
that you don't you have screens that are

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,479
both like white

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,479
and screens that are like dark in terms

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,600
of like development

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,320
traditionally when you make um css and

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,159
this is before

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,680
angular reactor all of these frameworks

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,759
come about um

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,360
this is the usual way we do it um you

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,520
just like have the framework for the css

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,360
you may be overriding it maybe a shim

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,439
and then a custom css that you you'd

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,840
make for your own application

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,600
um and when your product becomes like

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,200
bigger it's much harder to manage

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,120
all of those styles especially when you

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,120
have like a lot of css to handle

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,640
and a lot of strategies have been like

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,560
uh made throughout

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,560
the years which is like um object

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,120
oriented css

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,239
where bem is like a block element

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,280
modifiers

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,319
uh smack css for a scalable modularity

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,480
atomic

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,840
multi-layer css atomic and there are so

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,319
many other styles like fun

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,280
um and these have been like making your

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,440
product more

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,720
extensible and make and making our

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,680
styles

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,959
um and in the advent of angular and

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,680
other like frameworks uh

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,080
in component development it became more

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,080
much more robust in terms of like uh

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,400
combining and packaging a component with

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,800
its html javascript organic typescript

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,840
and

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,560
css into like a certain component

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,560
and much love has been given to a lot of

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,159
like uh angular projects in scaling

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,280
especially when you're making components

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,080
as you would notice in your folder

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,800
structure

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,720
you break down into like modules pages

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
guards interceptors et cetera

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,080
but there's not much love when you take

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,680
a look at um like your

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,959
styles it's just like oh you have your

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,920
base styles and you have like your

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,319
styles

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,239
and part of it is because coming back to

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,319
angular

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,319
and especially with the advent that uh

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,680
material design the design language also

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,280
made by google

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:30,319
uh you end up with this like

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,000
uh easy to make a style sheet that when

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,120
you do like the when you do a new app in

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,519
angular and you choose

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,879
scss for theming you can have like

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,319
already an automatic theme that's

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,040
already applied to your application and

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,799
so

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,159
uh there's no point like in managing it

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,599
more but

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,959
what happens if uh and it's easy to make

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,120
more multiple like

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,120
uh themes uh through angular material

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,560
and because of the mixins and uh sas

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,599
three or sess

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,000
it's easy to manage

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,640
um in this article actually this is like

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,200
where you

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,080
they uh kevin matthew bundled it

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,879
together

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,319
nicely and uh the strategy here was to

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,159
create a theme base

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,360
split off the themes into like a theme

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,799
dark and a default

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,200
uh essay file

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,040
then just like add uh this property in

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,759
your angular json and then load your

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,840
theme

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,160
and you create a theme service that

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,400
manages that and voila you have like a

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,440
theme based angular app uh that you can

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,320
change your themes most

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,240
uh in your app but what happens if you

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,639
add like another framework let's say age

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,720
grid or like um like kendo or like maybe

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,960
the one right now like joint js

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,479
um i think it becomes more harder to

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,919
manage all of this branding that you

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,759
want for your gaming

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,360
and so to extend the idea of like

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,160
breaking that three

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,840
of like having like a multiple theme of

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,400
uh these three

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,840
um you want to extend it through like

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,759
each of the frameworks and then have

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,440
your main base as your angular app and

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,120
so i would create something like a

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,759
material default dark and a material

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,320
default and an age grid theme and

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,960
default dark you know and that will make

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,120
it uh

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,800
much more easier to group together all

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,479
the themes that you want

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
um you could start up by just having one

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,639
theme but it makes you ready for

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,320
like making more themes in the future um

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,720
and it would look like this

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,639
uh when you end up having like a default

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,240
and then comparison with a dark

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,160
the default for age grid and the dark

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,039
for age grid and so and so forth i use

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,240
cs

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,840
sas 3 just to make it more faster

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,320
i've done it like in a few hours and i

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,320
have the whole theme all together

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,479
and if you look at these files already

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,400
in a high level it will

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,639
look something like this and in your

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,400
main file it would look something like

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,400
the one that you originally see in

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,680
making or breaking down your styles

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,639
originally like the traditional way and

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,360
i think after that you have a more well

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,400
organized

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,800
styles and i hope uh that uh breakdown

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,960
is

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,360
a good tip for you that i would i will

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,319
show you a demo of like what i've done

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,440
um and it's like actually here i'm a big

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,280
pokemon fan

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,840
um i do like michael it's like which i

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,000
have my plushies here

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,919
um this is just like a one-off like from

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,160
all of the resources that i've done

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,080
uh and then you can have a theme you

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,520
have age grid and then you have material

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,759
we if you don't have a brand if you

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,600
don't have a theme for aging grade it's

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,240
it just becomes white it still becomes

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:27,039
white by then right here so

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:35,840
thank you for listening um

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:35,840
uh that was my talk

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,960
