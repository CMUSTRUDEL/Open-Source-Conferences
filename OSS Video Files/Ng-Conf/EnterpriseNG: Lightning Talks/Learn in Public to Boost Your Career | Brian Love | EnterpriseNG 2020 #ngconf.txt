00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,080
all right cool uh so this is something

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,119
i'm pretty passionate about and

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,359
i thought i would share this with

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,119
everybody today so

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,920
very cool that last talk by the way was

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,199
really cool to watch so nice job

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,880
uh so one of the things about uh being a

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,760
technologist is that we're all learning

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,000
right and so

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,600
even in this conference uh certainly you

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,079
know watching the previous lightning

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,320
talk

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,680
uh watching all the talks this morning

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,360
we're all kind of learning

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,360
as part of our jobs and as part of our

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,600
careers and so i want to ask you a

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,320
question kind of to start out with is

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,120
how do you learn and so you might be

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,440
doing things like

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,239
online courses maybe you do courses on

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,120
egghead or thinkster or pluralsight

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,600
maybe you read blog articles or you read

00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,280
books

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,520
or other technical journals or something

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,320
like that maybe you attend workshops

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,760
uh or conferences like this and so you

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,520
kind of get that in person

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,680
if you will kind of teaching opportunity

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,520
but really what i want to challenge this

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,479
with today is what do you

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,080
do with what you learn so you go out

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,520
there you learn something and then what

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,320
do you do with it and you kind of have

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,479
two choices

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,840
so you can learn in private or you can

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,159
learn in public

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,200
and i get it like we all have jobs you

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,439
got to get that pr

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,880
in uh you know you don't always have

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,479
time to learn in public

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,320
i completely understand and i'm

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,920
certainly not trying to embrace like a

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,439
hustle culture here

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,000
but i do want to challenge us to maybe

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,960
think about learning in public

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,280
and i think that hopefully the this

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,040
isn't being blocked by

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,320
zoom but anyways i think that learning

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,479
in public will actually

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,000
boost your career and let me talk a

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,240
little bit about that

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,200
so what are the benefits to learning in

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,520
public

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,600
well uh first of all you can open source

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,000
what you know

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,600
how about spark some joy in others right

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,159
like maria condo like

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,439
spark that joy of like you know teaching

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,200
somebody something

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,879
you can pass on what you learn for your

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,720
future self uh so

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,640
one of the things i've done is i've

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,160
written blog articles and then honestly

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,360
like six months later i might be in a

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,239
project and i'm like

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,120
oh shoot how did i do that and then i go

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,040
and check out

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,040
my blog article or whatever it is that i

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,800
wrote and i can almost kind of teach

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,720
and pass on that knowledge to my future

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,080
self fame

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,920
maybe probably not but i think you can

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,080
boost your career so i think that's

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,239
certainly something that can result as a

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,760
benefit of learning in public

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,360
i also want to stress that i think

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,840
learning in public is kind of like a

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,879
hike

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,840
not a sprint and so how do you start

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,680
learning the public

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,440
well i think kind of like a hike you

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,599
just start small

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,720
right you just kind of start out on this

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,239
adventure

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,280
and the other thing you need to think

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,120
about is if you start learning in public

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
don't worry about likes don't worry

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,599
about how many shares you get how many

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,080
retweets

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,480
how many tacos how many emojis how many

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,239
hearts how many gizmos whatever

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,519
just do it for you you know get out

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,040
there put yourself

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,200
you know kind of put your knowledge out

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,560
there and share it with the world

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,760
and do it for your future self

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,519
and maybe the future passed you

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,360
so at this point maybe you're wondering

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,640
all right this sounds kind of neat like

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,519
learning in public i like it this is a

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,280
neat concept

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,640
so rather than taking what i learn and

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,480
just kind of

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,080
keeping it to myself if i learn

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,360
something i can share that

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,400
out with kind of everybody else and so

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,480
you could do things like

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,239
write blog posts it's a great way to do

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,959
it there's a lot of great

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,720
you know tools out there dev.2 is a

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,200
great resource for that

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,560
11t is a great kind of static site

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,080
generator that you can

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,560
that you can use for creating a blog

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,840
post you can also go out there and

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,799
contribute to open source

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,519
uh you know code so uh you know kind of

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,560
help

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,680
pick up an issue or submit a pr the

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,280
other thing that you can do is you can

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,920
also pick up what somebody else leaves

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,599
down

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,120
so a lot of times maybe there's a

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,080
project out there that's kind of

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,000
abandoned

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,599
or maybe somebody starts something with

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,239
a great idea and you're like oh that's

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,480
really cool

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,000
but it doesn't really take off so you

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,359
can go out and just kind of

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,359
pick something up that somebody else

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,040
kind of started or put down

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,240
and pick it up and run with it and

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,360
that's another great way to learn in

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,880
public

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,720
i also created a website called

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,160
lookout.dev that makes it easy to learn

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,479
in public so what you can do

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,479
is you go on lookout.dev sign up for an

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,000
account and then you can create

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,840
what's called a lookout and share what

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,759
you learn and so you just give it a

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,880
quick description you can add some

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,280
things to avoid

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,960
do consider and why and then you can add

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,520
some code snippets of things maybe to

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,400
avoid

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,520
and maybe some things that you should do

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,520
and with that thank you

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,280
i appreciate your time it's been a great

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:57,840
conference so far and enjoy the rest of

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,840
your conference

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,600
