for you guys to host your angular

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,920
applications on firebase

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,760
it's free and it's super easy i can fit

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,039
it into a five-minute lightning talk

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,440
i want you to think of this as a

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,239
lightning workshop all right here we go

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,520
you better follow along because uh you

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,199
can do this

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,199
firebase offers a lot of tools to help

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,879
you online and it

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,040
help your online endeavors become a

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,400
success how all these things can work

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,080
together is beyond the scope of this

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,040
talk but i want you to know

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,960
that they exist first of all for this

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
presentation i will be focusing solely

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,360
on the benefits of firebase hosting

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,119
and how to use it these five things

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,920
describe their hosting offering

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,920
in a nutshell

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,600
here are some of the advantages that

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,000
firebase hosting might have over

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,439
other services that do hosting the two i

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
want to highlight are regarding how

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,240
firebase and angular are both made by

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,159
google

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,000
though their teams are separate we've

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,119
already heard during this conference

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,439
that they

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,960
they do at times collaborate one of the

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,439
results of that collaboration

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,119
is called angularfire an angularfirst

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,360
firebase sdk

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,720
as you know that if you have an angular

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,200
application on

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,960
on firebase google has already tested

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,680
their changes on both angular and

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,840
firebase

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,880
before releasing either of them into the

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
wild

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,079
this results in a combination of sibling

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,079
technologies

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,319
that simply meld perfectly together

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,280
a note on pricing is that for firebase

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,879
hosting beyond the free level of usage

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,959
uh firebase hosting is free until you

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,400
surpass their limit charges okay

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:22,400
um it makes it perfect for prototypes

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,080
portfolios samples any applications

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,760
that you want to start out small and

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,080
scale over time

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,040
note that the free levels are are are

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,519
factored into

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,720
their paid levels so you have to even if

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,319
you're on the paid plan

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,840
you won't pay a dime until you've

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,680
actually increased above the thresholds

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,680
one last note about pricing by

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,680
architecting your applications better

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,120
you will substantially reduce the cost

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,879
of running

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,360
this is true of course of any

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,680
applications but using the live

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,480
usage visualization charts firebase

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,080
gives you

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,599
you can see immediately the results that

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,080
your efforts are having

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,080
on that

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,959
in this diagram i've outlined the four

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,280
easy steps feel free to follow along

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:09,200
with these steps as i go

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,400
um yeah so the first step is to set up

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,560
your firebase project

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,959
so come with me to

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,200
console.firebase.google.com

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,319
or just firebase.google.com and click on

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,040
the get started

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,920
sign up sign in and then click on the

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,760
button that says

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,280
create a project in fact i have a

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,799
screenshot of that right here create a

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:33,840
project

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,840
so i'm going to create a project

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,920
and i'm going to turn that off so it

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,480
goes a little faster um

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,360
and while that's going i'm going to

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,799
continue

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,400
with the presentation because i don't

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,480
have that much time

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,000
uh the next step is going to be entering

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,120
a name for your project

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,319
then you get started by um choosing one

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,840
of these buttons so

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,599
on the next screen after this one

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,200
finishes i'm finished

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,959
so let's take a look okay lightning

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,120
tachyo

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,120
you can add applications we're gonna

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,680
click add web

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,680
lightning

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,200
i want to also add firebase hosting

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,639
register my app

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,479
and when that's done

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,320
it has this stuff which is not going to

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,199
be needed for the hosting part

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,000
that's for the sdk um and we're going to

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,759
need to run this

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,120
i've already done that so i'm going to

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,360
move on

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,639
okay these are the last two steps of of

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,080
this entire thing

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,919
first npm install firebase tools

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,600
then you're going to run firebase login

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,479
okay

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,040
um you're going to do this in the

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,199
terminal

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,240
so we're going to go over here i'm going

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,280
to do firebase

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,560
login and it's going to say oh hey

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,120
you're already logged in

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,919
sweet oh now everybody knows my emails

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,759
okay

00:04:51,919 --> 00:05:00,000
so now we're going to run firebase init

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,000
so firebase init

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,680
and it's like oh hey you already did

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
this are you sure you want to do it

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,960
again

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,160
let's do it we're going to pick funk uh

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,560
not functions hosting

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,479
all of these are super great tools enter

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,440
space to pick the one and then enter to

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,560
do it

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,320
all right do you what do you want to

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,039
make your public directory well it's

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,320
going to be dist

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,320
slash uh

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:27,600
dist slash app slash

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,240
lightning something um i've already done

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,840
that here

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,800
and what that's going to do for you so

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,440
i'm going to go ahead and break out of

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,199
that

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,479
it's going to create these two files

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,919
firebase json

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,720
firebase rc and that's going to allow

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,639
you

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,680
to it generates this for you so you

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,800
don't have to do the hard work of

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,400
setting up the config

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,320
but you might have to edit these things

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,080
later as you expand your app or maybe

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,840
add more apps to it

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,840
so now i'm going to do firebase deploy

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,520
i'm also cutting out some stuff from

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,240
this talk because it is slightly too

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,000
long

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,479
eric we don't see your console your

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,800
terminal oh you don't

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,800
oh that's terrible okay well i'm already

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,720
over time but what i wrote was firebase

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,919
deploy

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,400
and then it did it so now i'm going to

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,400
go to

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,160
my console which i you're not going to

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,160
see that either are you

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,560
well it's deployed that's how easy it

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,880
was

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,240
to deploy your app so can you guys see

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,440
this

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,319
the the firebase hosting yeah yeah

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,880
you're probably sharing an app not a

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,919
screen

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,479
so yeah okay

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,840
so anyway in my firebase hosting account

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,680
you can now go to it

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,240
it is there um i'm going to move on

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,280
so next steps you can add all of the

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,080
other things that come with that

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,599
ecosystem

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,280
right away one of the things that i

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,639
wanted to mention to you guys

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,840
um from talking to people talking to the

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,080
companies who have set up who are

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,479
sponsors uh

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,240
one of them is oasis digital and kyle

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,880
over there told me that they use angular

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,039
and

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,039
scully with firebase hosting firebase

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,759
functions and a lot of other firebase

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,599
tools

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,880
to build that website where you go and

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,759
you get that secret word for the

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,720
conference

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,319
so they're using it for their enterprise

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,800
purposes as well

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,160
um also i wanted to touch on you can

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,080
have multiple sites

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,599
under the same project in firebase and

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,000
it's still free you know

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,639

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,319
had one

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,199

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,479

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,319
