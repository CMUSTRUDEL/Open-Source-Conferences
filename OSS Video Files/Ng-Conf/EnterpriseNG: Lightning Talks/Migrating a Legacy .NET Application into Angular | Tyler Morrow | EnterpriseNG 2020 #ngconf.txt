00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,080
i'm just like going to talk a little bit

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,359
about

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,160
um how we have modernized our legacy

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,680
application

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,439
um at co-star real estate manager

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,240
and we're we're in the process of doing

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,720
this so it's we went from dot net

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,079
to angular which as you can imagine was

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,040
not the easiest thing in the world

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,079
um and is not the easiest thing in the

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,200
world

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,399
but um we did it in much the same way

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,840
we've been talking about today with

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,600
microphones so

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,840
it won't be that unfamiliar to you at

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,160
all um

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,239
so i just want to start out the segment

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,079
by saying that design is not just what

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,360
it looks like and feels like design is

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,399
how it works

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,680
so at the center of my personal um

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,840
i guess mo uh is that you know design

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,840
comes first i used to be a ux designer

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,880
so before i was a developer

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,920
that was my focus um so i always take

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,040
into account

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,159
you know that the design is the

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,080
is where we get our ideas and if

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,479
it doesn't come from there then you know

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,840
you're starting from the wrong spot

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,320
so from there um we

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,920
decided to develop a design system just

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,640
like we have been speaking about with

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,680
micro

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,439
components today um and

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,360
our design system led to a component

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,720
library which i developed in angular

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,880
10 and distribute using

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,240
azure um we we're gonna go with npm but

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,399
since we use

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,320
uh since we use um uh visual studio

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,600
like just the regular visual studio it's

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,119
a lot easier to use azure

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,799
to distribute our packages so um

00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:00,960
that's what we're using for that um

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,360
and then we use storybook for um

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,640
for you know uh showing our

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,840
documentation

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,239
the sort of uh

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,599
i guess delivering the components to the

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,440
developers

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,400
and allowing them to see what the inputs

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,959
are copy the source code

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,640
and use the actual components in their

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,000
code base because

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,000
that's the hardest part is getting

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,760
buy-in from your team right

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,280
so um no design library no

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,959
design system is going to succeed

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,319
without the proper documentation

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,480
so we've found that storybook is a good

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,360
source for that and so far it's been

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,360
working pretty well

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,840
it's in its infancy obviously we just

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,760
started this redesign so

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,519
you know we have a lot of learning to do

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,239
um but

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,120
this is the route we're going on so far

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,239
so

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,800
um i guess the next step in that

00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:00,159
is like we we do do a micro component

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,560
or a micro front end sorry um approach

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,159
so for the most part we do the domain

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,879
driven design approach

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,640
we'll do a page at a time and that page

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,720
will be completely built in angular

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,640
and then we'll build it into the element

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,840
and put it onto the page

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,840
um that was until recently

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,599
we decided that and i'll give you an

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,640
example hold on

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,680
so this is like a page that we put in to

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,840
the application

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,440
it's an angular microphone end we've

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,159
just stuck it in

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,599
um it's just one page that's like a

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,879
domain driven

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,159
so that worked out well it's just that

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,400
that doesn't always work

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,239
so the second approach that we have

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,080
found to be useful would be

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,680
the incremental redesign with micro

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,879
front and components so

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,760
i like to call the micro components um

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,280
but so you have like an aspx page we're

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,519
still using that backend with

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,200
dot net because we haven't moved to

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,080
azure cloud yet

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,799
probably will in the future um but right

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,319
now we're just

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,760
focusing on the ui so this is sort of

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,080
the approach that we're taking is we're

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,599
going to

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,959
incrementally um update our ui

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,640
it may not be the prettiest thing in the

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,000
world it may be in like a mixed state

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,200
for a while but

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,079
you know it'll work for us and so how we

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,359
do that is i take my library repo

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:25,600
i will build out um an

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,919
application project within the repo

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,360
so it'll be separate from the library

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,720
i'll import

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,400
one of the components into that

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,520
application

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,600
and then i'll build that micro component

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,800
or microphone and with just that one

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,560
component

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,840
and then you know of course to build out

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,320
my webca

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,040
webpack config like they were explaining

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,400
in i think

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,680
a couple talks ago um with the

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,120
externals being replaced with the

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,560
webpack

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,600
extra webpack config so um

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,280
i don't know if you caught that in the

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,880
last talk or not but if you need more

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,720
details about that you can always hit me

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,479
up on linkedin

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
my contact information is down here by

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,360
the way so if you ever need to get in

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,080
contact with me

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,039
then that is a good way to do it we are

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,120
hiring front-end

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,479
angular engineers as well so that's also

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,320
something you know

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,639
um but we are in the very

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,479
beginnings of this redesign and this is

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,000
sort of the approach we're taking so

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,960
if anyone has advice or ideas

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,080
we're always open to hear more um here's

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,080
an example of

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,639
our incremental redesign each of these

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,039
is a different micro component

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,000
this one as well and then the aspx

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,280
header up here

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,120
so um yep

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,919
so that's the moral of the story just a

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,320
little recap creative design system

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,759
make it a common language develop a

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,800
component library with proper

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,320
documentation

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,840
unique identifier inputs meaning ids

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,039
so that you don't have you know

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,960
confusion about which component is which

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,319
and then make sure your distribution

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,520
strategy works with your

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,520
uh your sec your work set

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,880
um decide when and where it's

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,840
appropriate to follow the

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,919
domain the domain driven architecture

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,360
versus where it's safer to incrementally

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,880
modernize

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,199
so that's sort of the approach we're

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,600
taking and it's working all so far

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,639
um if you know you're interested in

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:34,960
