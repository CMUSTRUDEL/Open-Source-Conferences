00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,320
all right so i'll just quickly talk

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,000
about um

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,439
understanding media queries so i did not

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,359
prepare a talk for today but

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,920
um this is um uh available on the ngconf

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,119
um medium publication so you can go find

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,679
us at any time book

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,640
bookmark this if you want to um refer

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,800
back to this

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,200
media queries can be a real pain because

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,480
um right there's a

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,239
if you don't understand what they're

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,559
doing and how those rules work together

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,239
um and right if you get them out of

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,680
order you can end up with not getting

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,079
the results that you want

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,200
so the point of media queries is really

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,960
for us

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,640
most of us are probably doing mobile

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,520
first development which means that we

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,280
want

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,199
the root styling in our css or sas files

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,120
we want that to be the styling for the

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,359
mobile presentation of something

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,120
we don't want to style for desktop and

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,840
then have to like do a bunch of changes

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,080
to get it

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,000
down to mobile the reality is is that

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,320
mobile often scales very well

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,080
to desktop and we just need minor tweaks

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,000
to make it look better in desktop maybe

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,840
we can unstack some things

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,240
and better leverage some horizontal real

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,960
estate so we want to use media queries

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,400
to do this

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,320
and i'll just make this bigger so that

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,840
everybody can see better

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,560
um so media query starts with the at

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,360
media uh

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,320
this is the media query css query

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,479
directive

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,840
uh and we usually are targeting screen

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,159
there's also things like uh

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,600
print uh for print layouts and things

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,560
like that but most of us are targeting

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,200
screen most of the

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,520
most the time probably 99 of the time oh

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,520
sorry

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,920
um so we're writing media screen

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,520
and then we're going to combine that

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,200
query so we're targeting

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,960
a screen layout and we're going to

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,240
target that query with

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,399
uh some qualifier that says

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,680
what area we want to qualify so for

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,200
mobile first

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,439
we're not qualifying it with anything

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,960
there is no media query at all for our

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,879
mobile first stuff so the first stuff

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,280
that shows up in our

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,440
sas or css file isn't going to have any

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,760
media query wrapped around it

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,400
so then when we go well you know when i

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,720
get to a slightly larger presentation

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,680
i need to um uh i i need to maybe

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,879
change a flex uh direction right from

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,160
column to row

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,319
so that it's going to use more

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,480
horizontal real estate so

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,040
what i need to do is tell it at what

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,000
break points i need to do that

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,920
so as we're doing that we're probably

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,280
going to be using if you're using sas

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,599
you're going to be using min width and

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,280
max width if you are using css you're

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,400
probably going to use

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
min device width and max device width

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,040
so it'll be slightly different depending

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,959
on whether you're using this sas

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,720
compiler or not

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,040
but the the rules the principles still

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,800
pro apply and i've put together a nice

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,879
cheat sheet on this page

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
that kind of describes okay here are

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,440
some break points

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,040
you may use entirely different break

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,640
points right they may be break points

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,159
that you choose for your organization

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,920
for the devices that are most common for

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,760
your users or whatever

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,680
so right you might have different values

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,879
for what is a small device that is

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,519
minimum width

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,360
and a small device's max width so by

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,800
using these values we're basically

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,200
defining

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,159
the size of a device so i'm saying if

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,840
i'm tar

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,000
and the difference between min and max

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,440
is the way i write my query which one of

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,599
these variables should i use

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,360
if i'm going to if i'm going to write my

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,040
media query

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,640
to use min width then i'm going to use a

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,640
min width variable

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,799
because i want to say i i want to find

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,159
something that has a minimum width of my

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,640
minimum width sas variable

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,239
or i'm going to target it using max

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,360
width and i'm going to use a max width

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,519
variable and say

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,599
i want to target something that has a

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,720
maximum width of my

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,599
small max device i can use them

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,599
combined with and so i can use boolean

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,480
operators to combine these together

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,080
so in this particular cases if you just

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,159
leave one off

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,000
if you are only using for example min

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,599
width then um

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,040
you're going to get everything that's

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,919
above

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,000
this size so everything so if i go small

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,320
sm min width

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,400
min width equals sm min width then i'm

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,639
going to target everything

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,639
that is at least that minimum width and

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,040
higher

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,320
um if i combine it with and then i can

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,720
actually scale it down i can say

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,919
only devices that are say you know

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,800
between

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,520
the maximum size of a small device and

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,120
the

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,520
the maximum the minimum size of a small

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,759
device and the maximum size of a tablet

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,520
so i could get really specific and and

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,280
hone these down so you can kind of use

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,880
the chart to say well if i combine these

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,639
two rules i can target

00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:00,800
just this one type of device maybe

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,120
it's a phone in landscape origin

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,880
in landscape orientation so i can

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
combine them together using those and

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,600
this cheap sheet kind of helps you

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,880
figure out how you can leverage those

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,120
variables and build a

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,120
media query that will target exactly the

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,880
devices that you want

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
it's important to remember about media

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,880
queries that they are applied in the

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,600
order in which they are defined

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,800
in your file so it works from top to

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,160
bottom

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,280
so you start with uh you start with

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,080
mobile

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,840
and then you may only need to change

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,520
your presentation for desktop so you put

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,120
in a media query for desktop

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,120
and then six months later you come back

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,560
to that file and you may need to

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,039
put in a rule for a tablet we want to do

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,960
slight

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,080
something slightly different for tablet

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,600
if you put that at the

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,120
bottom um that and you don't target it

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,720
really specifically

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,960
you could actually end up overwriting

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,240
your desktop rule because it came later

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,759
in the file so you need to make sure

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,720
that you put them in the order that you

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,919
want them to get

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,240
applied it's not necessarily from mobile

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,680
to tablet to desktop

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,280
it might actually be in different orders

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,639
for different reasons it's about your

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,960
business rules and what you want to

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,639
present and how you want those to

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,520
um override one another so think about

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,080
what's in your media query as

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,039
overwriting the previous sets of styling

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,680
that has been applied so far

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,840
so this is just a primer uh right it's

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,680
just kind of an introduction to

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,240
um how to write some simple media

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,319
queries to target different resolutions

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,919
uh there's obviously a lot more info in

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,840
here and i've got a pretty nice demo in

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,919
here that is raw html

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,039
you can just copy the html out of here

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,280
and and and

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,080
fire it up in visual studio visual co

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,680
code

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,280
um go search well actually you can just

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,560
paste it into a text document

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,560
into an and change the extension to html

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,240
and pull it up in your browser and you

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,440
can actually change the resolutions on

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,440
your browser

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,199
and see how things change and there's

00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,840
lots of comments in here to kind of help

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,440
you

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,360
sort through what's going on and why

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,880
those things happen so it's kind of a

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,160
mini tutorial on

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,759
how to leverage media queries and kind

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,360
of get a good start at doing

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,120
good mobile first development using

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,840
media queries

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,840
so those media queries

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,360
