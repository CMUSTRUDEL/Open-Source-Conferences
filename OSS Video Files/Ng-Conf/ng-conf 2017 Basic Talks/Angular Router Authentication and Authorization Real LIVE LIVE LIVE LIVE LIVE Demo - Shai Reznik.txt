nice thank you very much you just refer

00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,059
all code okay now that we're all warmed

00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,879
up

00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:48,070
let's start this dot okay angular author

00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:51,879
authentication authorization we live

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:54,100
live live live demo you'll see why in a

00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,010

res otayo we kill we do funny web

00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:07,630
development courses and we have like a

00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:09,490
three course to anyone who want to start

00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,940
with unit testing which is the most

00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,899
boring subject ever we made it super

00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,810
funny okay

00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:23,069
yes that's jet pro okay for starters I

00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:26,799
need seven volunteers okay I need a man

00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:32,140

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:24,099
give them a couple claws

00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:28,239
okay take this okay and another

00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:31,780
volunteer just juice gone to this day to

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:36,010
give giver I'm gonna close okay please

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:38,950
go there okay also so I like to

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,170
challenge myself and today I think I

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:45,130
will do the hardest actor I've ever done

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:48,400
in my life but before that let's talk

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:54,150
about boring stuff so our goal for today

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:57,190
is learn to secure our component tamer

00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,280
we have no time for a deep dive due to

00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:03,040
the API and all that stuff and it's more

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,340
about the process okay because when I

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,160
learned this process I was like Anna in

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,989
shock and it took me a while so I try to

00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,160
figure out a way to make it more

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:18,910
accessible and ever close to the code

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:21,880
get out there and all the the code

00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:24,400
behind what we can see is on github and

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:27,459
I will share the links in the left side

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,310
okay so what are we by securing our

00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:33,340
components it's controlling the XS okay

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:36,280
it's basically controlling who can see

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:40,120
which components and what is evil she do

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:44,079
Kenya's time site is not secure okay so

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:47,230
don't don't think it is if someone

00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:49,000
really wants to can unhide everything in

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,670
your client-side applications okay so

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,970
secure through your server server site

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:57,760
before we start we need to know the

00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:02,579
terms of access the access control terms

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:07,530
so syndication who knows what is

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:07,530
authentication star Kelly

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,160
now the answer was indication

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,530
yeah yeah you observe something cooking

00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,150
okay so yeah he said verifying identity

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,120
right okay

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,430
so uh and who knows what is

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,719
authorization

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:39,769
[Applause]

00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:45,419
ah you're the core team who knows so no

00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:48,959
yeah what's useless so who is allowed to

00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:51,269
see and do what okay these are the terms

00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,099
so just a small example we have

00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:55,319
anonymous user you want to see our

00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:57,419
components and angle are we have the

00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,389
router in between which controls the

00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:03,929
flow we want to check is this anonymous

00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:06,300
user is allowed to view the component

00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:09,360
but in order to do that we need to know

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:13,949
who is this person right we need to know

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:17,729
his identity and his user ID so this is

00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:19,800
the slope and the first part is the

00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:22,499
authentication second one is the

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,219
authorization once our user go through

00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:29,479
them from anonymous user he becomes and

00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:34,499
identified and user and then a third

00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:39,380
fourth third time right no sleep tonight

00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:42,230
okay so what he said

00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,930
and then he can see our component okay

00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:48,890
so stuck in the middle are cold

00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:52,190
guards okay and we use angular guard to

00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:54,380
apply the logic the decides if the

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:58,430
anonymous user or the user should see

00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,140
our component just briefly about guards

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,390
we're not getting into it you will see

00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,990
it in the get up so we have like five

00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:08,660
and only the 3d three can activate and

00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:12,110
top our for security the other one are

00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:16,040
not relevant and then we have the entire

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,790
process behind a hole of death and it

00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,250
goes like this

00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,140
we have the user and the router and gets

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,560
to the authenticated end you know the

00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,560
joke already

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:31,820
yes this is body my co-founder at iris

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:37,820
okay you're right wanted to complicate

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:42,560
it so I have a plan B okay I wrote a

00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:46,460
stage play script okay

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:50,600
and for that time is the volunteer so

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,650
Intel it's called the princess guards

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,410
okay

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,790
and it's basically a love story about

00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:58,280
the prince and the princess

00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:01,430
so start let's call our first three

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,600
actors to the stage vector number one

00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,600
two and three

00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:09,520
but remember

00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,830
okay

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:22,750

and it will have a cue and it goes like

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:42,020

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:28,480
first in okay I will go to my director

00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:34,480
chair and I will read the script awesome

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:36,880
scene number one we have six okay once

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,830
upon a time there was a prince which was

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,420
in love with the princess but he only

00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,570
had her address

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:48,430
because of show the truck come on come

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:50,500
on come on with him okay before he could

00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,360
get to the camp a princess castle he

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,730
needed to stop at the gate of the

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,270
kingdom and indicates to the mighty

00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,310
