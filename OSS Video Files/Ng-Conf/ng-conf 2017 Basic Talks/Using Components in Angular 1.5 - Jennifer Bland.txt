thanks Ida and so he said I'm going to

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,069
be talking about components in angular 1

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,710
5 I'm going to show you the component

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,679
method that is built into angular 1 5

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:17,340
and that will allow you to make them a

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,950
migration up to angular 2 easier once

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,440
you understand how to use it before I

00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,780
get started I'd like to give you some

00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,700
information about myself it's a little

00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,130
bit of a trivia thing so some audience

00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:33,360
participation is required I'm gonna give

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,880
you four facts actually four items three

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,550
of them about me are true one of them is

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,740
false so at the end of my presentation I

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,560
expect you to guess which one is false

00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:46,710
so to give you more information about

00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,690
myself number one I have been to 82

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,800
countries and I have climbed the highest

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:55,560
mountain on four of the seven continents

00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:59,040
number two I graduated from University

00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,920
before IBM introduced the IBM PC and I

00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,550
earned my MBA before the world wide web

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,920
was introduced number three I'm blind

00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:12,000
colorblind actually so all of you guys

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,909
look black and white to me number four I

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,010
live in a 400 square foot house and I

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,720
actually high-fived Pope John Paul the

00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,090
second when he drove past me in his

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,620
popemobile so it's up to you at the end

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,310
of the presentation to figure out which

00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:29,880
one is not true so my presentation is

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,650
about angular 1/5 my code if you would

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,070
like to follow along I'm gonna give you

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,659
a beautifly dat the beginning and then

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,520
I'm going to actually go through and

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,670
actually do a live demonstration of

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,060
building components in angular 1 v this

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,909
is the where my my code is located

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,159
it's on my github repo so feel free to

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,500
download it it actually has two branches

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,450
the master branch which is what I'm

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,640
going to be working from where I'll have

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,830
everything from the start and then there

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,600
is a perfect branch which is the final

00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,720
version of the application so if you

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,150
want to look at the final version so

00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,929
give you some background about why their

00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:13,819
components in angular 1 5 angular was

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:16,760
released last year in September react

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:19,609
is also rapidly growing a population on

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:25,879
popularity both of those are component

00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:30,430
based architectures angularjs is not but

00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:32,599
with angularjs 1.5 they provided the

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:39,349
components to give you that same

00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:43,069
functionality that was there when you

00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:44,959
use components in angularjs you realize

00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:47,780
that it's nothing more than syntactic

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,480
sugar for a directive anything that you

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:54,169
can do with a directive you can do with

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,150
the component and vice versa but there's

00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:59,419
a lot of things that make them easier to

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,949
use with the component because there's a

00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:02,989
little bit less that you actually have

00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:05,329
to type in to use a component than you

00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:09,019
do with the directive and they also

00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:11,949
default to the industry's best practices

00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:15,049
that have been established in using

00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:17,329
directives and components within angular

00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:19,639
so you're able to take advantage of

00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:23,030
those best practices by using a

00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:26,419
component and then it also by using

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,849
components in your angularjs code it

00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:32,780
makes it a little bit easier to actually

00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:34,400
upgrade to angular 2 so let me see a

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:38,329
show of hands how many of you are using

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,470
angularjs right now okay how many of you

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:46,659
using angular 2 okay how many of you are

00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:50,379
actually using angularjs 1.5 or higher

00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:50,379
okay perfect

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:58,459
when you look at what's in a component

00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:00,349
in angularjs 1.5 you're going to see as

00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:02,689
I said earlier it makes it a little bit

00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:04,639
easier to use than using a directive and

00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:07,579
it allows for the best practices and

00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:11,419
what gives you those best practices is

00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:15,079
that the component is by default it has

00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:17,659
isolate scope it uses a controller

00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,030
instead of linked functions and it

00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:22,820
automatically sets the controller as

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:25,430
syntax so you don't have to set

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,790
controller as like you used to do with a

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,160
directive

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:32,010
and then the bind to controller is set

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,320
by default so you can actually skip that

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,950
option that you used to have to define

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,500
within a directive so to give you a

00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:44,400
comparison between the two here's what

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,290
you used to use when using a directive

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,080
you would come in you would actually

00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:52,410
have to define a function that returns

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,440
an object that object would then have a

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:58,340
scope then you would have your template

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,780
URL or template if you were doing inline

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,580
templates you would have the name of

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,110
your controller or the controller

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,510
function itself right there

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,960
then you would have the controller as

00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,850
syntax and the bind to controller so you

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,470
had to put in quite a bit of information

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:19,970
just to use a basic directive now if you

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:22,500
look at the same thing in a component

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,650
you'll see that there's less information

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,050
that you actually have to type in number

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,630
one you're actually not writing a method

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,120
I mean a function that returns an object

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,970
you actually just give it the object

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,570
itself in the component so you can skip

00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:42,240
that step on there you have the bindings

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,790
that allow you to do the one-way and

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,970
two-way data-binding in the component

00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:50,850
you have the template URL which is there

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,070
like it was previously and then you have

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,340
the controller which was there

00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:58,830
previously but you do not have to come

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,870
in and add the controller as line and

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,450
the bind to controller that you had

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,630
previously so it makes it a little bit

00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:09,240
easier to write your information with

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:13,140
the component than it does with the

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,570
directive some new features that are

00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:19,380
built into components when you're using

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:21,690
them in angularjs 1.5 and higher is it

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,270
provides one-way data-binding

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:26,730
normally what you would have is with the

00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,050
component if you have your parent

00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:31,050
component and you have your child

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,880
component if you pass something into the

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:37,380
child component and then you make a

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,970
change to that value then it would be

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,800
passed back up to the parent because

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:44,819
that you had the two-way date

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,159
finding with angularjs 1.5 you have the

00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,050
option of doing one-way data-binding

00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,940
and what that means this is if you have

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,430
your parent component and you have your

00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:57,180
child component and you pass something

00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:00,210
into the child if you change it there it

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,870
does not come back up and get changed

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:07,620
on the parent now there is one if in

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,840
terms of that thing that it doesn't get

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,930
changed in one-way data-binding

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,069
if you have an object that you're

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:20,699
passing into the child component if you

00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:23,789
make a change to that object then it

00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:26,340
will be passed back up to the parent and

00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:29,729
that's because when you pass in an

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:32,099
object both the parent and the child are

00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:35,009
looking at the same object because it's

00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:37,110
passing it in by reference so you have

00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:39,419
to be aware that if you're using objects

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,580
that is there is a possibility that even

00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:44,280
though you have one-way data-binding set

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,889
that it can be updated in the parent

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,000
itself some other things that it

00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:54,330
provides with angularjs 1.5 components

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,270
is that you have lifecycle hooks this

00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:59,340
gives you the ability of when in the

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,130
lifecycle of the component that you can

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:05,069
actually put in commands and methods

00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:07,409
that will actually run at set times in

00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:10,529
the life of that component

00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:12,300
this isn't thing that was popular in

00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:15,449
angular 2 and they're bringing that

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,979
feature down into angularjs and the

00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:18,930
other thing that you could have is

00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:21,330
actually you can have a stateless

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,969
components when I get through and I

00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,830
start doing the live programming I will

00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:28,080
actually show you an example of a

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,300
stateless component and a stateless

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,919
component is where you have a parent

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,979
component and a child component and you

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,740
you really don't want to put anything

00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,440
like a pass in a state to that child

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:44,250
component you may just want it to splay

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,899
some basic HTML and it doesn't matter

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,880
what people are going to do on it you

00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,010
don't care so you don't need to put it

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,230
back so you can end up with stateless

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,790
components and will actually go through

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:58,240
and do some that are based off

00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:02,860
then some of the lifecycle events that

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,750
you have in 1.5 is on a net which means

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,330
after all the bindings have taken place

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,850
then the on in it would fire so you can

00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,900
actually put in some code there you can

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:16,480
also do a post link on changes if

00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,360
anything happens in the component and

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,420
then you also have the on destroy when

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,820
the component has finished so that gives

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:29,380
you some information about components

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:31,210
and what I'm going to do as part of my

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:35,290
live demonstration is we're actually

00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:37,420
going to create this I work for a

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,760
startup company in Atlanta that's called

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,980
Hurst Otto's how many of you have ever

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,070
heard of car and driver or rodent rack

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:49,240
magazines or have visited car and

00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:53,260
drivers website Hurst autos is the

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,510
company that runs that website so we are

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:59,730
in the process right now within our

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:03,040
company of redoing our website from PHP

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,770
into angular and we're taking advantage

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,200
of all these components functionalities

00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,660
so we actually would go through and

00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,890
we'll actually see how we're actually

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:17,200
building this website that's on there so

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,180
if you look at from a high-level

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,940
standpoint of how all of these

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,920
components are put together normally

00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,280
they're put together by what's called a

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,860
component tree at the very high level we

00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,540
have our app component this is what's

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,410
going to start everything in our

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:38,380
component the app component actually has

00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,870
two child components one is our basic

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,900
navigation and then one is our car

00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:46,600
picker and our car picker if I come back

00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,580
over here our car picker is basically

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,280
this part down at the bottom where it

00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:54,040
has the research vehicles that has the

00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,650
drop-down select for you to choose your

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,480
make your model and then you can click

00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,400
on research and get more information

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,430
about the make and model that you've

00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,190
selected so that's what our car picker

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,970
has and our car picker will have three

00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,310
components underneath it

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,589
it will have that show makes come on

00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,839
select it would have the show models

00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:16,189
select and then it's the button that

00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,709
will actually appear after you've

00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:21,259
selected a make and model and then once

00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:22,100
you click on the button the last thing

00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:25,100
that I'm going to show in my

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,680
demonstration is the car info and the

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,920
car info will actually be nothing more

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,959
than the picture of the car the make and

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,360
model that you've selected and a little

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,129
bit of text about it and then a title

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,970
that tells you exactly what make and

00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:42,889
model that you're currently looking at

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:45,110
when you look at the application that

00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:48,379
we're going to be creating this is going

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:51,050
to be the the folder structure that

00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:53,360
we're going to be using we have in our

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,100
route we have our index dot HTML that's

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,439
going to be displaying our information

00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,600
we're gonna have a folder for our style

00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:02,000
sheets we're going to have a vendor

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,490
folder which I don't expand here and in

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,069
the slide but that basically has just

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,040
our angularjs files I'm gonna be using

00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:12,589
UI select for our select statement so it

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,660
has those things that I'll be using on

00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:16,970
there but the main thing that we'll be

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,730
working with is the components folder

00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:22,550
and in the components folder I have a

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:25,430
folder broken down for every one of the

00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:27,019
components that we are going to build in

00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:31,129
the component tree that I showed you

00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:34,309
earlier and they will all be in that one

00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:36,019
folder now what we're going to do is

00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:39,500
we're going to do a live demo so I'm

00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:43,279
gonna break out of this and again this

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:46,879
is my repo my github account is

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:50,420
github.com rat-race grad which is my

00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:53,809
github account and here is the github

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:56,449
repo that you can see and this is car

00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:58,250
and drivers website and what we're going

00:12:56,449 --> 00:13:01,670
to do is we're going to demo on

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:04,329
duplicate this navigation right here and

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:06,379
then we're going to create a car picker

00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:08,449
that will contain all of this

00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:10,939
information that will have the show

00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:13,459
makes component the show models

00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:15,290
component the show button and then once

00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:18,079
you click on the show button we're gonna

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,680
have a car info component that's

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,600
actually going to show you that it

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:28,649
information about that individual car so

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:31,170
to get started what we have here is a

00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:35,790
basic application and can everybody read

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:38,850
that okay all right good this is

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:41,959
actually how I actually read on my IDE

00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:45,180
every day because I have poor eyesight

00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:48,420
so what we have here is a very beginning

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:51,510
a basic application HTML that has

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:53,970
nothing but HelloWorld in it it has you

00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,339
know all the the angular files that I'm

00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:59,310
loading in it's got my style sheets

00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:01,860
loaded at the top and then it's got my

00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:05,220
app dot J S and if we come over and look

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:08,190
at the app dot J's right now it's just a

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:11,100
very simple angular app that we have

00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,990
available and if we check it out we can

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,420
come over here and we can look at it

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:17,370
pull it up in a browser and we can see

00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,410
that we have this basic application that

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:23,130
we're going to start with that has hello

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:26,279
world on it so to get started what we're

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:29,490
going to start with is our navigation so

00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:32,550
what we have in the components is I have

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,860
a navigation folder and we have a

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:38,610
navigation dot HTML file and a

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:41,610
navigation dot J's file and in order to

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:44,850
create my navigation what I've done is

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:47,100
I've gone out to bootstrap and they have

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,860
some samples if you've ever been to get

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,260
bootstrap comm and this is the sample

00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:55,320
and if you look at the source code on

00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,450
that sample this is the information that

00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,240
they have for the navigation and I'm

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:02,700
taking that navigation information and

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,339
I'm going to take it over here and I'm

00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:09,630
going to come into my navigation that

00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:12,000
HTML and I'm putting it in and simply

00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:14,190
because I'm just usually some shortcuts

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,860
to make it a little bit easier and

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:20,220
faster so as I you know watching me type

00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,500
in all these lines of text that are in

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:26,339
here I've taken the navigation that I

00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,930
borrowed from the get bootstrap and

00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:29,850
there's only a couple of things that

00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,070
I've changed on that information that

00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,910
I've copied over I put in the name of

00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,430
car and

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:38,670
driver so that's the name of our website

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:41,940
and then by default that navigation gave

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:43,980
me three things on the navigation itself

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,220
so what I've done is I've changed those

00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,650
two new cars reviews and news and the

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,960
reason why I've changed them is that

00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:54,630
just corresponds to the first three

00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,760
items that are in our navigation so

00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:03,210
we've put that in we have it available

00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:06,690
to us now what we have is we have to put

00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:08,550
in our component information so this is

00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,740
creating our very first component that

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,170
we're going to be using we go out and

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,540
get access to our angular module which

00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,340
I'm calling car and driver and we're

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,250
going to create a component and I'm

00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:23,610
calling this component navigation and in

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:26,010
that navigation it has the very basic

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,740
minimum amount of information that you

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:31,740
need in order to create a component and

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:34,770
that tells it that it's looking for this

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:37,320
HTML file which is what I just created

00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:40,350
with the navigation that's on there now

00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:43,410
to be able to use that I actually have

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:49,220
to come back into my application and add

00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:49,220
this navigation script file

00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,670
so I'm going to put that in there and

00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,490
then in order for it to show up I

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:06,550
actually have to put it in here in the

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:09,010
body itself so now what I've done is

00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:11,319
I've added the script tag for my

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,030
navigation and then this is where I'm

00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:15,819
going to display it is I'm going to

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:18,189
display it directly into the body of my

00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:20,980
application so if I come back over here

00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:23,050
and I open this up in the browser I now

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,390
have my very first component that we've

00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:28,690
created and it's a simple navigation and

00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:30,940
it corresponds to corn driver and the

00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:34,810
first through menu items that are out

00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:37,240
there on our website so now that we've

00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:39,190
got that in the next thing that we want

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,400
to do is we want to start creating our

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:45,610
car picker component and our car picker

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,590
is going to kind of be the brains behind

00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,540
most of what we're going to be doing

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,700
from here on out because it's going to

00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,650
control all the child components for

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,310
showing the make the model and the

00:17:53,650 --> 00:18:00,310
button itself so I'm going to close out

00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:07,510
of this and if I come over here to my

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:09,430
car picker and I'm going to give it here

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:12,010
is my basic information that I'm going

00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,870
to put in the HTML and when you look at

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,360
what's in here we're going to be adding

00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:19,270
more about it as we go along and this

00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,430
corresponds to on our website nothing

00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:24,310
more than this this basically this

00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:26,950
header and sub header that's on here so

00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:29,500
I've got this information it's got the

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:33,310
information that's on there so now I'm

00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:36,190
going to go out and put my JavaScript in

00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,870
for my component and it follows pretty

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:41,260
much the same outline that we created

00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:43,450
for our nation component I've got a

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,430
little bit more information not only do

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:48,880
I have my template which we just created

00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:51,640
in the HTML but I also now have added a

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:55,420
controller to it and on this controller

00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:57,490
for car picker I'm adding to basically

00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,670
static variables that I have on there

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:02,500
for selected make and selected model and

00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,600
I'm putting that in for right now

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,420
because when you come over here and you

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,910
look when a user selects a make and when

00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:12,520
they select a model that's going to be

00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:14,860
stored in the selected make and the

00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,050
selected model because I will need that

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:23,170
information later on so this is what

00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:25,180
we've got in our basic component itself

00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:30,970
and then we come in and the same thing

00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:36,420
that we did here we're going to add this

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:39,010
in and we're going to add our car picker

00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:42,340
so that that shows up underneath our

00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:44,860
navigation and to see how we're doing if

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,900
we open this up we now have two

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,700
components that we've created one for

00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,580
our navigation and one for our car

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,950
picker so now the next thing that we

00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:56,140
want to go through is after we've got

00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:59,380
this I'm going to actually leave these

00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:01,870
up as now we're going to do our makes so

00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,030
we'll come in and our makes is going to

00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,220
and our component is going to have its

00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:13,780
JavaScript file and it's going to have

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:16,000
its now let me show you something that

00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:19,240
I've put in here for this component for

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,340
makes is it's got its template URL that

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,040
it's going to it's got its controller

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:27,640
now this is your first example of using

00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:30,490
bindings within a component itself and

00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,430
what I'm doing is I'm passing into a a

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,770
binding of make and I'm setting it for

00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:38,050
two-way data-binding and I want it to a

00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:41,790
data binding because when they select a

00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:45,310
make like if they select Ford or Kia or

00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:47,350
Mercedes or some other make I need to

00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:50,010
know that because I need to use that

00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,880
information to display the models

00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:54,850
associated with the make that they've

00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,360
put in there and in my controller

00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,200
I'm just hard-coding right here

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,390
information about all the different

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,610
makes that I'm going to be showing in

00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,710
the drop-down ultimately what you would

00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,900
want to do and a bigger application

00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:10,210
would be pulling this information from a

00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:14,470
database so that you have it available

00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:16,630
to you and I've got just a small handful

00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:19,240
of different makes that I'm going to be

00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:21,820
using for this demonstration and since

00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,340
I'm going to be using UI select to act

00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:26,590
they displayed the makes I've got all

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:30,010
the mix and key value pairs so that they

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:34,800
can show up on there so we've got our

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:39,070
our makes and then we're coming here and

00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:41,610
we put in our HTML code and our HTML

00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:44,680
code is going it's basic simple

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:49,030
bootstrap terminology I'm using a five

00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:52,480
column whipped column and I'm gonna use

00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,970
five widths for my make I'm gonna use

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,760
five from my model and that leaves me

00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,250
two of the twelve that are available for

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,800
my button at the very end and I'm going

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,510
to be using UI select so this is nothing

00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,090
more than the formatting for the UI

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:10,270
select and I'm telling it to basically

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:14,730
go through and have it loop through all

00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:18,460
of the makes that are in my makes in my

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:21,400
controller and display those in my

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,500
drop-down that I have available to us so

00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,930
now that we've got that in we'll have to

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:29,860
come back over here and we're going to

00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:32,500
add the scripts in for the makes now

00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:36,610
instead of putting information about the

00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:42,010
makes directly into the index.html I

00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:46,270
need this to go into the car picker HTML

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:50,830
file so if I come over here and I look

00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:57,970
at my car picker that's in there and

00:22:50,830 --> 00:23:00,400
what I can do is there we've got our

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:03,730
where it's showing our component that

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,860
we've just created in here so what I'm

00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:09,070
passing into it because I've got that

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:12,010
bindings for two-way data-binding for

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:16,140
make I'm telling it that this what I'm

00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:19,240
passing into it is the the selected make

00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,250
variable that we created in our car

00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,840
picker component and it's going to be

00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,060
two-way data-binding so when they select

00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,610
something and it comes back out then I

00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,770
will be able to see that and if

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,840
everything is in here and wired up

00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:34,860
together when we come back over and look

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,590
at it we now are able to see

00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:41,480
from our drop-down every single one of

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:44,549
our mix that we have available to us so

00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,250
gonna close some of these windows out so

00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:50,279
that we have them so now that we've got

00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:52,049
our makes in what I can do is I can come

00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,840
back over here and I can close this

00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:56,850
information out and now the next thing

00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,820
that we want to do is we want to go

00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:03,750
through and do our models and it's going

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:07,740
to be for our models the layout is going

00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:13,139
to be pretty much the same it's going to

00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:21,720
be a UI select that has but that in the

00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:24,090
wrong place it has the same UI select

00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,549
that we have on there and what I'm going

00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:29,190
to use is I'm going to go through and

00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:32,159
I'm going to go through all the models

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:35,789
that are in my controller and based on

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,740
the make that was selected I'm going to

00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:42,090
actually show the models that correspond

00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:45,380
to that so when you come over here the

00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,380
way that that works is

00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:06,530
and my models I've got my component I've

00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:09,320
got the template URL for the HTML that

00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:12,080
we just put in we've got our bindings

00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,940
now in this case I actually have two

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,880
things that I'm going to be binding to

00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:19,250
this component one is the actual make

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:23,330
that's coming in and then the next one

00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:26,539
is the model the make I putting it as

00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:28,850
one-way data-binding I don't care what

00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:31,850
goes on with make that's in here at this

00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:33,650
point I do care about what model they

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:36,620
select because once they select the

00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:38,210
model then that is going to trigger the

00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,820
showing of the button to get the

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:44,270
research about that information and in

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:48,830
my controller I have created just a

00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:54,289
basic object you know that has an array

00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:58,730
of models and each model has its key you

00:25:54,289 --> 00:26:00,620
know for you know for example Buick and

00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,659
then this is the list of models that

00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,909
I've put in there so that gives us some

00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:07,400
information that we can use to test on

00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:10,460
as we go through things so now that

00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:16,280
we've put that in there so we'll add

00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:19,010
this into our API so we add that

00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:23,450
component that's in there and then in

00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:29,409
our car picker HTML we're going to put

00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:32,270
in this information for our model and

00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:34,250
what we're going to do is here's our

00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:37,370
component that we're putting in is we

00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:40,700
have our component for models and then

00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:42,260
what we have is we have our thing that

00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,809
we're passing in because remember on the

00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:48,530
bindings we had two different items that

00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:51,620
we were passing in to the application

00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:54,049
itself so we have the selected make and

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,260
then we have the selected model and I'm

00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:59,900
actually going to hide it until the

00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,940
selected make actually has a value

00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:04,880
that's in it because we remember when we

00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:07,429
created our car picker jas component our

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,520
selected make and selected models by

00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:11,670
default had a value of null and those we

00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,160
filled in as

00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:16,860
user selects things from the drop-down

00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,130
minion so that we've got this

00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:25,940
information we've got everything in and

00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:28,830
then we come over here and we select a

00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,720
make and then from there we're actually

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:33,840
able to see the different models and if

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,820
I wanted to select a different make you

00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,430
know I'm able to see the different make

00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,890
that's available on there so just to

00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,570
recap on what we've done so far we

00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:45,630
started off with the basic navigation

00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:49,020
that was a stateless component all it

00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:51,560
did was just HTML that was on there then

00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,790
from there we created a car picker

00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,290
component that's going to be kind of

00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,510
like the hearts of what we're going to

00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:59,970
have on there and that's going to have

00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:02,490
our selected make and our selected model

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:07,620
that's on there then underneath that we

00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:10,350
created a show makes component and that

00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:12,990
uses two-way data bindings then we

00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:15,300
created a show models and that actually

00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:17,850
had two different bindings that were

00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,340
available to it one item was one-way

00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:22,950
data binding and then the other item had

00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:25,320
two-way data binding on it so that gives

00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,810
you an idea of what we've put in so far

00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:31,830
so the next thing that we want to do is

00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:33,960
actually to go through and let me get

00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:39,930
rid of some of these files and we're

00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:43,110
going to now put in our button in our

00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:46,560
button when we look at it it actually

00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:48,590
doesn't have an HTML file so this shows

00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,360
you that you can actually use inline

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,250
templates so before every other

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,490
component that we've created up to now

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:59,190
had a template URL and the template URL

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:02,310
went to a separate HTML file where we

00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:04,560
had all of our HTML code available to us

00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:07,500
that we could access now what we're

00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:10,620
going to do with this component is we're

00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,480
basically going to do in line HTML and

00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,010
we're going to basically tell it that

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,750
we're going to have a button and the

00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:18,180
button is going to have the word

00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,980
research on it so it's as simple as we

00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:22,590
can get it that we can put it in there

00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,070
so in order to use it we'll come over

00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,070
here

00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:32,919
and add the button for ourself on there

00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:38,880
and then what we'll do is in our car

00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:38,880
picker HTML scroll back over

00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,570
and this is where we actually show the

00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:54,029
button and what we're going to do is

00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:57,389
we're going to hide the button based on

00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:59,639
when you actually select a model that's

00:29:57,389 --> 00:30:03,240
on there and then what we're going to do

00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:06,179
is when you actually click on the button

00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,580
it's going to execute a method that

00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:11,399
we're going to call go to and four go to

00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:15,559
info and we'll go into that and a little

00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:20,120
bit more detail as we go through on the

00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:23,120
information for the button itself so I

00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,120
see

00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,330
now what I've done is I've come in and

00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:39,120
I've taken my car picker and I've added

00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:41,550
some functionality to it the everything

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,200
that was in there before stopped right

00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:45,870
here with the selected make and the

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,080
selected model and I've put in this

00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:51,360
function for go to info and what go to

00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,490
info is going to do is actually use

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,650
routing to go through and actually

00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:57,960
display the details and information

00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,930
about the particular car that we've

00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,270
selected and what we're going to do is

00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:05,310
we're going to get into that function

00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:07,320
we're going to get to variables from

00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:09,720
make and model that are based on what

00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:13,680
the users have selected and then we're

00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:18,000
going to do a state with the UI router

00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:20,490
to go to car details that will actually

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,010
pass into it the make and model that the

00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:25,110
user has selected and what we're trying

00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:27,600
to duplicate when we go through

00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:29,850
something along that lines is if you

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:36,720
come over here and for example you

00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:39,930
select Ford Escape and you click

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,330
research notice if you can see at the

00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:46,020
very top the URL that's being displayed

00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:49,550
here is it's our website Car and Driver

00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:52,590
comm slash the make that you've selected

00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:54,570
slash and then the model so that

00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:57,210
therefore we can pull the information

00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:59,400
that you've selected and then be able to

00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:02,310
display the information that's petite

00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,890
particular to that and make a model that

00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:07,170
you've selected on there so that's what

00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:10,260
we're trying to accomplish and our

00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:12,360
routing so that it makes its generic so

00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:16,800
that it will work with any make in any

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:20,160
model that's available out there so we

00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:23,430
come back over here and I've got

00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:27,090
everything put in I can select a Buick

00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:29,250
an enclave and now I have my button that

00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:33,060
shows up once I've selected both make

00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:37,140
and the model now the last component

00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:41,580
that we're going to put in is our car

00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:43,290
info and our car info is actually what's

00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,120
going to display the picture of the car

00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,559
and the text and

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:52,410
Meishan about the make and model that

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:55,890
you've selected and then when you look

00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:59,220
at the HTML that's in here it's going to

00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:01,200
basically have an image of the car that

00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,990
you've selected and then it's going to

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,300
have some information that's on there so

00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:08,670
at the very top it's going to have the

00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,740
make and model as as a heading

00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:12,090
information and then it's going to have

00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,220
the image and then it's going to have

00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:19,470
the car info and it's going to have the

00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:21,240
image and a six column wide six column

00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:23,940
wide image of the car and then six

00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:27,000
column wide details about the actual

00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:30,150
card that we have available to us so we

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,650
put that in and what we're going to have

00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,920
to do is we're going to have to make

00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,920
that

00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:00,000
so we add the script in that we have for

00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:02,100
our car now in order for the routing to

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,720
work I'm going to have to come back in

00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,670
and I'm going to have to add that

00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,060
routing functionality into my

00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:11,520
application so in my original app I have

00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,980
my config that has this information on

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,470
here and I'm going to actually make a

00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,740
couple of changes to the applications

00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:21,030
right now to allow for the noun

00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,639
navigation to work correctly and

00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:26,609
properly and what I have is I've added

00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:29,129
ui-router in here and I've got two

00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:30,540
routes I have my home route and what

00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:33,600
that's going to do is it's going to

00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:37,020
display a very basic component called

00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:40,080
car picker and then if I select on I

00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,690
click on the button for research it's

00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,760
actually going to go to a URL that's

00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:47,190
going to give you your make and your

00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,710
model similar to what I showed you from

00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:52,260
our current navigation and then it's

00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:55,440
going to actually display the car info

00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:58,859
that's in there so in order for that to

00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,160
work we have a new component that's

00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:05,520
called app and in our app it's basically

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,950
going to have the HTML file and then the

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,380
controller that's on there which right

00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:13,140
now doesn't have any functionality on it

00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,780
and if you look at the HTML file it's

00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:18,420
going to have the header and the body so

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:22,680
that it provides both navigation for us

00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:25,770
and on my index dot HTML I'm actually

00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:35,460
going to come back and I'm going to take

00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:37,590
this out and what we'll see is in here

00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:40,530
I've created a component called Car and

00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:45,750
Driver that's in my app so when I come

00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:49,020
in here I'm actually can just come in

00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:51,330
here and I can put in Car and Driver as

00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:53,820
my component because now it's going to

00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:56,609
display the navigation and the

00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:59,010
information and the content based on

00:35:56,609 --> 00:36:01,320
what which one of the two routes that

00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:03,690
I'm currently on so I've put that

00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,540
information in and I now need to also

00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,470
add in information for the other this

00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:14,460
other new

00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:17,430
on it that I've put in said that it's

00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,010
available to us also and if we come back

00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:23,250
over and we look at this and we have it

00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:26,730
displayed in the in the website we can

00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:29,640
select a make we can select a model we

00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:32,490
can click research and oh crap it

00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,470
doesn't work I hate it when that happens

00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,940
all right what we're going to do is

00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:41,060
we're going to come over here and we're

00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:41,060
going to switch over to one other thing

00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:53,170
all right let's see if we can figure out

00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,170
what I've missed on here

00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:06,410
we've got to put our card information in

00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:10,240
so we've got our car information about

00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:13,310
HDL and we have to put in our cars

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,650
so therefore what it has is it has the

00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:19,280
information so it knows what to actually

00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:24,020
display base and we have in here is our

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:31,430
card cars that Jaya JSON so in here with

00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:33,890
our car info we have our JavaScript that

00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:37,160
has information that's on there and then

00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:39,620
we have our car infra HTML so I talked

00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:43,730
about the HTML file in the beginning and

00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:46,430
then in our car info JavaScript file the

00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:51,710
component itself it's going to actually

00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:55,130
do an HTTP call to this JSON file and

00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:56,930
it's going to pass into it what make and

00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,820
model that you've done and it's going to

00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:02,840
get the information for that particular

00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:07,490
car so in our cars that JSON file it's

00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:09,890
just a plain simple JSON file it has for

00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:12,350
example here's my make here are the

00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:14,480
models that are available for Buick and

00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:17,570
then if I select it for example Buick

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,820
Enclave here is the URL for the image

00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:21,680
and here is the information that's

00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:24,560
actually going to be displayed on the

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:33,920
page for you so now that we've got that

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:36,440
in come back and display and what we've

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,890
got now is we've got the information

00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:43,550
that's displayed for a single car so

00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:45,740
just to recap what we've gone through is

00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:48,290
we've shown you I've shown you different

00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,180
ways of creating components one the

00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:52,190
simplest way of creating as a stateless

00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:54,080
component that we use for our navigation

00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:56,480
I've shown you how to do one-way

00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,820
data-binding within a component how to

00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,980
do to a data binding within a component

00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:03,320
how to have multiple things and a

00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:04,970
binding in a single component and then

00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,120
how to take advantage of that

00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:10,700
information and using routing so that

00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,190
you can have it so that it allows you to

00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:16,400
display information for a particular

00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:19,190
car that's available out there so that

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:23,329
gives you some information on components

00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:25,550
and if I go back to my demo just a quick

00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:28,310
plug for my company Hearst autos we're

00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:30,710
located in Atlanta Georgia we are hiring

00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:33,290
our website as you showed is car and

00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:37,819
driver comm we're currently porting it

00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:40,180
over to angular 2 we're hiring so if you

00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:43,130
are a developer that has some experience

00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:46,730
especially with angular 2 we would love

00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:49,339
to talk to you our website gets over 12

00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:52,069
million unique visitors per month 100

00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:54,230
million pages viewed per month we have a

00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:56,060
lot of followers on Facebook's we have a

00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:58,280
lot of followers on Twitter but not as

00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:01,190
much as the president unfortunately but

00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:04,970
we're looking to overcome that our tech

00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:07,520
stack that we're using is angular 2 node

00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:11,210
and Express on the back end and then we

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,520
use docker for our deployment if you're

00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:17,710
interested here's the information about

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:20,660
myself my website is Jennifer bland comm

00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:23,300
my github account you can go there and

00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,310
get the actual code for the

00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,290
demonstration for today if you're

audience participation required at the

00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:47,750
beginning of my presentation I gave you

00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:49,609
four facts about myself so anybody want

00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:54,490
to take a guess on which one of those

00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:59,810
four items is not true yes I'm sorry

00:40:54,490 --> 00:41:02,060
okay anybody else I did high-five Pope

00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:05,810
John Paul the second on the last Easter

00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:08,060
Sunday that he did before he passed away

00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,230
and I have been to 82 countries and I

00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:13,069
have climbed the highest mountain on

00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:15,859
four continents and I am NOT colorblind

00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:18,589
I can clearly see the you have a red

00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:20,720
shirt on and yours is blue so I

00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:23,030
appreciate you attending my my

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,619
presentation today let me know if you

00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:27,190
have any questions and I'll be glad to

00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:27,190
answer them

00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:44,290
you can by default with components the

00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:47,890
controller as functionality is built-in

00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:50,200
and it uses dollar signs ctrl as the

00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:52,060
value that you're giving it if you want

00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,700
to override it when you go into your

00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,890
component you can actually go in and say

00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,720
controller as and give it a new name I'm

00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:01,510
a new value so if you don't want to use

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,550
dollar sign controller which you saw him

00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:05,680
on my demonstration that's what I was

00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:07,420
using because that's the default yes you

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,600
can definitely override it to anything

00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,600
else

00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:35,530
III didn't understand the first part of

00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:38,800
your question oh I got it sorry I

00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:40,450
couldn't understand I I don't know the

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,300
main difference between the difference

00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:47,260
between the two so I don't know how to

00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:50,710
