Title: Creating your constitution | Chase Gibbons | Lightning Talks 2021#ngconf
Publication date: 2021-05-31
Playlist: ng-conf 2021 Lightning Talks
Description: 
	This talk geared towards defining a process for creating a unique style guide for your organization. But it goes beyond that. Because you need buy-in from everybody in your organization in order for any style guide you create to be effective. Therefore, he speaks about how organizations can essentially be most effective at creating their own style guides through this process of first creating a constitution which outlines the rules for creating, amending, proposing changes, and voting on proposed changes to style guides and other important matters across a growing organization. If everyone agrees on the process by which we create a style guide, and all the historical voting records are kept up to date, you thereby create a way to make what seems impossible possible and you do your organization a huge favor in the process by creating a living style guide that can be iterated on over the years and that anyone can propose changes to at any time. (Depending on your constitution) It's essentially the rules of engagement if you will. All the rest will follow. This model scales across teams as well, just like states have their own constitution underneath the main US constitution. He gives examples of how to get started and how to do historical record-keeping, etc. If everyone agrees to the process by which we make changes to our style guide, if everyone agrees to the voting standards, voting thresholds, etc, (the constitution) and if everything is tracked in a transparent, open manner, and easily accessible for anyone to propose new changes in a controlled mannerâ€”then everyone will be compelled to follow the style guide even if they get out-voted on any particular rule.

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:15,120
so

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,120
i'm chase gibbons i live in logan utah

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,840
i work at rendynamics i've been working

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,800
there for eight years

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,240
now senior software team lead over the

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,960
contact center

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,119
and i'm also a part-time property

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,239
manager on my off time

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:36,000
this here is turbo turbo

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,879
it's my dog um fun fact about him

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,440
he's worked out dynamics now for five

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,640
years

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,559
which is like 35 dogs john papa

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,879
everybody knows john papa he's like the

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,039
king of style guys

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:55,440
um my talk today is on

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,960
my journey in creating a style guide

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,160
essentially

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,120
so from what i've gathered over the

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,960
years if

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,720
john papa tells you to do something you

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,159
probably should do it

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,799
um so and

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,479
the reason we need a style guide largely

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,000
is for consistency

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,320
and maintainability reason

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,080
um it doesn't necessarily mat

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,159
necessarily matter which way you do

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,840
things just so long as everyone's

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,240
consistent across your

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,920
organization um

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,360
so the my first attempt at like

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,400
um doing a style guide just like a small

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,640
experiment

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,640
was we could talk about something and

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,439
stand up and

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,799
everyone would agree on it and but it

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,240
wasn't official

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:52,079
and it wouldn't necessarily be

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,680
abided by also that approach

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,640
um leaves no historical record reporting

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,040
so i had an idea to have everyone vote

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,560
on

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,320
items instead um but

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,240
what ended up happening this first vote

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,560
was uh

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,080
i have more angular experience i have

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,280
react experience

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,319
this one has to do with react um it was

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,239
a split vote

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,239
at first the person with the most

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,760
experience in react actually voted for

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,879
something different

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,800
so this got me thinking that

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,440
the real first step to creating a style

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,599
guide might possibly be

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,959
creating first getting everyone to agree

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,599
on the rules

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,840
of voting like how much each vote is

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,640
worth

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:42,319
and stuff like that

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,599
and so get everyone not to debate like

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,280
the

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,040
ngrx versus no ng rx or arcgis

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,879
versus promises like those can get

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,560
pretty heated but instead

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,480
shift their focus to the lower level

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,560
rules of like

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,440
how much each vote is worth and

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,599
start there um this was our second

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,319
attempt at a vote as you can see

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:12,480
it resulted in a tie so again it was

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:15,920
i was trying to you know get everyone's

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,959
opinions and we didn't have any

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,159
fundamental

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,560
rules governing how this worked and so

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,000
it led to

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,000
more questions than answers

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,879
um so the ideal solution is it has to be

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,920
official

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,480
record keeping castle is a must a new

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,799
rule

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,840
must have authority or buy-in from

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,640
everyone

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,519
should avoid conflict no chance had a

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,159
stalemate

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,200
still me um should avoid ambiguity and

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,560
you guys can

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,480
pretty much read the rest it's just

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,000
should know how to people should be able

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,319
to propose their own changes

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,280
should be able to vote on changes and

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,640
should work either

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,480
across teams or within teams

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,879
so in my experience as a property

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,360
manager my contracts

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,239
are are great for this type of thing

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,519
they're

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,720
self-documenting you can iterate on them

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,079
with amendments

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,120
on they provide an area for of common

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,199
ground for people

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,040
who might otherwise be hostile to each

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,400
other they

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,960
um make things official

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,199
so that's where like the constitution

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,720
idea came up that and

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,440
all everything that was going on in the

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,040
world at the time if everyone agrees to

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,040
the process by which we make changes to

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,800
our style guide and if everyone agrees

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,320
to the voting standards

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,000
and if everything is tracked in a

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,400
transparent open manner

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,080
the idea is everyone should be compelled

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,560
to follow the style guide even if they

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,759
get outvoted on any particular rule

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,520
so i got a quick demo

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,639
i got approximately one minute

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,440
but all right so i i

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,520
threw together uh just quick rough trap

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:10,479
um

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:13,919
style or constitution um

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,039
so first part it's just like uh over a

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,160
summary of

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,360
what's going on the the next part

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,680
name the name is important especially if

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,280
you

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,160
have a up where you have one t

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,320
a team and um that wants their own

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,120
constitution to create their own style

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,320
guide rules

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,280
and then a cross team panel

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,800
of constitution so like a state and a

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,039
federal constitution

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,000
um to where the cross team one is gonna

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,639
overrule

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,120
the individual team one the the name is

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,039
how you

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,039
refer back to it so you define the

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,080
purpose and powers the scope of the

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,800
power

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,440
um so that you're not like going too

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,199
crazy

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,000
this one's just um

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,039
restricted to the defining software

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,199
conventions

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,440
across the company's code base

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,639
membership who's a member

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,000
um who's an active voting member

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,759
the executive branch i did for one

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,800
reason and one reason alone

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,800
which was to

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,600
cast a vote in the event of a tie

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,520
uh legislative branch you can lay out

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,120
exactly

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,880
how the proposals new proposals are

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,199
submitted so

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,639
the idea is get making it very clear how

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,960
anybody can propose

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,720
new changes because so many good ideas

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,919
get lost because they're not channeled

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,039
correctly

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,840
in my experience and so if everyone

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,840
knows how to

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:54,080
channel their their passions correctly

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:57,520
then you can avoid losing um good ideas

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,880
um historical record um

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,599
you can amend this really what this is

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,319
is creating rules so the amendment to

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:09,039
the constitution itself isn't a rule

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,560
the rule is kind of like a law or a bill

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,240
so

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,960
you're creating rules um and then

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,840
you might want to change like who is the

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
vice president

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,720
at some point and that would be an

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,160
amendment to the constitution

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,280
ratification is actually the

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,479
implementation

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,520
so um

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,800
like actually making it official and

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,440
then

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,639
the supreme law of the land for what it

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,800
was designed for

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,800
so that makes it like really official so

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:45,840
everyone knows this is official this

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,840
is what we have to live by

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,160
that's yes so it's evergreen

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,560
um it's constantly updating itself it's

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,960
it once you start it it should

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:06,000
um keep going uh scalable opinionated

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,759
automated fun activity powerful it's

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
just an idea but the beauty of

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,479
it is it harnesses other people's ideas

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:23,919
and allows them to flourish

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:23,919
