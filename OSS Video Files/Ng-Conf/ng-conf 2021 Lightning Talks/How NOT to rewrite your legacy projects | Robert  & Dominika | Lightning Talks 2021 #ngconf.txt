00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,480
so

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,759
legacy code we all know the horror

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,680
behind these words

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,080
and we all want to get rid of this

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,720
burden as soon as possible

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,439
however sometimes things don't go as

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,080
planned

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,320
in our presentation today we would like

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,960
to share with you five lessons that we

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,519
learn

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,320
while rewriting the engineers legacy

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,239
website

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
maybe it will help you avoid our

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,960
mistakes but

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,719
before we will go there let us introduce

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:46,000
ourselves i'm dominica and i'm software

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,760
engineer from krakow in poland

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,840
i'm robert and i'm a developer from

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,320
berlin in germany

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
okay now you know us time to get to know

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,520
our project

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,960
ng girth is an initiative to help women

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,800
from all around the world to learn

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,640
programming in angular

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,680
but the website was written first in

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,080
jekyll quite surprising don't you think

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,159
march last year we decided to fix that

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,119
here our story begins

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,799
and reality doesn't look like plans

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,640
fortunately we had a great team of

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,200
voluntary developers from all around the

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,240
world

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,200
from europe to america to africa in our

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,280
first lesson

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,119
which took us the longest to debug we

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,880
tried to forward old workshop pages

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,000
simply to the new pass

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,720
but the 404 error occurred was now

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
we tried to a lot of different

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,840
approaches debugging

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,119
and the router config or inside the

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,759
scully library

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,720
even trying to bypass with htxs the

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,880
solution was one line of code defining

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,119
our custom rendered plugin right thanks

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,360
to maxim for inspiration

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,600
looking at the scully config our custom

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,479
renderer for flexboxes was specified for

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,240
workshop routes

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,439
but defining it as a default post

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,079
renderer it solved our issue

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,040
time for a second lesson deadlines can

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,360
be your friend

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,399
of course only if you can use them

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,159
smartly

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,079
when we started the project we

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,119
completely forgot about planning

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,360
until we did not set any deadlines when

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,319
a

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,440
initial intuition subsides it turned out

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,319
to be a problem

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,040
thanks to that i learned very important

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,400
thing

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,280
tasks are like water or pets they fill

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,120
all available space it's important to

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,920
prepare your internal deadlines

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,480
and keep them thanks to that you will be

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,519
sure that war connected with the project

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,519
is moving forward

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,280
in our third lesson we noticed that

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,519
everything has a limit

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,280
you cannot use separate domains for

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,080
github organizations on github setting

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,400
pages

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,480
and you cannot use a github organization

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,720
for free on versus for example

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,800
we also reached with our legacy images

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,239
the maximum size of azure aesthetic web

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,560
apps

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,720
in that case we recommend three things

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
first don't move old content and use a

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,760
cn

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,080
second optimize your images to webp

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,760
format for example with the screw

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,920
it saves to 95 of your image size

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,080
third if you use lighthouse which is the

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,159
best friend of angular and scully

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,840
you can reach high performance scores

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,680
like from today here

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,640
seen time for the fourth lesson

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,120
track your work in one place and keep

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,959
one communication channel

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,200
when there are only two people in the

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,200
project communication is really simple

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,720
just a few messages on facebook maybe

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,080
some video conference

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,959
and everyone knows what is going however

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,519
it is worse when as their team grows we

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,840
still

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,640
stick to this simple convention and do

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,519
not agree

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,480
on the one method of communication after

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,720
some time

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,840
we realized that some of us follow our

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,560
task in trello

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,360
others in facebook chat others in github

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,159
issues

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,599
and no one really knows what is done and

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,840
what is to do

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,519
some changes were waiting to merge

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,239
definitely too long

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,840
it's why it's so important to define one

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,599
channel of communication

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,920
and one place to track our work

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,439
we are approaching the end of time so

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,720
let's go to the last

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,000
fifth lesson the most important in my

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,759
opinion

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,240
even if we are talking about some

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,639
problems it was a great adventure

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,520
and learning for us fighting with

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,600
problems and

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,720
learning new stuff help us grow as

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
developers

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,800
and let us just have fun from trying

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,040
different ways

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,160
so we strongly encourage you to

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,800
experiment to

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,360
try new things and do something new

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,080
now i guess you want to see the result

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,160
even if we

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,440
still need to fix some last issues even

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,040
by energy conf

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,040
you can find a preview here

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,479
do you see how fast it already loads

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:11,840
so this was our talk and uh

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:11,840
