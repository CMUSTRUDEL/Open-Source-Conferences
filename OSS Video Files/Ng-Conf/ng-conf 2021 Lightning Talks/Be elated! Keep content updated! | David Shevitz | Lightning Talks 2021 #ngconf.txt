[Music]

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,759
let's see if i can do this then shall we

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,200
do it go ahead

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,640
yeah go for it sweet all right

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,359
here we go what could go wrong

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,240
so you want to contribute to angular

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,080
docs

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,840
well that's just fantastic you

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,519
definitely rock

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,080
but wait you find you're not sure what

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,000
to do i've got the answer

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,960
it's called at reviewed you see

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,879
having our content constantly maintained

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,680
is one of the best ways to keep everyone

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,719
sane

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,120
after all nothing makes a debt so irate

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,120
than reading a topic that's way out of

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,680
date

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,440
angular you know is always evolving so

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,239
you can address the problems you're

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,160
solving

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,760
and while we work hard to bring these

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,239
new features to mind

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,640
it's easy to leave existing content

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,680
behind

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,680
indeed here's a truth that is truest we

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,640
all love to talk about the things that

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,040
are newest

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,920
to tread a new path be brave without

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,159
fear

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,119
but for others to follow we must keep

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,759
the trail clear

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,960
that means steps must always be taken to

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,200
ensure no topic

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,360
is ever forsaken for the greatest

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,840
accomplishments forever ring hollow

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,560
if for those who come after there's no

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,400
way to follow

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,040
to help with this effort we thought it

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,439
was best to add in a way to mark content

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,640
as

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,280
fresh a tag at reviewed that you can

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,840
append

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,840
to almost any topic right at the end

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,680
anyone can use this tag i dare say just

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,439
add it along with the year month and day

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,759
when you read the topic and find it

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,840
correct but what do you do

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,840
if the contents suspect

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,520
we work hard writing docs but try as we

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,920
might

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,439
there are so many cases where the words

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,680
just aren't right

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,880
should you review a topic and find it

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,720
untrue

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,560
we hope you might file an issue or two

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,959
if you think it's a problem that you can

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,040
address then file a pr

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,680
oh that'd be the best and if your

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,000
changes are truly far-reaching

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,560
then talk to me first and i'll help with

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,560
the teaching

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,120
now you might ask how oft to be sure

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,319
that all contents correct

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,720
not just topics du jour i'm not going to

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,200
lie

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,080
our goals are ambitious all topics

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,160
reviewed twice

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,800
a year be terrific but i am no expert

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,280
i hear some of you call there's so much

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,280
to angular i don't know at all

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
who am i to decide that a topic

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,239
sufficient on a subject on which i may

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,879
not be

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,879
proficient

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,120
to this i can say with great hugh and

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,319
great clatter that you are our

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
users and your opinions matter if you

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,440
read a topic

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,720
and you're on the fence about whether or

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,040
not the subject makes sense

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,239
if you try an example and you fear that

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,040
in fact it is

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,400
not something you'd call good coding

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,400
practices

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,599
if you can't read a topic and get right

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,400
back to your code

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,879
then believe me when i say that i want

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,879
to know

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,640
but if you read something and it sheds a

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,440
light

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,640
on a topic that once kept you up late at

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,159
night

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,879
then an at review tag is a very big plus

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,200
to let others know this is content to

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,200
trust

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,000
excited i am but before you attempt to

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,000
try out this feature

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,720
some content's exempt api and cli topics

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,480
aren't good teachers pets but for now

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,959
they don't have this feature

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,360
not yet to recap this talk that is

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,959
so very susian if you'd like to make

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,640
meaningful

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,920
contributions to angular use at reviewed

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,760
i should think

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,560
and if you'd like to know more please
