00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,400
priyanka is going to be speaking on

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,360
her talk is called speed up tips to go

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,280
on when stuck

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,480
so i think this is a great topic i'm

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,000
really eager to hear what you have to

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,080
say i think everybody

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,400
can relate to this just feeling like you

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,600
know banging their head on the wall so

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,960
i'm really eager to hear what you have

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:31,840
to say but i'll turn it over to you

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,840
thank you um

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,200
there should be a toolbar at the bottom

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,200
where you can share

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,110
so these are really simple uh

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,210
tricks that has helped me

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,210
[Music]

00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,399
so my name is priyanka ingolipagar and

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,079
uh i'm an angular developer so i have

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,079
uh like

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,799
let me just start so you know everything

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,080
is possible if you break it down into

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,840
manageable steps

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,520
so you have to like create a checklist

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,119
of each and every

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,640
um what do you say uh

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,280
thing that you are supposed to do for

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,920
example if you're creating a

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,280
web page and in that you have different

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,720
different sections

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,720
and uh like the navbar the drop-down

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,560
list the images that you need to include

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,720
the functions that you need to call

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,000
so when you list out each and everything

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,439
and when you complete

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,600
uh them you you can like

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,640
uh check it out of your list and it

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,200
gives you a

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,240
feeling that this uh the work is

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,360
completed and it

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,520
helps you keep going on uh instead of uh

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,880
trying to focus on everything at once

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,360
you

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,200
focus on one thing at a time you could

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,079
also use a timer

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,759
so that you do not uh waste much time in

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,479
trying out things for

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,119
a longer period of times so for example

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,239
like you

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,280
might want to um

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,920
you know try out uh different things

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,200
so maybe it's one or two hours uh but

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,200
after that time

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,599
it's better to seek help so that you

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,879
don't waste much of your time

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,640
and you have

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,239
like you can ask your friends or your

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,080
colleagues because everyone knows

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,239
something that you don't and

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,920
even if the person is less experienced

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,560
than you you might

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,640
get an idea or maybe a trigger point on

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,200
how to

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:46,720
go about for your solution you also have

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,519
you can go to the original websites

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,080
which has the documentation they not

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,080
only have

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,000
good document documentation they also

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,519
have

00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,159
the what you say

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,959
examples listed out and this tag blitz

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,280
is

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,000
uh staglet's links to which you can go

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,440
and play around

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,519
with the concept then uh

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,519
one more thing that you can do like they

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,040
say pen is mightier than this word

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,920
uh so you the way you have memory

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,280
the way your brain has memory even your

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,280
body has memory

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,120
so when you actually write it down it

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,360
becomes uh

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,239
like you can absorb the concept more

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,319
clearly

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,519
for example if you are stuck into some

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,840
for loop and

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,319
you're not able to you know

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,879
get why exactly you're facing this issue

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,159
uh you can write down the

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,879
um each and every iteration i know we do

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,640
have

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,480
uh facilities in the editors to

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,720
watch out the variable values and all

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,080
that but when you actually write down

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,879
you know what you're going through uh

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,480
like what exactly is happening inside

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,400
your loop and how exactly the

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,720
iteration is happening and how exactly

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,920
the values are changing

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,319
and the next thing is like

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,000
most of the issues you faced are already

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,799
faced by others and results so you could

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,120
go to the

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,560
social sites like stack overflow and

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,120
github and

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,680
uh most people most probably they'll

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,359
have the

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,479
solution to your uh issues uh you you

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,240
can also raise

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,520
uh tickets if there's no solution

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,639
available

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,280
uh also uh

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,280
our projects are huge so it we tend to

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,840
get overwhelmed by the

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,720
amount of work that needs to get done

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,600
and

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:44,880
uh so if you create um

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,080
small example of uh what the issue

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,800
you're facing

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,800
then it you can really focus on one

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,800
thing at a time and it becomes easier to

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,199
get solution

00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:09,600
uh that's it i i hope you guys

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:09,600
