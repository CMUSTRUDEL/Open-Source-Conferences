published so

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,519
excited to talk about this visual studio

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,360
code extension today

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,800
yeah great okay well i'll just turn it

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,120
right over to you then

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,800
awesome thank you so let me start by

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,879
sharing my screen

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,840
and are you able to see my screen yes

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,160
yeah

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,879
okay all right so today we'll be talking

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,840
about

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,200
angular evergreen angular evergreen

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,079
green is an

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,360
open source visual studio code extension

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,559
that's published on

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,760
the marketplace we have about 24 2500

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,480
active installs

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,320
at the moment which is great and uh we

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,280
have a pretty robust uh set of

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,920
contributors

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,119
myself aristidus bumper cost and other

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,200
angular gd

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,799
uh kenton bulcock brunon hawkins alex

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,640
hoffman and brennan sawyer from the

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,280
angular dc community

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,840
so definitely not not possible to do it

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,080
alone

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,560
so the key features of this extension

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,080
are notification of angular releases

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,439
within your ide

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,320
checking for latest and next releases

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,799
on the fly being able to run ng update

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,960
from the comfort of your ide

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,320
run a post update checkup after you've

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,840
done your upgrades

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,000
and then and auto configuration scripts

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,680
to configure your angular projects for

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,520
vs code

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,280
all right so why an extension first off

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,280
it's very easy to get into there are no

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,200
subscriptions or sign-ups required

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,119
and as developers we need focus to

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,840
develop and we kind of live inside of

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,920
our

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,520
ides so we don't really you know start

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,200
our day and think like

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,799
oh my god you know i wonder if there's a

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
new patch release for angular

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,000
you know we just don't do that so being

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,000
able to uh get that

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,479
uh right there within the id you push to

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,720
us will make us more aware of what's

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,720
what's going on in the angular world

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,239
also your multiple projects can be on

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,680
different releases so

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,360
you might not necessarily have the

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,040
awareness of

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,520
which patch or which minor version a

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,440
particular project is on

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,800
this is also useful for tracking you

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,080
know next releases you know

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,879
right now angular rc 0 is out

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,879
you know did you did you know that so

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,720
being able to aware

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,920
helps you get get prepared for the

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,319
upcoming releases

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,360
and it is really important to be up to

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,760
date on angular

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,480
um so one thing the extension does is

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,040
whenever you

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,640
launch your project they'll tell you if

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,920
you're already evergreen

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,200
or if you're out of date uh so uh

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,040
once you're in the ide you can right

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,120
click on your angular json file and then

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,640
hit check for updates they'll run the ng

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,760
update command for you so you can see

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,239
what uh what you're behind on and now

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,239
for me

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,239
more detailed information you can use

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,519
the sidebar which is the versions

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,720
quick commands and a help section so

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,879
that's a quick demo here

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,959
so here i'm gonna start an existing

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,599
project a local weather app

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,400
which is also featured in my book and

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,800
here

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,800
on the top bottom right corner it's

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,840
about it's going to tell me

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,159
um so yeah so my angular is out of date

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,200
so let's let's find out more about it

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:34,239

and then i'll start running that command

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,319
for me

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,400
