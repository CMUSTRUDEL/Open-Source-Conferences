[Music]

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,440
all right

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,639
well what's up angie khan friends my

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,960
name is kate skye

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,000
and this is my lightning talk the secret

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,560
weapon of becoming an angular superstar

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,560
remember peter gibbons from the 1990s

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,320
movie office space

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,560
the soul crushing boredom that was

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
described in this movie was not at all

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,120
what i experienced at my

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,600
first job as a young mother in my 20s

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,719
what i encountered was was vastly

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,280
different

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,879
i was driven encouraged and fulfilled

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,920
and i made friends at work

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,120
i anticipated going to work too although

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,160
i was the only

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,680
woman on the team just like in the movie

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,840
uh for a while and my forward

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,280
thinking manager was a wise man so he

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,120
fixed the imbalance

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,800
creating one of the best team cultures

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,600
that i've ever been on

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,640
fast forward to y2k and i realized that

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,040
my success on the team was 100

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,479
due to my manager's dedication he was

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,439
bringing his team members

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,439
up guiding them towards excellence

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,000
bringing out the best in the others

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,600
is how he found the best in himself he

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,720
was a true mentor

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,159
unlike this guy in

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,400
in 1962 the name stephanie shirley found

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,240
one of the uk's first software startups

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,280
dedicated to employing women

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,680
software developers working part-time

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,960
from their home which went on to be

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,360
hugely successful

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,200
she blazed the trail for women and the

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,840
entire computing industry

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,880
in 1996 the freelance programmers

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,520
floated to the

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,079
london stock exchange making over 70

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,040
employees of that company millionaires

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,640
today dame stephanie ranks among the

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,560
world's leading philanthropists

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,799
have been giving most of her wealth away

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,960
in support of i.t and autism

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,759
if you haven't seen her ted talk titled

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,840
why do ambitious women have flat heads

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,119
please watch it later what an

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,840
inspiration

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,879
she was a true mentor i'm a mother of

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,800
five children

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,920
and went through some most difficult

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,080
times

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,560
in my life when i had to explain the

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,520
gaps in my resume

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,959
yeah the missing piece was the fact that

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,200
i didn't have a mentor

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,080
i was very indecisive about how much i

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,800
can accomplish

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,319
one day i even quit my job to open my

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,200
own business because i

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,640
i thought i had i hit a glass ceiling

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,800
today i'm a consultant

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,800
software engineer and i have been able

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,720
to build the path for myself

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,640
to have a fulfilling work and a passion

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,560
for mentoring young mothers to become

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,239
software engineers

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,720
i wish more companies promoted

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,879
mentorship and internship

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,040
for women especially for women coming

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,040
back after raising their children

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,800
and providing opportunities for working

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,519
part-time from home

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,280
while taking care of their families now

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,080
when i mentor women coming back to

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,400
workforce

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,760
i encourage them to get empowered by the

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,760
choices they make

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,360
i show them what they feel maybe

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,640
downside to their situation

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,480
is actually is their strength their

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,879
challenges is what makes them who they

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,280
are

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,720
difficult roads lead to beautiful

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,800
destinations

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,720
just encourage everyone to seek out

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,000
mentors i'm always in the pursuit of

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,080
wisdom from people

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,680
that helped me grow as a person and a

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,360
technologist

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,720
i have been lucky to have met some

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,280
incredible people

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,640
who helped me with my confidence to

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,440
reach my goals

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,319
i will always open be open to meet new

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,720
people

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,640
being a mentee is a humbling experience

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,440
no one should take for granted

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,319
this is my secret weapon check out some

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,680
of these

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,080
famous people who who had mentors

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,680
and you can read about them on google

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,920
obviously and not here

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,319
uh so yesterday i was actually mentoring

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,799
at ng girls workshop and this experience

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,720
alone was a proof that giving gifts

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,120
is much more fulfilling than receiving

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,280
them the organizers are true mentors

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,319
because not only they multiply angular

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,920
developers

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,920
but also mentors now when i

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,480
um

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,480
okay

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,160
so now when i mentor women coming back

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,759
to workforce i encourage them to get

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,759
empowered by the choices they make

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:33,040
um i already said that

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,040
what happened to my slide

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,040
uh we live in the world we're faced with

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,680
uh when we're faced with

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,440
