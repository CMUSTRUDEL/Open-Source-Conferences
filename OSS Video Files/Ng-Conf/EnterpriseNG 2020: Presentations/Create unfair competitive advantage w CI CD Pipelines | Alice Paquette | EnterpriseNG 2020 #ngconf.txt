Description: 
	Growing a company is painful. At the enterprise level, the hundreds of processes involved in getting code from a developer to your customers can often look like an incomprehensible tangle of spaghetti, making every new release a series of headaches matching the length and complexity of your delivery pipeline.

Fear not â€” Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) are here to help. In this talk, you will learn what those four innocuous words mean, and how they will both simplify AND turbocharge your pipeline, all the while reinforcing both your teamâ€™s and your customersâ€™ confidence in the product you deliver.

Learn the best ways to build reliable web applications, write quality code, choose scalable architectures, and create effective automated tests at the Reliable Web Summit this August 26-27, 2021. Powered by the team at ng-conf.
