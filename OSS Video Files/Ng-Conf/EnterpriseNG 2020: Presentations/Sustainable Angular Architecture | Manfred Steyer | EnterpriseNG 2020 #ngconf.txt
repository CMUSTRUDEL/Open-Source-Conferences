Description: 
	Monorepos allow huge enterprise applications to be subdivided into small and maintainable libraries. However, this is only one side of the coin: We need first to define criteria for slicing our application into individual parts and establish rules for communication between them.

This session looks at a solution provided by Strategic Domain-Driven Design. Using an Angular-based case study, we investigate the idea of the ubiquitous language and the bounded context, sub-domains, and context mapping. Building on this, you will learn how to implement these ideas for Angular using a monorepo. We also discuss approaches for reducing coupling between the specific parts of our monorepo.

By the end, you will have a technical solution and appropriate methodology to build sustainable Angular solutions.
