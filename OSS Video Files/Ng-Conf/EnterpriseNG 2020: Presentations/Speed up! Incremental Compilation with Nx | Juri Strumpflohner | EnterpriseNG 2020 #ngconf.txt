Description: 
	At Nrwl we work with some of the worldâ€™s biggest companies. By working alongside their teams, we directly experience the problems and pain points they face on a daily basis, especially when it comes to scaling products and code bases across such large enterprises. These lessons directly influence how we build Nx. We understand the importance of proper DX and how much time and money it can save businesses.

Speed is one such important characteristic. The fewer time developers have to wait for their CI pipeline to finish, or their app to recompile, the less they get distracted and hence can be more focused and productive. We recently introduced Nxâ€™s computation caching, which together with Nx Cloud addresses precisely that problem. In this talk, weâ€™re exploring how computation caching enables us to go to the next level: implementing incremental compilation in Nx.
