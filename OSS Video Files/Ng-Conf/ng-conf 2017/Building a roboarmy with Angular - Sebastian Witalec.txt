near me cool so I'm Sebata meet Alice a

00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,950
token of my surname I consider myself a

00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,560
jack of all Angela and a master of

00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,930
robots robots and if you on twitter you

00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:17,470
can follow me on savita so the thing is

00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:19,119
like I live in London UK and in the park

00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,110
there that's like this load of squirrels

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,090
and ducks and they are really cute right

00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,490
but are they between the park where I

00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,930
live the school's like develop this

00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,220
strange behavior and they started

00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:32,259
throwing peanuts of people with

00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,659
allergies some of them started bringing

00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:37,239
bazookas and it's just like all massive

00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:39,460
havoc so it's like okay we have to do

00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:41,109
something about it and the storm

00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,749
troopers came over to the rescue and

00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:46,539
they're trying to subdue the rebellion

00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:50,350
but we all seen Star Wars before and

00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:52,329
that always fails miserably right sounds

00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,100
like a meeting poet like I never give up

00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:57,010
Rises like okay Tom trooper spell

00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:00,489
nothing new let's call somebody else for

00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,949
help so the robot answered the call but

00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:04,750
there was a problem they were speaking a

00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:07,090
very different language to our language

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,090
right like they came say hi and a ski

00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,280
anywhere like whatever so the thing is

00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,890
that all the robot they speak Bluetooth

00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,200
language right and the way blue that

00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,970
actually work is like you divide its

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,560
functionality into a bunch of services

00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,840
so you have like a dashboard service

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,730
weapon service and drive control service

00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,350
and each of those services then is

00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,300
divided into a bunch of characteristics

00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,040
so for dashboard we would have for

00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,320
example a speed indicator and a fuel

00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,390
indicator for weapons we have cute or a

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,760
laser and then poor drive control have

00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,130
steering wheel accelerator and brake so

00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,710
you use those characteristics to either

00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,170
read data or push some instructions

00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:47,260
right so what we're going to look at

00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,570
today is how to do that from web and how

00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,710
to do it from a mobile application ok so

00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,870
let's start from web if you want to

00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,060
build a an angular application where we

00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,190
can use web Brutus which runs really

00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,590
nicely in Chrome so you can run it like

00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,600
in Chrome on on your laptop but as well

00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,760
on your android device or iOS right

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,710
pretty cool and the way you can use it

00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,319
you have to go to like a bunch of steps

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,170
so first like it's quite useful if you

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,430
install web browsers Taipings and then

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:16,219
after that we basically you have

00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,540
a bunch of steps so first thing you have

00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,640
to do is like request the device and

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,260
just provide some parameters so you say

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,209
okay I want to find all the devices

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,189
which name starts with mumbo and you

00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,739
provide the new IDs of the services that

00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:29,180
you're interested in using okay and what

00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:32,030
this will do is actually will pop up

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,069
like a little window in the browser of

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,379
the user as showing like all the devices

00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:38,359
that you can find in the area okay and

00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,159
when they use it accept it that's when

00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:42,290
the prom is returns and we get a device

00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,659
and once we have a device we can connect

00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:47,629
to it then that will give us a service

00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:50,450
server and then using the server we can

00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:52,639
then get all the perfe primary services

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,220
any characteristics from those services

00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,739
and once we have the characteristics we

00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,870
can start talking to the robot okay so

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:02,209
if you want to get a value from a robot

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,760
let's say you want to check each battery

00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:06,859
levels you can just you the battery

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,510
characteristic just read the value and

00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:10,370
then you pass it and that's how you get

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,799
a value out of it if you want to send an

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:14,900
instruction into the robot what you can

00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,650
do is you just construct look at in

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,419
array which construct contains all the

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,129
pieces of information that the robot

00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:25,729
needs and then you just write

00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:27,229
characteristic right value okay so the

00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:28,819
first volunteers arrived as we were

00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:31,549
trying to figure out how to communicate

00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:34,729
with them using the web bluetooth and we

00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:37,729
have like a bunch of those drones and

00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:39,889
the thing is that actually calling those

00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:42,430
services and characteristic is an easy

00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:45,290
job what difficulties actually knowing

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,729
what are the characteristic addresses

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,949
what are the commands that you can send

00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:51,049
in and that's why i created this thing

00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:53,389
called a mambo angular service is an npn

00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:55,669
module you can install and inject it

00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:58,639
into your angular project and this will

00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:00,889
simplify for you to actually use an

00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,840
angular project with a mambo draw okay

00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:06,459
so i'm going to switch off the drum

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,489
switch on the drone come on buddy and

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:14,989
i'll show you a little bit of code so

00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:17,690
let's go to VF code quickly so the way

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:22,219
you use it want to install it I'm in the

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:24,260
right product yep so that's what so the

00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:25,660
mumbo service itself has like a search

00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,040
function

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,320
will perform that there's like I was

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,030
showing you before but I'm just going to

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,100
skip that part and just go straight away

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:40,320
to the way you are you supposed to use

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:42,940
their application wrong place area cool

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,950
so what you have to do is just inject

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,300
the mumble service and then using the

00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,820
month of service you can call search and

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,770
if you think a wait like this wait until

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,230
the drone is ready for you to kick off

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,930
and then using that drone object then

00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:58,660
you can call functions like take off or

00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,700
land or said some other instructions

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,220
into it so if I show you quickly take

00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,930
off we literally using the flight

00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,540
command instruction characteristic and

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:12,310
we passing a value 0 1 0 if you want to

00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:14,890
tell it to land it's like 030 so how

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:18,310
about I show you this in action so I'm

00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:21,190
pressing search see found my drone I can

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:24,190
press pair and that should connect with

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:27,160
drum in a moment there you go we are

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:30,280
ready to fly and if i press like a take

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,630
off button you kind of take off and

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,320
that's what I can control in the

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:37,480
keyboard so I can make him go all around

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:43,150
anyone brave enough to dare to fight the

00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:45,730
drunk go on anyone know so he's pretty

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:50,010
cool and see if I can make him land

00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:52,120
nicely come on come on come on go online

00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:55,500
there you go so that's how you play the

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,500
drum right pretty cool

00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:05,290
so coming back if you want to get one of

00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:07,320
those guys their corporate mumbo the

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,820
like hundred dollars a pretty cool so

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,620
you can use them to scout on your

00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,990
squirrels in the park right send them

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,730
ahead is got cameras with a cannon so

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,850
you can do a lot of stuff and it really

00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,890
cool but what if you want to go beyond

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,360
chrome right if you want to if you don't

00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:24,190
want to use it in chrome like what if

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,310
you want to use it on your android

00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,960
devices an application or on iOS then

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,110
what you can do it you can use native

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,760
script with angular and the reason why

00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,920
as well you would use it like what

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,230
beauty is limited only to like one

00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,180
connection one connected device well if

00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,760
you want to have a whole army of robots

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,920
right you need more than that so Android

00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,290
and iOS actually allows it to connect to

00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,530
about 10 devices which you know it's a

00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,360
bit better to be a it's a bit better to

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,220
actually fight the squirrels so wasn't a

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,380
native script it's basically an open

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,180
source framework that allows you to

00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,870
build mobile applications with angular

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,640
and you get native UI component out of

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,890
to the UI in a performance that you get

00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,770
is actually a Canadian is an Android

00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:10,240
application so there again like few

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,310
different steps of the way Brutus work

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,540
is slightly different so one of the

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,430
first things you have to do you have to

00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,580
install native to bluetooth plugin and

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:21,310
once you have that we have to first ask

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,530
the app user to give us a permission to

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,630
use bluetooth so that's why we use

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:27,640
request cause location permission and

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,919
once we've done that basically we can

00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,720
start using Bluetooth functionality so

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,810
if you run blue to start scanning so

00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,030
that will basically run over a few

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,520
seconds and then we have this callback

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,990
on discovered that will get cold every

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,030
time there's a new device discovered in

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,490
the area and that fall back gives us

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,740
this peripheral object which has a lot

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,960
of attributes inside but the UID and

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,970
name are the important ones so name is

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,230
what you will display to the user so

00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,490
that they can select the one and when

00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,460
you want to connect to the device you

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,810
just use that you ID and so if you want

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,430
to connect the device you just call

00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,440
Bruce of Connect passing the device you

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,330
ID and then we have to call box one

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,450
unconnected one on disconnected so you

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,409
can control the lifecycle of your

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,330
communication with the device

00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:14,300
and then finally if you once you've done

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:16,099
that if you want to let's say again get

00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,289
the battery level from the robot just

00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:20,539
called brutal reach and passing passing

00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:23,119
the device service and characteristic

00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:24,949
UID and then this will give us a promise

00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:26,989
we can parse it and then that's how we

00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:28,999
get the values from the Roman if you

00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:31,999
understand instruction it's almost the

00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:34,039
same except we have to also add the

00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:36,169
value so that's like a comma-separated

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,669
string with hexadecimal values that we

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:39,620
pass in and that's how you send

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,110
instructions and then basically just

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,680
called Bluetooth right without response

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:48,620
and that's pretty much the whole magic

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:52,459
so another robot joined our quest to

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:55,459
find a fight that the evil squirrels as

00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:57,800
my friend is called me push and then

00:08:55,459 --> 00:09:00,470
just like we did with the mumbo drum I'm

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,019
going to put a bit behind I create an

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,120
NPM package so again you can use like a

00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:06,949
bluetooth search and once you connect

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,569
the device you get this new device

00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:10,879
object that allows you to call like a

00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:17,680
move forward turn left or say something

00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:21,050
right so what I'm going to do silence

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,509
seriously what I'm going to do I'm going

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:27,380
to connect to the guy and then show you

00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:32,019
a little bit how it works you to load

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:34,279
the application scan found the robot and

00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:37,730
I'm going to jump into the code in a

00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:43,759
second so connect it so let's first

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:46,370
start with me push say hi saying hitter

00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,949
he's a gentleman right and as well like

00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:51,410
i can use accelerometer to make him like

00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:55,069
go around so i'm not sure to be able to

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:59,059
see it but I can control him we're just

00:09:55,069 --> 00:10:00,589
moving my hand it is pretty cool so like

00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:02,600
if you don't want to get close to the

00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:05,259
screws like he's happy to go on a

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,879
suicide mission for you why not right

00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:10,040
all he needs is like a fresh bag of

00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:16,040
batteries once a week and then

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:18,500
everybody's happy so not yet so

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,480
basically i'll just show you the project

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,670
very quickly if you wanna use it again

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,420
so envious code

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:27,920
it's a very very similar kind of

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,980
construct so we have the Bluetooth

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,750
scanner if you call can function that's

00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,180
basically we'll go find all the devices

00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,100
check and then you check whether their

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,670
meat so only give you the ones that you

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,290
interested and the way you would use it

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:45,920
and like just like I was showing you the

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:47,930
accelerometer before what we basically

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,350
need to do is when we start the

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:53,450
accelerometer every time I change the

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,180
position of my phone I will get

00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,490
different x and y and then I can use the

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,170
X for the turn speed and the wife or the

00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,600
speed fall for the direction and that's

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,820
how I was able to communicate and pretty

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,680
much then I was just running a loop so

00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,810
every 50 milliseconds I was sending your

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,640
command to the robot to tell him where

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:17,060
it's supposed to go and that's pretty

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:19,390
much the whole magic so coming back so

00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,710
the thing is like I mentioned before

00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:24,560
sending the root of command is the easy

00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:26,360
part right what difficulties knowing

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,080
what commands to send what services

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,860
descent and the drone itself he's got

00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:36,410
this little cannon I'll show you so

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,820
we've got like a little cannon and if I

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,410
climb around like I can shoot like

00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,870
little Bullock's right how do you fight

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,940
screws you have to shoot them right so

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,710
but I couldn't find anyone in

00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,320
documentation how to actually use the

00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:50,990
column right so what I did what you can

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,910
do is if you have an Android device you

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,580
can go to Android developer options

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:58,340
enable bluetooth hgih sea ice new blog

00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,680
and then if you use an application that

00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,560
will basically log all the bluetooth

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,390
communication for you right so it's

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,860
pretty cool so once you have this log

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,950
file you can use this tool called

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,960
Wireshark and then you can inspect all

00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,570
the packets that are in the application

00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,760
right so you could go like step by step

00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:19,310
and then see what commands were sent so

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,680
since i already had an original app for

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:24,740
the drone that had this for the firing

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,300
functionality i did this i set up like a

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,930
testing structured so I connected the

00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:32,180
device and I called fire fire then I

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,640
made it a couple and five three times

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,529
take off and land okay and since I

00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,589
already knew the command for takeover

00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:41,120
land which is basically it's kind of

00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:42,889
divided into two parts there's always

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,170
the perfect every time we send a command

00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:47,240
will always be four there's a like an

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,949
incremental number and two and after

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,959
that there's a actual command you

00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:54,949
remember when I was sending the 010 to

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:57,410
take off that does the think so having

00:12:54,949 --> 00:13:01,399
known that already I could do this i

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:03,410
exported my log into Wireshark sorted it

00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,850
all by the characteristic ID so I was

00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,620
only looking for the characteristic that

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:10,279
was sending instructions right sending

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:12,589
the orders and then I was able to find

00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,990
the take of an uncharacteristic and you

00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:17,600
remember I did like to fight three times

00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,249
in between a take over land and there we

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,199
are the three commands that we

00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:23,120
interested and theirs as well two

00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:26,240
identical ones just before take over

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,910
land so hey that's pretty much our fire

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,160
instruction so I could take this and

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,259
that's like a hexadecimal value and I

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,899
could actually turned it into a function

00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:36,829
into in in my service so basically

00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,050
that's how I was able to

00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:41,449
reverse-engineer the original app so

00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:45,589
that we could run it in angular pretty

00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:48,160
cool right so adding a cannon to the

00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:52,189
drone having meats running around could

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,779
result only in one outcome the

00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:56,660
unconditional surrender of the screw off

00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:59,180
so the screws are nicely behaved now and

00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,800
then they cooperate with us and you know

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,059
they do the cute things they just eat

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,339
peanuts they don't throw them at

00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:09,079
allergic people so my summary so using

00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:10,519
bluetooth it's fun and it's quite easy

00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:12,319
once you know the commands that you want

00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,779
to use if you want to see a couple of

00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:17,300
examples that I was talking about you

00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:20,870
could go to NPM search for any of these

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,610
three also you should use native script

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,290
when you want to have a native Android

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:28,160
or iOS application and connect multiple

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:29,809
devices or use web bluetooth if you want

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,000
to use chrome on mac windows or android

00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:34,699
and i think is iOS as well it's just the

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,129
caveat is on one device at a time and if

00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:38,720
you want to use observables you could

00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:40,610
actually use what seems angular web

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,470
bluetooth which is pretty cool so that

00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:43,790
allows you to actually cancel some of

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,939
the things that you want to listen to

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:49,870
and then finally reverse engineering can

00:14:46,939 --> 00:14:51,730
be tricky sometimes but if you use HCI

00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,490
new blog and Wireshark that can be quite

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,900
helpful and there's some other things

00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,370
that you could be trying for more

00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,800
advanced scenario like you could maybe

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:02,350
explore the the log file and try to

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,820
match for the patterns of the commands

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,770
that you looking for so you could say

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,029
like go and find five identical per

00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,310
month and that's how you could figure

00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:11,470
out or there is a tool i'm working on

00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:14,350
which allows you to actually import the

00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,000
Wireshark log and then run it step by

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,180
step so you can actually see what's

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,280
happening so that's pretty much me and

00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:27,500
thank you for listening

00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,500
