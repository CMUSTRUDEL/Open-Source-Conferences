[Applause]

00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:19,080
hello I'm Joe skein and I'm an angular

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:20,470
developer most usual time a regular

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:28,789
developer

00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:31,410
[Applause]

00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:34,470
today we're here to talk about the

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,809
steppe the world I'm growing up in is

00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,739
different from the world my parents grew

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:45,809
up in we are expected to know a lot more

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,699
about technology to be able to solve the

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,610
problems that they're going to be facing

00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:53,430
in the future there's been a big

00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:56,580
emphasis in education about stem that

00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:05,640
means science technology engineering and

00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:10,020
mathematics sometimes can't even and

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:13,920
can't even be boring and before I can

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:17,009
reason right I explored my world with my

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:21,780
hands ears and other senses I could

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:28,160
create an experiment with the stuff I

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:31,560
had in my world so because of this

00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:36,090
there's a big movement starting to

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:39,210
change stem to steam adding art to the

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,770
mix to encourage kids creativity but

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,369
what does this have to do with

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:48,369
programming

00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:50,869
because angular can put the a into steam

00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:56,810
hold on daddy you're getting ahead of

00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:58,609
yourself you're right all the time the

00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,259
Gwen's been growing up she's always been

00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:07,369
very interested in all the programming

00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:09,769
I've been doing last year I got to come

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:12,830
to Angie coins with my dad and go to

00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:16,130
Angie comp kit I got to make a program

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:18,849
using scratch and control a computer

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,849
with a banana

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,739
we continued programming together and I

00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:33,890
had found a really awesome website I'm

00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:41,490
sorry make my mama Mother's Day card

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:44,290
again yeah okay put your hands down

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:47,510
[Laughter]

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,459
we continued programming together and I

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,019
found a really awesome website that I

00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:54,709
think everyone should know about it's

00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:57,920
studio code org this is a non-profit

00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:00,230
website that was put together by people

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,049
from Microsoft Google Facebook Twitter

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,720
and it's all about helping kids learn to

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:09,290
program whether they're pre readers or

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,139
whether they're in high school my

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:20,269
favorite thing a cool dork is helping

00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:24,769
those zombie from plants vs. zombies so

00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:27,650
flour together it started with angular

00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:31,760
we started with the QuickStart plunker

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:34,819
on angular do as she was able to see how

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,099
changing the HTML where the CSS would

00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:44,599
change the output on the right it helped

00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:46,790
her to get really excited about this to

00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,880
pick your favorite color when you click

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,250
a button it

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:54,180
change the color the words at the top

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,960
then we made it to that you can use the

00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:01,640
button to vote for your favorite color

00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:06,090
of course pink is always at the top I

00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:09,090
don't see programming with Gwen has been

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,070
a fun and rewarding experience she's

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,980
picked up so much more than I ever

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:17,040
expected her to even at her young age

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:21,900
and I hope that we'll be able to

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:27,540
continue to a program for four years to

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:30,960
come I love programming because you can

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,960
make fun things I hope that as it get

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,030
older I could do more programming if you

00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,370
have kids you should try real gramming

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,740
with them just to make sure you stay

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,490
with them to help them ones they have

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,490
questions

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:50,430
[Applause]

00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,959
I just wanted to quickly share a quote

00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:59,019
from President Barack Obama that kind of

00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:01,059
talks about how stem should be much more

00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:03,669
interactive science is much more than a

00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:05,799
school subject a periodic table the

00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:08,529
properties of waves it's an approach to

00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:09,969
the world a critical way to understand

00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:11,949
and explore and engage with the world

00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:15,849
and then have the capacity to change

00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:18,099
that world as we help our kids learn

00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:21,909
programming and interact with them and

00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:24,579
do interactive exercises they'll be more

00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:27,459
prepared for the struggles and the

00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:29,949
challenges that lie ahead and I know

00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:31,460
that you'll enjoy it too thank you

00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:39,500
everybody

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:41,560
[Applause]

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,560
