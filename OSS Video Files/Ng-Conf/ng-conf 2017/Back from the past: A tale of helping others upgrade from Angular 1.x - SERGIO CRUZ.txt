thank you

00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:14,099
was that Nikki er yeah I am from Rolando

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,929
so that'd be totally cool oh sorry

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,990
hermie the Frog okay

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,650
so hello everyone my name is Sergio Cruz

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,230
and today I'm going to talk about

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:27,960
difficulties people face when upgrading

00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:29,849
from angularjs to angular I'm gonna tell

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,700
you a little bit about my history with

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,530
angularjs as well as just some

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,480
experience I've gathered from helping

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,700
people upgrade a couple of things I

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,649
learned along the way I'm a you why

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,899
engineering instructor at code school

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:47,160
and floral site and you can find me on

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:49,289
twitter at hashtag surge and speaking of

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,510
hashtag let's go back in time real quick

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,539
back to 2013

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,350
and back then words like hashtag and

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,170
selfie

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,719
we're just added two major english

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,990
dictionaries but what else happened that

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:10,580
year i wrote my very first angularjs app

00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,930
and back then the steps were very

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,119
straightforward i don't know about you

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,880
but when I wrote my first angular app I

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,430
went to the angularjs website and I

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,060
downloaded the libraries I needed to get

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,850
going once I've done that I throw some I

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,119
throw those strips on the HTML template

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,360
through some script tags wrote some code

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,150
and that was it profit right that's all

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,020
that it took and I absolutely loved it

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,460
it was such a great experience writing

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,290
angularjs back then once you learned it

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,960
and and that was a cool thing about it

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,350
right like once you got those concepts

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,560
down going from idea to conception

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:56,490
happened in no time super fast

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,490
prototyping and I love that that

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,210
although we were able to move vast the

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,729
code still stayed pretty well organized

00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:08,220
lots of good separation of concerns

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,400
happening you see back then I was

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,550
writing a lot of jQuery style of code

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:19,680
and I had no separation of concerns in

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:22,830
that whatsoever just concerns what I

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,160
really loved about learning angularjs

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,320
back then was that it was similar there

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,020
are a lot of similar concepts than what

00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,270
we were already used to on the server

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,360
side of things so you want to talk about

00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,800
MVC in dependency injection so it all

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,840
kind of came you know you'll see you'll

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,430
second nature it was such a good time

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,280
love the angularjs back in 2013 okay

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:51,690
let's come back to the present now we're

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:55,830
back in 2017 and it's time to write our

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:58,920
first client side app and what has

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,170
happened let's go through the steps what

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,050
does it look like when we're writing

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,300
angular today well we start by

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,880
installing the CLI once we've done that

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,640
we use it to generate a project

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,500
oh hello by the way there's this thing

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,500
typescript that we kind of got to get

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,570
used to right use NPM all the things no

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,600
more going to websites and downloading

00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,940
scripts manually like I did in 2013 by

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,090
the way no script tags either that's all

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,239
handled handled automatically for us by

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,970
the CLI which is great but there's a lot

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,570
of you know magic happening and when you

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,750
get stuck where do you go for help well

00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,590
it's my sound a little bit

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,080
over-exaggerated you know a little bit

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:47,730
funny perhaps but this happens to new

00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,769
angular devs all the time it might sound

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,510
like it's a problem with angular but

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,590
it's really not it's a problem with

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:57,390
writing modern JavaScript today in 2017

00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,920
you see there's a lots of game right

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:01,380
there's a lot of cool things that we

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,720
that we're doing we're reusing nodejs on

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,160
the client-side so and with that we get

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,320
to use things like web pack to use

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,049
modules so there's no dependency on

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,910
global state anymore we get to take

00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:15,840
advantage take advantage of modern

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:18,549
languages like typescript or even es2015

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,400
right yes 2016 2017 is Friday

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:24,789
come on I don't know and the whole

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,590
JavaScript world it's just not limited

00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:29,680
to browsers anymore no that's long gone

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,800
just the other day I recorded a video on

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,129
how to fly a drone using javascript and

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,659
that happened with five lines of code

00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:40,409
it's super cool now all this cool stuff

00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:41,979
is happening while we're keeping things

00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:45,159
backwards-compatible right what I mean

00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:48,460
by that is that well people who are

00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:50,740
still using older browsers those users

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,830
they can't be left behind which still

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,599
needs to cater for them as well so you

00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,629
know we're moving fast but we can't

00:04:55,599 --> 00:05:02,680
leave them behind and we're also loops

00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:06,879
and we're also learning best practices

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,009
of gosh my bad as we go what I mean by

00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,840
that is we're really making up best

00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:18,250
practices like every other week you know

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:21,219
what I'm talking about so lots of so a

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,409
lots have changed it's not like just

00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:27,219
throwing script tags on the page anymore

00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:29,199
right it's well beyond that but you know

00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:32,110
it's become a little bit more difficult

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,240
especially to onboard new developers as

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,729
well right and now and you might be

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,460
thinking just you know fresh grad grads

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:42,240
but but not really I have a lot of good

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:45,250
friends to have spent a lot of time in

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,020
focusing on other areas of programming

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,360
and now they want to get on board it on

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,550
the client side and I always feel bad

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,009
because they're not just learning the

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,860
language they're learning a whole set of

00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:59,560
tools just to get going so there's a lot

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,779
to gain lots of amazing things happening

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,340
with JavaScript but it definitely comes

00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:08,319
at a price this is what I call a trade

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:10,150
off so javascript has gotten harder

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,129
right and we need to kind of take it

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,050
upon ourselves to help newcomers get

00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:15,219
going if you're an experienced developer

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,629
I'm sure

00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:21,550
perhaps there's maybe a more a newer

00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,840
person that's just getting started at

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,909
your job taking upon yourself to help

00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,250
them out and we'll talk a little bit

00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:29,469
about a little bit more about this as we

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,710
go by the way I'm also kind of live

00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:32,420
tweeting azzam

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,790
doing the stock it's pretty magic it's

00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,010
great so we talked about angular well we

00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,260
talked about JavaScript and and the

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,930
challenges that are happening with

00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:46,340
JavaScript in 2017 right let's be a

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:49,730
little bit more specific to angular is

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,920
it what's what's scarier

00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:54,170
or what's into dating about it is it the

00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:56,660
fact that we need to use typescript but

00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:59,420
we don't have to use it but most people

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,980
do right and I mean if you look at this

00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,910
file it definitely has a lot of

00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:08,210
characters that was not in my es5 files

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:10,990
back in 2013 when I wrote angularjs it's

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:14,290
it's different right or is it the

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:19,490
template syntax same thing right we have

00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:21,830
lots of new characters on our HTML you

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,560
know stars for you know structure

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,960
directives or is it you know square

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,000
brackets and parentheses is that that is

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,610
it the template syntax or is it the

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,610
command-line tools i by the way i

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:37,520
absolutely love angular CLI it's it's

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:40,790
great the fact that I get to focus on

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,830
building my product instead of you know

00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,330
all of the how am I going to run this

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,400
and how are we gonna run tests and

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,470
whatnot it's pretty great but the fact

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,970
that we even have one the fact the fact

00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:51,860
that we you know it's that's kind of the

00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,020
recommended way to starting an app it

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,170
just goes to show how really

00:07:54,020 --> 00:08:00,140
intimidating this whole new ecosystem

00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:02,960
has become so let's talk about some

00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:05,360
actual challenges I ran into when

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,460
helping people upgrade and the first

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,290
thing that came up a lot was a lot of

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,120
code that was mixed with server-side

00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,550
code what I'm talking about is perhaps

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,590
you have a ruby on rails app and now

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,550
you're running angularjs at the same

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,450
time oh for angularjs that's mostly okay

00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,790
right but now if we want to start

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,460
talking about the the whole modern set

00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:27,980
of tools it requires a lot of

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:31,160
configuration files to get going right

00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:34,220
so for testing for say your web pack

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,340
config for example and they start having

00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:39,590
some competing priorities on the

00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,760
codebase that's a challenge that we

00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,169
usually face the other thing is

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,540
CoffeeScript a lot of people still use

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,329
the script and since one of the things I

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,399
recommend before upgrading is to use

00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:52,529
typescript I understand you don't have

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,420
to but it's it's just the recommended

00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:58,620
way just do it is what I tell

00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:00,120
individuals I help out with and yeah the

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,829
first thing we've got to do is go from

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,560
CoffeeScript to typescript how do you do

00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:07,860
that we found some automated ways of

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,350
doing it of accomplishing it but it was

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:14,160
never perfect okay it's never a solution

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:16,769
that we're super happy with now go ahead

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,880
and skip the next few Bower and grunts

00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:22,500
there you know a little bit over I don't

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,600
know they're a little bit old now there

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,250
are better solutions that have replaced

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,610
them but a lot of people still use it

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,740
and to go from angularjs to angular you

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,930
know there are it's a little bit more

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,839
difficult you know I wanted to really

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:40,139
understand I wanted to know if these

00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,370
problems I was facing these challenges I

00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:43,649
was running into were they

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:47,430
representative of the community at large

00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:48,930
so I teamed up with the group of really

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,029
smart people we use something called

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,010
science serene I don't have ever heard

00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:56,070
of it science is pretty cool but yeah we

00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:58,170
so this was led out by Jeff Whelpley by

00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,660
the way thanks Jeff and what happened

00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,180
was we sent out a survey just asking

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,920
people about their upgrade process

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:07,110
timeline what tools were they using and

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,510
whatnot here are some of the findings um

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,199
this word cloud you see here with the

00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,279
angular logo there was an open

00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:16,769
open-ended question on there we just

00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:20,220
asked people hey what challenges what

00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:22,140
difficulties did you run into and I made

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,440
this word cloud based on their answers

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:27,269
and we can see here two to the right of

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,180
the a the first thing that comes up is

00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:33,470
time right we could see time to the left

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:36,569
we can see change type scripts their

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:39,149
upgrade let's talk about those pain

00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:41,370
points a little bit more detailed um the

00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:43,680
first thing that came up a lot was time

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,889
and priority you see people couldn't

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,470
afford to just stop what they were doing

00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:51,750
and start you know writing angular and

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,279
their code it just wasn't a thing they

00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,640
had to keep moving they had to keep

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,410
shipping features

00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,770
the next one is directly related to this

00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:02,330
business incentive you see a lot of

00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:05,240
businesses they don't make more money

00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,339
just by writing with latest you know the

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,750
latest and greatest tools it's the real

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:10,880
world that you were talking about here

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,649
you know this is not how many happens so

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,610
there's you know some very little

00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:18,680
incentive to get going now I understand

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,480
the reasoning behind it I understand

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,610
that you know dis testability is better

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,890
and you know your codes more mature and

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,330
less bugs and when I put a lot up a lot

00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,240
of these businesses don't specially

00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:32,540
those that aren't very tech savvy and

00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,000
when I then we get into the hesitation

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,820
or fear area a little bit so team

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,730
proficiency came up a lot what do I mean

00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:44,480
by that seem proficiency well a lot of

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:46,730
people knew angularjs really well and

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,920
they didn't want to relearn that from

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:51,500
scratch they didn't want to learn a new

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,279
framework from scratch and that's what

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,450
it felt like to upgrade to angular

00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,920
third-party libraries was huge as well

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,380
you see there are a lot of libraries

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,420
that they have the angularjs version

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:05,870
over here then they have the angular

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:08,180
version over here but there's no upgrade

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,700
path there's no bridge between them and

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,339
that when people decide to upgrade from

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:16,150
angularjs to angular we're talking about

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:18,380
a rewrite and that's a challenge right

00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:21,290
and all of the tooling that we already

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,870
talked about especially you know

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,630
old-school style of writing JavaScript

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,920
no tooling was needed for now we

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:31,820
definitely need a whole lot of tooling

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,160
so I can only conclude that the angular

00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,990
the new angular syntax is not the reason

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,270
why aren't people aren't upgrading mmhmm

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:41,029
I think it's more related to time to

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:43,010
learn and fear of change as well as

00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:44,540
business restraints and whatnot but you

00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:48,680
can only fit so many characters in a

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,540
tweet right what can we what can we do

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,480
about it though how to go about it

00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,310
especially if you're still writing

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,980
angularjs today and you've probably

00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:00,260
heard many of these advices over and

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,290
over again but let's go through them

00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:05,680
it'll be worth it so first thing that

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,680
comes up

00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:12,529
first thing that we can do is definitely

00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:15,230
approach things using a component based

00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:18,139
architecture right so starting with 1.5

00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:20,660
I imagine a lot of us know this we have

00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:23,239
this new API that's more directly

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,089
transferable in an upgrade from

00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:27,889
angularjs to angular so instead of just

00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:29,660
spending a lot of time and you know

00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:31,759
reengineering your whole app and how it

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:35,209
works to go from angularjs to angular to

00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:37,129
stick to take a step back and somebody I

00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:40,610
really respect said this that his last

00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:44,029
name rhymes with memes Joe Eames pretty

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,889
cool guy anyway he said and I really

00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:47,839
liked it so I'm definitely misquoting

00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:51,259
him on here but whatever paraphrasing if

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,579
you look at a page andrey architected in

00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:54,860
your mind using component-based

00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:57,619
architecture so instead of trying to

00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,540
approach it the old way with controllers

00:13:57,619 --> 00:14:01,339
and obscure directives and all of that

00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,019
just approach it with components and I

00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:05,119
completely agree with that because that

00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:07,819
would be practically directly

00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:10,160
transferable from angularjs to angular

00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:12,829
they're the thing is don't do like I did

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,959
back when I wrote my first angular JSF

00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:17,149
in 2013 you see my app was in a full

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,329
single page application no it was a

00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:21,889
container within a website and that

00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:24,559
would have been a whole lot more

00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:27,199
difficult let's just write full single

00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:29,149
page applications in consume an API or

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,709
not that will make life a whole lot

00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:38,059
easier it's goes along with the whole

00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:41,089
dedicated you know repo and whatnot npm

00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:43,749
let's just use npm or yarn means same

00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:46,519
effect right but that will allow for

00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:47,990
modules to be used it's a it's the next

00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,269
step yet remember when I had to go to

00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:53,419
the angular website and download code

00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:56,269
well NPM automates this and more right

00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:58,279
now we get modules that become available

00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:00,230
and if we have them now we can take

00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,360
advantage of web pack and completely

00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:05,449
remove that dependency from the global

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,629
state from the window object and if we

00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:10,819
have web pack then using typescript kind

00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:12,319
of becomes a no-brainer so if we take

00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:14,509
these steps and I understand that for

00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:18,130
some of you depending on how you wrote

00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:21,140
angularjs will be a very difficult

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,850
to adopt some of these steps but keep

00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,800
them in mind maybe as a blueprint or

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,769
something and and just take you know

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,540
micro steps towards this because when

00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:34,370
you follow these steps it'll be a whole

00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:36,920
lot easier now if you if there's a

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:39,920
legitimate reason why you haven't been

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,779
able to upgrade I feel your pain I'm

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,990
with you and I'm going to do everything

00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:46,610
I can to help you move forward and I'm

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,660
gonna take the liberty to speak on

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,720
behalf of this whole community

00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,390
especially the angular team we're with

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,339
you we hear you okay don't feel like

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,779
we've left you behind or anything like

00:15:55,339 --> 00:16:00,860
that

00:15:55,779 --> 00:16:02,390
in the survey a lot a lot of individuals

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,269
that were still using a certain version

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:08,480
of angularjs because they still have to

00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:10,519
support Internet Explorer eight so

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,589
that's that's a legitimate you know

00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:14,240
constraint so there are legitimate

00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:16,100
reasons why people aren't doing it so

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,140
hey you know just make sure your voice

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,750
is heard but but don't feel like we've

00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,420
forgotten you or anything like that and

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:27,470
note that you can sit with us know that

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:30,740
um yeah I love that just Brad green or

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,839
other angular team individuals they

00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,670
always wear the t-shirt that reads you

00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:36,770
can sit with us identify one for myself

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,570
as well and I believe we ended the last

00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:41,990
time you come for this as well and and

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,430
it's so true it's so representative of

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,430
the angular team and this whole

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,660
community as a whole

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:50,270
everyone's so approachable if you have

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:53,329
questions just walk up to people and ask

00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:54,800
see if you forget everything I've said

00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:56,690
in this talk today I want you to

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,730
remember just one word and that word

00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,310
would be empathy you see if you're

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,410
experienced I've mentioned this before

00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,660
but if you're experienced just take the

00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:09,589
time to help somebody out you know I I

00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,030
remember feeling so left out you know if

00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:12,800
I can be vulnerable and completely

00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,589
transparent here for a second when

00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,230
everyone was so hyped up about Redux it

00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,850
didn't make any sense to me like isn't

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,980
this the same thing as just throwing

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,720
some data in a factory and sharing it

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,419
with the bunch of controllers I don't

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,510
get it and finally someone took the time

00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:31,169
to break it down for me and explain why

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,119
it was a ver

00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:34,889
good way of approaching and I agree and

00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,470
I'll never forget that you see you could

00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:39,840
be that person for somebody as well we

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,509
all have silly questions and and while

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,789
we're probably afraid of admitting right

00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:45,539
know that there's none of that you can

00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:48,659
sit with us

00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:50,190
you see if you're a library author you

00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:52,799
chew you can make a difference as well

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,779
just write some really approachable code

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:59,279
examples this will make a huge

00:17:54,779 --> 00:18:01,109
difference and and and if you're just

00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,139
starting out if you're a newcomer and

00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:05,609
you run into this library that you just

00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:09,210
can't make any sense out of it

00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:11,730
let the authors know or even better try

00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,409
to understand it and then try to come up

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,600
with I don't know a little guide or code

00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:17,909
examples that make sense to you or

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,619
people that are similar to you and open

00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:20,369
a pull request you see empathy is a

00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:22,470
two-way street

00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:24,539
you know authors they're really busy as

00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:27,090
well doing the awesome things that they

00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:33,720
do so you know we could all kind of help

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:37,109
each other out here and if you haven't

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,600
learned angular yet then why not I kind

00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:42,119
of just want to end with this if you

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,409
haven't learned angular yet what's

00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,070
keeping you from doing so I just made up

00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:48,960
the city

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:50,909
hashtag here why learn angular I want to

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,070
know what's going on how would I you

00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:54,929
know I might work at code school and

00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,509
Pluralsight and make a lot of teaching

00:18:54,929 --> 00:19:01,679
material there and I want to help you I

00:18:57,509 --> 00:19:02,730
want to make content okay but we need to

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,029
know what's going on

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:08,179
