thanks Kevin that was that was wonderful

00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:14,309
guys I'm so stoked to be here so I was I

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,170
was here two years ago in the audience

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,359
and I honestly never thought that I

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,189
would be on this stage I'm really

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,480
humbled and excited to share this

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:26,760
experience with you today I have had

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,000
professional experience using both

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,130
angular and react to clarify when I say

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,530
angular what I really mean is angularjs

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,809
but I've been using the word angular so

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,050
long it's hard for me to say angularjs

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,840
but I mean angular one so I've first

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,379
learned angular at boot camp called Def

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:51,329
Mountain I ended up teaching there for a

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:53,579
while as well teaching angular I worked

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:57,840
for start-up called Sparrow doing react

00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:01,739
and I currently work for Domo doing

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,110
angular so this this journey between

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,909
these different frameworks is what I

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,890
want to share with you today but before

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,280
we dive into that I want to ask you guys

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,350
a question have you ever had a phase in

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,750
your development career where you've had

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,210
difficulty defining who you are or or

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,150
what you do raise your hand if you feel

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,439
like you've gone through that before

00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,500
maybe like am i an angular developer and

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,180
my front end engineer okay so some of

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,020
you like prob like a third of yeah

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,490
awesome so that's the experience that I

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,030
want to share with you today is my

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,950
struggle with that early in my

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,130
development career I wanted to define

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,740
myself by my framework when I first

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,970
learned angular I loved it to death I

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,250
thought it was so cool

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,570
I loved how quickly you could get a

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,220
project up and running and it was the

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,700
first time but I felt like a real

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,399
developer I didn't take very long for me

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,140
to hear about react and technically I

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,210
loved react I thought it was very cool

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,070
and a lot of the developers that I

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,310
personally knew were moving towards

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,129
react eventually I got a full-time job

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,300
doing react and I defined myself as a

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:14,950
react developer

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:17,630
for a while everything was great until

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,820
it wasn't anymore

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,960
my circumstance has changed and I found

00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,580
that I was suddenly looking for a job

00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,710
fortunately I was still in Utah and

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,680
there's a lot of opportunities here in

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:34,410
Utah it eventually boiled down to two

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,820
different opportunities that I felt were

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,000
that was where I needed to make my

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:43,800
decision I could have to do angular with

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,150
Domo or react with another company now

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,090
this was a difficult decision for me

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,460
because I felt like I define myself as a

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,580
react developer and so so that other job

00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,190
kind of called to me but really I felt

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,280
like the opportunity at Domo was just an

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,310
all-around better opportunity it was a

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,360
difficult decision for me but I went

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,800
with Domo and I haven't regretted it

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,270
I've really enjoyed meeting the people

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:13,010
there and I've had wonderful experiences

00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:17,430
especially for my personal development

00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:19,710
but the transition was interesting for

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,000
me at first I continued to define myself

00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:25,560
as a react engineer as a react developer

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,690
it was difficult for me to swallow the

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,660
fact that I was doing angular as a react

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,220
developer but it didn't take too long

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,570
and I saw that my efforts were adding

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,680
value to this company and I decided I

00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:41,010
don't want to be a reactive developer

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:47,090
anymore I don't want to be an anything

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:51,060
developer I just want to be a builder an

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:54,900
X developer is defined by his or her

00:03:51,060 --> 00:04:00,120
tools but a builder can simply use the

00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:03,570
best tool for the job it's still okay to

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,520
have a preference for tools but issues

00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,860
arise when you are turning down

00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,080
otherwise worthy opportunities simply

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,060
because those opportunities are using

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,709
tools or frameworks that you don't

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,359
define yourself with and the most

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,690
important thing is that you are

00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:24,030
providing value whether that's in your

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,510
career or your open-source projects or

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,250
personal projects your efforts should be

00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,790
helping you to accomplish the goals of

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,790
those projects

00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,479
last I want to talk directly to those

00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:39,849
who might be going this through this

00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:43,749
kind of transition right now or in the

00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:48,069
coming months I love this tweet because

00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:51,759
it perfectly communicates how practice

00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:53,949
and effort and skill will always be far

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,240
more important than the tools that you

00:04:53,949 --> 00:05:01,300
use you can provide value today in the

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,310
projects that you're working on find the

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,069
most ambitious and exciting

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,020
opportunities that you can and simply

00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:12,250
use whatever tech you can to fulfill

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:18,990
those opportunities thank you

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,990
