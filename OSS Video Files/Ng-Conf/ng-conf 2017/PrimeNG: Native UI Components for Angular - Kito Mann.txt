all right hello everybody hear me in the

back way back there I'm kind of

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,280
soft-spoken so I have to test out these

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,590
thing okay all right so welcome this

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,869
session is called a prime in G native UI

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:21,539
components for angular everybody in join

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,359
the conference is my first time so I'm

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,830
enjoying I think it's really cool so

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,910
does anyone like Faraday better than

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:34,739
previous day different vibe more food I

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:39,469
guess better presentations okay doesn't

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:43,770
bode well for me I guess all right cool

00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:45,510
all right well my name is Kido the

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,030
principal consultant at my own little

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,739
firm called Virtua where we do a

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,870
training consulting mint consulting

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,090
mentoring etc with a whole bunch of

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,949
different technologies but a lot of

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,469
friends stuff and also some java ee

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,629
stuff as well and also polymer web

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,969
components and Prime and G stuff like

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,519
that and for years they've been an

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,979
official partner of a company called

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,110
prime tech which produces Prime and G

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,470
and also produces another product called

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,390
primefaces and we're pleased to be

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,909
working with them on the angular side of

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,420
things with prime enjoy how many people

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:24,060
here have ever written any Java code

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,070
alright good okay so there's a podcast

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,170
called the enterprise Java newscast that

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,700
I'm the co-host of we actually talk

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,820
about lots of different technologies not

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,829
just Java we talk about actually angular

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,390
and web components and front-end

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,979
development and everything everything

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,360
related to enterprise development so if

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:51,649
you like podcast you should check that

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:54,689
out ok so what is prime in G you know

00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:57,000
prime in G I'm sorry angular is all

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,229
about components right but when it comes

00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,850
to actually building an application you

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,799
need actual real widgets to work with

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,020
that can make your application look good

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,560
without you spitting lots of time trying

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,509
to get the perfect data school or

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,930
component written

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:13,430
so prime ng provides over 70 responsive

00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:17,540
UI components that are actually native

00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:19,549
to angular and it's really easy to use

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,409
and you'll see some examples of how you

00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:24,440
can just very easily use in Prime and G

00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:25,700
component also has accessibility built

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,129
in which is an important thing for

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:33,620
enterprise development and governments

00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:36,200
and it's open source and it's also

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,760
derived from the primefaces product that

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,489
I mentioned earlier how many people have

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,780
heard of prime faces I'm just curious so

00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:44,209
there's a few of you out there okay

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,299
so prime faces is a product from the

00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:49,069
Java world and it's both on a technology

00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:50,840
called JavaServer faces which has been

00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,519
around a long time and came around

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,340
really before the rise of all the

00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,620
JavaScript web frameworks out there but

00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,500
over the years primefaces has really

00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,170
become the number one set of UI

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,230
components for building these java JSF

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,030
applications and what that means is that

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,910
prime Tech has really gained a lot of

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:14,090
experience building UI components that

00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,739
work for you know enterprises and

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,239
government organizations and also

00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:19,310
startups and smaller companies as well

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,380
and I've been happy to work with them

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,709
along the way doing a lot of a training

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:27,049
consulting mentoring that kind of stuff

00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:28,730
and what's interesting is sort of

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,349
watching the journey of this product

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,620
because you know we have prime faces

00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:36,950
great product but you know angular's 2

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:40,069
was coming out and I was talking to the

00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:42,769
lead developer about you know what to do

00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:44,810
next in terms of UI components we talked

00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:47,180
about web components things like that

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,349
which I'm very very interested in but

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,700
you know we also talked about angular

00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:54,590
and basically they decided to double

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:59,269
down on angular angular 2 at the time

00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:01,549
and now it's been over a year later and

00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:03,799
there's a really beautiful set of

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:07,430
components and what's interesting is

00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:09,500
that the initial code that was used for

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,030
Prime and G came partially from prime

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,359
faces and also from another project

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:16,700
called prime UI which is just pure you

00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:20,120
know JavaScript widgets to have no tied

00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,760
any particular framework and over time a

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,320
lot of the internals of those

00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,000
opponent to morphs because a lot of them

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,320
use jQuery internally because you know

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,980
if you wrote components a few years ago

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,810
you probably use jQuery right but what's

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,280
happened over time is these components

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,010
have evolved become pure angular

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,630
components that there's very very little

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,540
jQuery usually it's in a third party

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,830
extension that's being wrapped so it's

00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,890
really nice to have a really powerful

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:49,600
set of native angular components and

00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,880
another question we always get is to use

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,620
is this product so it's open source but

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,190
it's also a professional Enterprise

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,510
degraded product and these are just a

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,700
few of the companies there's plenty of

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,320
other ones as well but the key thing is

00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,350
that they're designed to be you know

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,670
enterprise already but also obviously if

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,730
you're not enterprise and great to use

00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:11,620
as well and what we seen from primefaces

00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,260
is that has been very popular in

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,610
governments and large companies and I

00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,070
think we'll see the same thing with parm

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,130
and G but also the angular space has a

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,530
lot more sort of dynamic group of people

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,680
right not all big companies lots of

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,660
startups lots of individuals so we're

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,740
happy to provide a product for them as

00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:37,650
well all right so let's get into it

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,650
let's look at the demo so if you go to

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,570
this URL here on my left at it you go to

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,660
a prime face is that word prime in G

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,700
you'll find this showcase and what's

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,500
nice about this showcase is that not

00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,950
only is it a great way to look at all

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,980
the components but it's also a angular

00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,690
app okay so anything you see here you

00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,040
can actually mess with on your own if

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,020
you just clone the prime engineer

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,610
apposite or e and run the app and

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,800
actually so what I'm running here is

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,500
actually my local installation of the

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,110
app but there's lots of different

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:15,070
components and there's everything from

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:18,280
the we just reload this to be safe from

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:23,620
basic info controls all the way down to

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:25,810
data components charge menus etc so I

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:30,490
want to start by looking at a very

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,410
simple example so you know the very

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,480
common thing you might want is input

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,490
control right and you can of course use

00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,460
your standard name for

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,200
it works fine but by using the primary

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,940
components you get all the seaming

00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,480
that's built in let's talk a little bit

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:47,460
more about seams in a minute but by

00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,290
using the primary versions you actually

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,910
get access to sort of integrating with

00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,940
the look and feel the rest of the

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,530
primary components and if you how many

00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,140
people attended the material talked

00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,480
yesterday on the evolution of material

00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:04,590
and see that that's different one I

00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,000
guess but but basically they you know

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,330
the components have sort of two

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,650
different you know approaches right they

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,840
have the directive approach and then the

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,240
pure component approach and primary is

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,350
really try to pick the right tool for

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,430
the job so they didn't reinvent the

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:24,480
input control they would just added a

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:27,600
directive for it okay so basically just

00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,390
by having your very simple info control

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,460
and then using the P input text

00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,350
directive you basically get a prime into

00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,410
control right nothing too exciting about

00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,850
this one but what's key here is that all

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,460
these components they're very easy to

00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:44,880
use with angular CLI or in a project it

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,800
doesn't use a CLI so using it just like

00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,410
any other module right you can this is

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,060
what you would put in your app module

00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:54,000
and then to the source for this is

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,400
really just a very simple you know input

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,560
control and the beauty of using

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,480
directive here is that you know all of

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,220
the standard attributes for an input

00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,120
input or RB there you don't have to

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,350
reinvent the wheel for them so move on

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,740
let's talk a little bit more interesting

00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:12,930
here is an input switch component so I

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,000
love these I think we've all all decided

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,150
these are much cooler than checkboxes as

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,770
long as you have the screen real estate

00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:24,300
so just a template simple toggle right

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:27,210
and again it's got a very simple usage

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,190
pattern right we've got a your model you

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,950
have a check property and that's what

00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,870
you use is your energy model okay and

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,330
also if you are using model driven

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,220
reforms all of the input controls work

00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:42,630
fine with those as well so it's not an

00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:44,280
issue and as you get to more complicated

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,450
components you'll find more features

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,190
right so there's lots of different

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,020
attributes you can provide as well and

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,320
you know for something like this it's

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,600
really

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,330
just the labels that you want to use

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,870
whether you want to what you want to say

00:08:54,330 --> 00:09:01,770
when the the inputs which is toggled on

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:07,980
and off okay so here's a customized

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:10,080
label this is the default so then we can

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,240
go to some things which are a little

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,800
more interesting so you know if you want

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,360
to have an actual text editor in your

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,460
application you could do that as well

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,590
now primary you did not write it write a

00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,790
text editor from scratch this is a

00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:25,440
wrapper around quill

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:28,860
okay and quill is a pretty nice little

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,510
editor but the key here is that you

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,070
don't have to actually import quill and

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,530
try to get to look good with primefaces

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:42,210
and try to innovate with angular that

00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:45,480
work is done for you okay and we can do

00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,560
all your sort of basic stuff here and

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,000
you can see here's the value that's

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,920
actually being passed to the angular

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,780
component okay

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,670
it can also use all the you know

00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:57,240
customization features that quill has

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:59,460
available okay so again the usage is

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,250
really similar simpler simple excuse me

00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,920
you basically you know import your the

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,230
module I'm a shared module is something

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:11,820
which is used by all of the primary

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:14,400
components and you basically can bind it

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,780
up to your model and you basically get a

00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,490
string back alright so strain is going

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,710
to have whatever formatting the quill

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,850
editor has applied to it so you see up

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:27,830
here we actually see the h2 bell

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,830
generated here okay

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:39,470
all right so another one that I like is

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,770
the chips component I think these are

00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,090
cute so uh so this is this is the

00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,490
component where you basically put in

00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:49,490
multiple values you know multiple values

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:52,910
Evelynn ship and you can select and

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:56,600
deselect from them you know and what's

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:58,010
nice is a lot of the prime importance of

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,560
angular templates so that you can

00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:03,470
provide custom layout and formatting for

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,730
different parts of your component so if

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:09,560
you wanted to actually do something

00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:11,390
different you can right so here we have

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,490
a custom template that actually has a

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:18,140
little icon and some additional text

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:21,410
okay so if you look down here this is

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:24,400
that example here with the P chips and

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:27,580
here is the ng template right here okay

00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,030
can you guys read this in the back

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,910
alright cool

00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:33,350
I like these these screens are pretty

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,360
good all right

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,130
so and then looks like all the other

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,530
ones they're different attributes you

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:44,150
can use to customize them alright so

00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,740
those are basic input controls obviously

00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,730
there's more I'm going to go through

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,020
every component I'm just going to give

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:53,540
you a sense of what's available and how

00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:57,670
they all kind of work okay another sort

00:11:53,540 --> 00:12:01,520
of popular area our data controls right

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:03,410
so I think there is probably two that I

00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,170
think are pretty pretty cool of course

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,670
there's things like trees and tree table

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,830
and stuff like that which are cool for

00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,750
especially for financial applications

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,930
where you really need to condense a lot

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,940
of data data scroller I think is a good

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,560
one because it gives you a few different

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,590
possibilities for how you want to do

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,020
scrolling right so you can do scrolling

00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:28,130
to sort of this way you can dynamically

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:31,100
load additional records okay you can

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:34,960
also control whether you want the

00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,960
scrollbar to be inline or not

00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:45,320
so then you see we're loading more as we

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,320
go on okay

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:53,040
and if you want you can actually just

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,440
see no just wire open event handler to

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,710
load more more for more records there as

00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,360
well and of course you can do the the

00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:04,610
requisite infinite scrolling all right

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:08,120
where you just grow on forever right and

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:11,490
what's nice about this is that the

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,830
approach is is just really really

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,140
straightforward now we've all worked

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,580
with different frameworks and different

00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:22,380
components they have different ways of

00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:24,960
handling that lazy loading data right so

00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,420
the the primary approach is basically

00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:31,470
you see if I can find the right example

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,250
here we go to just have a very simple

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,670
callback

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:38,610
I've been handler that you can implement

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:41,220
and basically it takes an event the

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,510
event has first rows and then you do

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,480
whatever you need to do you talk to your

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,860
service or you know maybe you have some

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,350
records in memory and just run a splice

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,730
and array who knows but it's a very

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,900
simple callback and it works very

00:13:50,730 --> 00:14:00,810
efficiently for just loading more

00:13:51,900 --> 00:14:05,910
records into the Dom alright so then

00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:07,380
there is the popular component which i

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,810
think is popular in every single

00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,220
business application I often wonder if

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,810
one day we'll come up with a metaphor

00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:18,150
better than the grid I don't think we

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:20,730
have quite yet but uh but the grid the

00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:23,760
prime faces grid is definitely the best

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,900
grid I've ever worked with and having

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,990
worked with different grids over the

00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:30,600
years I'm very happy to see that the

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,790
progress of the data table for Prime and

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,740
G and as you can see it has lots of

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,350
different features right so I'm not

00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,790
going to go through all these but of

00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,640
course you can very easily get a basic

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,170
table you also can do dynamic columns

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,720
which is a very common thing when you

00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,310
know that the the actual data you're

00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,470
going to display is going to depend upon

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,600
something back from the server maybe

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,190
only some people can see certain fields

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,519
maybe some fields are going to be hit

00:14:53,190 --> 00:15:00,089
and shown who knows so let's see if we

00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:08,850
can find the let's go back to the

00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:14,579
dynamic columns here which I'm not

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:18,449
actually saying all right so if we look

00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:20,610
at here's here's an example so there's

00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:24,620
the P column component but also you can

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:27,300
use it to render dynamic columns as well

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:31,380
another thing I want to look at is

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:35,490
facets so facets is a common term in the

00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:37,920
jsf space basically just means a named

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,529
child component that has some some

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,620
feature in web components land it's

00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:46,170
essentially a slot in the shadow Dom but

00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,790
but basically it just makes it easy for

00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,079
you to say okay I have my component and

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,029
then I want to have some child component

00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:53,010
that has some feature that's related to

00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:55,949
it so for data tables the common thing

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:58,350
is a header and a footer so if we look

00:15:55,949 --> 00:16:01,079
at this we see P header and P footer

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:04,279
here okay and of course you can put

00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,279
whatever content you want in there

00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,190
and also when it comes to the data that

00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,540
you want to put inside of your

00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,910
individual columns you can actually use

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,620
templating there okay so you can see

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,990
we're changing things dynamically we

00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:29,410
have you know the ability to handle

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:31,600
selection here okay and so this is

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:34,360
basically the deal is that for any

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,120
column you can of course just have this

00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,470
field the property of the car right

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,990
which is basically just saying okay I'm

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:43,360
great it to other cars and this is going

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,500
to play it display that property okay so

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,640
you notice the usage is slightly

00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:50,620
different than than the ng-repeat right

00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,590
a little bit different but it but the

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:58,720
features are pretty much the same or in

00:16:53,590 --> 00:17:02,800
g4 so here is the examples using that

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,630
template and you see we basically dump

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:10,810
some additional styling for this column

00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:13,660
only okay and for the column that has

00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:16,240
the select button we see you see it's a

00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,959
iron faces button and we're just

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:24,060
handling the click the click event okay

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:26,620
and what the click event is doing is

00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:30,580
actually calling the Select karmis

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:33,190
method which is adding a message to this

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,800
messages array okay so there's another

00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:38,200
primary faces feature which is a message

00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,640
sort of a very simple way to display

00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,910
messages there's two components as a

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,320
growl component and a message component

00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,550
which we can look at in more detail but

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,080
essentially what's happening here is

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,720
we're updating the array of messages

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,190
those messages are actually they're not

00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,290
shown here but they're actually they are

00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:56,140
right here they're bound to this growl

00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:59,740
up here okay so in that value changes

00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:03,060
we're getting this a nice little growl

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,060
at the top okay

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:10,620
so another common thing is having an

00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,700
editable editable data table okay so

00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,510
this is basically the feature to have

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,340
inline cells being editable okay so

00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,840
basically for any of these fields you

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,220
can just click on it and then change the

00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,200
value and you notice you could also put

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,600
in custom like additional components

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,560
that's not just limited to a simple edit

00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:32,190
control okay so here I'm changing the

00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:35,850
value here okay but also I can pick from

00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:37,380
a drop-down here okay and here I can get

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,960
a calendar component so there's also a

00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,780
calendar component as well

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,820
okay and the way this works is pretty

00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,670
straightforward so again we're iterating

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,440
through all the cars right

00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,090
and here we're saying that the field

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,320
that we're operating on the property of

00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:58,320
the car is brand okay and we're saying

00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,580
it's editable so then inside of it we

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,200
can throw in an entry template if you

00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,890
want to customize it so it's not just a

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,390
simple input control and we can use the

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,170
P drop-down component which is another

00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:13,710
input control from prime in G and you

00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:18,050
can basically bind that directly to that

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:18,050
car that's being displayed okay

00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:30,500
all right so that's that's the editable

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,880
feature of course is also lazy loading

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:40,750
it's also really easy to do crud stuff

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:50,150
so here is a very simple crud example

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:51,110
delete you can add cetera and what's

00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:54,770
nice about this since you don't really

00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:58,550
have to do anything special okay so here

00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:00,980
is that data table again right there is

00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:07,120
a row selection event there's some other

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:09,890
features okay and basically what happens

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:17,210
excuse me is when you click on the Add

00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:23,450
button we're going to be launching this

00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:25,130
show dialog to add method okay show

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:29,390
dialog to add basically just creates in

00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:35,690
your car and then displays the dialog

00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:37,100
okay that dialogue is bound to the car

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:45,590
which is basically the currently

00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:47,330
selected car okay so all the fields in

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,520
here whether it's like the input text or

00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,410
etc they're all pointing to car which is

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,460
the currently selected car the one we

00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:57,160
just added okay and then when someone

00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:03,230
clicks on the Save button

00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:06,260
okay we go back to our component and you

00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:08,120
basically just pushing the car right so

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,650
the grid actually handles all of the

00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,640
change detection to update the display

00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,640
and everything for you

00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:22,930
okay so probably there's only couple

00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:25,030
more things here filtering is a big

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:27,010
thing and what I really like about the

00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,690
primary G filtering is that the the

00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:30,070
input controls for the filtering columns

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,490
are customizable it's not always the

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,930
case

00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,850
sometimes you get like a very simple

00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,770
input control and like okay well what if

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,150
I wanted to be a slider what if I wanted

00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,840
to be a drop-down or if I want to be an

00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:43,450
autocomplete right so here you see a few

00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,930
different options there's you know an

00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:52,210
input a drop-down right this is the

00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:56,290
multi selection one okay this is just a

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:58,150
regular input regular input control and

00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:01,090
then there's a slider for the year okay

00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:03,190
and again all this works the way you

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:07,000
know pretty similarly right so what

00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:09,550
we're using for this is again a template

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,790
right so inside of the year we just

00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:19,180
throw in another ng template okay we use

00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:25,590
the P slider okay and we've got a

00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:25,590
property a model called year filter okay

00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:32,680
and basically you know you could put

00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,900
this in a probably a larger application

00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,840
you probably put this behind an actual

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,700
method but you can see that works right

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,640
basically you just call filter on the

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:46,030
data table and you're good to go pass in

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,650
the field and the match mode you're

00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:51,730
dealing with and the value that you want

00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:54,010
to filter on okay so basically just by

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,450
adding a template in binding the right

00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:58,540
way and then calling the filter method

00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:00,040
you basically can use any control you

00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:04,840
want to side of therefore the headers

00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:10,540
okay you can also do global filtering so

00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:15,640
you know I can feel like here alright so

00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:19,950
there's my global filter and basically

00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,690
you see that the global filter has a

00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,980
name here that's defined and then we

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,130
just reference it here as a global

00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,280
filter so

00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:34,370
like pretty much very easy to just wire

00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:36,410
these things up together all right so I

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:39,919
could go on more but that's that's the

00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:41,780
quick data table overview there's also

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,570
you know some very nice little panel

00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,720
components probably the most interesting

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:49,730
one in the applications I've worked on

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,490
would be the tab view right so you've

00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:56,240
got your your sort of standard tab

00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:59,320
component okay but also got some handy

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:04,700
little features you can close tab okay

00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:07,880
and also you can of course be notified

00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,440
of any particular event can also change

00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,390
the orientation you don't always want

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,340
your tabs on the top right or maybe you

00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,340
want that to be a user preference okay

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,860
and essentially all you need to do is

00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,039
clear your content inside of each tab

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:27,320
it's pretty straightforward the other

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,470
thing that you get with priming G is the

00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:33,260
grid CSS feature and this is just a

00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:35,120
simple fluid grid library but does use

00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,909
through out of all the prime ng demos

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,770
and it's really easy to use in your app

00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:42,559
so if you're not already using some sort

00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:47,090
of grid layout a library bridge CSS is

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:49,159
pretty easy to use there's nothing that

00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,809
says you have to use it though but it is

00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:54,679
it is just easy to use if you don't have

00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:56,630
something already so basically just by

00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,429
using a few different CSS selectors you

00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:02,780
can get you know a twelve column layout

00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:08,360
and you can also have it optimize and

00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:10,760
adjust responsively as well so like most

00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,169
of these grid libraries you just need to

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:16,330
learn a few different styles this is a

00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:20,150
four column six column etc okay

00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:22,549
so that's great CSS there's some other

00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,350
panel components as well I like the

00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:25,970
toolbar because you know a toolbar is a

00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,470
pretty easy thing to write on your own

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:30,350
you put a div a little bit of styling

00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,360
but it's nice to have just a very easy

00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:35,750
way to throw toolbar at the top of the

00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,159
page and with this you can do that and

00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,049
you can also do some

00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:41,749
adjustment in terms of where he wants

00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:43,159
the actual buttons to be on the page are

00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:46,929
inside the toolbar whether you want has

00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:46,929
been about left on the right etc etc

00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:56,179
alright so probably only other ones I

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:58,759
think I'll go over is tooltip which is

00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,679
of course handy right so you know these

00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:02,029
aren't all very complicated but the

00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:04,009
benefit is that you get kind of all of

00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:07,090
them together so they already do a lot

00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:10,399
of things that you might spend time on

00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:12,559
so basically just add this P tooltip

00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:13,849
directive and you can also do things

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:18,039
like set up the position whether you

00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:18,039
want to be top or bottom you Center etc

00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:23,779
but I logged is a good one because how

00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,749
many people are Britten a dialog

00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:29,389
component before yes you know this is

00:26:26,749 --> 00:26:31,580
why this is a good one now it may be

00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:33,830
possible that there's some dialog that

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,539
is you know super special for your

00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,460
application that no one else would ever

00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:39,080
write but a lot of times you just need a

00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:44,830
simple confirmation dialog that doesn't

00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:47,659
look like the browser dialog right so

00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,769
that all it gives you that and you know

00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:49,940
there's nothing really special about it

00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:54,799
except it just makes it really easy to

00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:57,590
do a dialog so if you look at the source

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,029
here this is the dialogue itself okay

00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,129
obviously you're going to want to have a

00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:03,769
sort of visible property to hide or show

00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:06,859
it right I'm you can make it modal or

00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:08,359
not and we'll talk about responsiveness

00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:09,529
a little bit later but every component

00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:15,049
pretty much allows you to make it

00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:20,029
responsive if you want to okay and then

00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:21,919
in the button here at the bottom we

00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:27,259
basically just change the display value

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:30,190
to false right very easy but also when

00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:33,499
you want to show the dialog

00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:35,809
you basically just set display to true

00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:42,049
and show it right so you get just very

00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:44,539
easy to use dialog thrown around there's

00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:46,249
also the confirmation dialog which is

00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:48,640
cool because it actually uses

00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:52,240
observables so you can actually

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:58,420
has a little more interactive so if you

00:27:52,240 --> 00:28:03,940
want to do a section yes okay so here

00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:06,130
the difference is that you know we still

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,600
have that we have the P confirm dialogue

00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,920
but here what we're doing is we're

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,840
basically just calling a method to

00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:16,090
execute the dialogue and you want to get

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:19,030
notified later right so if we look at

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:20,920
confirm one here basically we're going

00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,320
to a confirmation service and then what

00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,610
we want to do the confirmation service

00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:29,170
is basically a service provided by

00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:31,960
priming G which lets you fire off the

00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:33,610
confirmation dialogue okay and basically

00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,040
what we're saying is when they select it

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,360
that's when we do some work right so

00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,310
this handles the problem when you have

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,990
when you write a confirmation dialogue

00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:44,230
or some dialogue where you want to do

00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:45,850
some input based on the OP the operation

00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:57,040
but it's another callback that you have

00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:59,520
to write okay all right so it's going to

00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:02,050
jump ahead here there's a few other ones

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,670
this is one of the ones I've used on a

00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:06,220
project and passed called the mega menu

00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:07,990
which I like so if you have some

00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,060
application that has like tons and tons

00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,590
of operations and you know this is one

00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:14,230
of the situations where you know you

00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,460
fight with the stakeholder and say you

00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,810
don't need a menu that big there's

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,570
better ways to do navigation but they

00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:22,450
say no it has to be a huge menu so

00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:25,660
there's this lets you do that so so

00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:28,450
basically you can use this to display a

00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:32,310
complicated menu and all of the menu

00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:35,950
components use this menu model API okay

00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:37,480
which looks like this so basically

00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:41,020
anytime you have an item and then you

00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:43,810
just create a nested arrays of these

00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:45,550
objects with label and items you can go

00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:47,260
to D because you want to okay

00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,670
and it was licensed the menu model works

00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,710
with all the different menu components

00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:52,030
so if you decide that you know really

00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,620
the mega menu isn't the best choice

00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:57,300
let's try a different one you can just

00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,300
switch swap it out okay

00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:04,660
so this is another property one which in

00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:06,760
the slide menu which I become a lot more

00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,050
popular lately and again you can tell it

00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:14,290
uses the same model because it's

00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:16,330
hierarchical right so this is the

00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:19,710
initialization part I'm a slide menu

00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:22,630
again you just point into the model okay

00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:29,050
and that's pretty much it whether you

00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:33,360
want to get pop-up or not okay alright

00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:35,770
so one things um and I'm gonna move on

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,530
so I'm done through some of these

00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:41,740
components obviously there's more there

00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:45,490
are you know charts these are built on

00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,840
top of chart j/s okay so this is not the

00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,070
most extensive chart library in the

00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,850
world but it's a good start

00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:54,840
and so if you've got basic chart needs

00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:57,370
it'll it'll it'll work out well for you

00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,400
someone just says hey throw a line chart

00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,990
in the page you're good to go okay we

00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,000
talked about the messages it's also

00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,580
multimedia stuff there's a drag-and-drop

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:13,630
support there's also things like file

00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:16,540
upload stuff like that so let's actually

00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,740
work on the demo site actually this is

00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,300
local it's not going to work there's no

00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,280
server okay

00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,920
and there's some other little goodies in

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,150
here as well like a progress bar code

00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:29,380
highlighter which is used in all the

00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:32,080
demos things like that another thing I

00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,490
want to talk about in general now you've

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,350
gotten a good handle on sort of how the

00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:36,700
components work is responsiveness so

00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,710
this is one one of the things that's

00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,720
been based into these components from

00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:43,300
day one which is the idea of actually

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,920
being responsive so let's go back to the

00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:51,910
data table here and we'll pick the

00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:56,770
responsive one okay so you'll notice in

00:31:51,910 --> 00:32:00,010
the markup here we have responsive

00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:03,640
equals true okay so what this means is

00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:06,480
that now if we have to do in your

00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,480
resizing here

00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:27,270
okay we get some some good behavior so

00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:27,270
let me try going to smaller okay

00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:32,660
all right so now you see I'll make this

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,610
bigger so they can't guess I can we

00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:43,910
actually collapsed it you know to one

00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:45,800
single column okay all right and if I

00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:48,050
just make it a little bigger you can see

00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,790
to get the columns back you can also

00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:55,690
have more control like maybe dropping

00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:58,430
off one or two along the way as well and

00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,720
what's nice here is that you know this

00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:01,160
is pretty much true for all the

00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,010
components so you see now we've got this

00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:12,590
menu that's left here okay

00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:14,540
if we go into data list here this is

00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,460
going to change very much but basically

00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:21,230
they'll all give you some level of

00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:22,640
responsiveness which is pretty handy so

00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,200
this means that it's pretty easy to

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,910
write nap that's desktop app but also

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,650
look a decent on phone it's not going to

00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,060
be Cordova but it's going to give you an

00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,910
a good experience as well

00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:36,980
there also work well with touch in

00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:38,450
general all right so let's sort of a

00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:43,250
quick overview of the components

00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:46,820
themselves I also want to talk for a

00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:49,040
minute about theming okay so so

00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,450
basically one of the things I really

00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,250
like or one of things you pretty much

00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:56,750
need anytime you work with components is

00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:59,450
some some idea of a seat right in you

00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:01,610
know you may have designed a design team

00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,780
that has a theme in mind or you may just

00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:04,970
need to get something out of the box

00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:08,540
that looks halfway decent which is

00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:14,200
usually the case I'm in so so out of the

00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:17,990
box should get about 16 free themes and

00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:21,620
what's nice about them is that they have

00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:22,790
sort of the color separated from the

00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,399
structure so there's what we call

00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:30,260
structural CSS which is padding layout

00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:33,080
margins etc okay and then there is the

00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:35,149
skinning part okay so the structural CSS

00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,730
is usually sort of global initially if

00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:39,379
the priming G has defaults for the

00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,409
structural elements

00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:43,909
but some themes may override that okay

00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:45,919
but then when you're working with a

00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:46,970
prime energy application you also have a

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,099
better understanding of how it works

00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,809
some things are just going to be layout

00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:52,250
someone's going to be axe some things

00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:57,139
are actually going to be actual colors

00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:58,970
okay so the skinning of CSS because you

00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:02,900
color as borders background background

00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:04,730
images etc okay so let's take a quick

00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,759
look at this all the other thing is that

00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:11,059
there's font awesome included so I mean

00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:13,279
people are not familiar fun awesome okay

00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:14,839
see whenever you say not know like

00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:18,019
people don't raise their hand I've

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:21,619
noticed so so so congratulations for

00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:26,779
admitting but a fun optimist a library

00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:28,369
of cool icons you can use I should

00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:31,789
mention us before demo is that these are

00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:33,200
all built on theme roller so all the CSS

00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:34,579
selectors that are used are all built on

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,200
theme roller which makes it pretty easy

00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:46,339
to build your own custom theme as well

00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:48,170
okay so take a look at themes and I'll

00:35:46,339 --> 00:35:50,259
go back to the data tables because it

00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:53,660
has more stuff on it it's easier to show

00:35:50,259 --> 00:35:58,309
alright so for the most part the thing

00:35:53,660 --> 00:36:02,900
that you'll see when you change themes

00:35:58,309 --> 00:36:05,210
is going to be colors right so change

00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,950
the foot chain theme not too much

00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,930
changed here you know we saw that the

00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:14,210
header changed some are going to be more

00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:16,579
drastic pepper grinder and you this of

00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:19,400
course should be obvious here all right

00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:21,109
and as you see if you actually change

00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,789
themes dynamically which means that if

00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:24,680
you have that as a user preference you

00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:27,019
can actually have the user say okay this

00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,940
is my favorite theme cetera or what's

00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:30,529
they need to do branding so that slide

00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,500
your application has a certain theme for

00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:38,710
some clients versus others very easy to

00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:38,710
do that and if we take a look at the CSS

00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:57,310
all right it never looks that good we do

00:36:48,460 --> 00:37:00,910
it this big all right all right so if

00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:02,590
you look at let's say we just go down

00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:08,230
here and look at the data table all

00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:14,290
right okay so this is the P data table

00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:17,550
element okay

00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,550
if you look at the selectors here

00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:29,020
actually you get one set area so you see

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,840
they have UI data table and UI widget

00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:35,200
okay so every primary component has this

00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,640
UI widget selector okay so when you're

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,380
actually doing your own theming and your

00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,420
own styling you can have an idea about

00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,490
okay every eight your UI component has

00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:44,950
UI widget there are other CSS selectors

00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:51,220
that every class has every component has

00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:55,020
and in inside of the the demo it'll tell

00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:58,690
you what all the CSS selectors are okay

00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:00,790
so you can see here data list has UI

00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,320
data list etc etc okay

00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:04,619
so as you work more with these

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,330
components you get a handle on how the

00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:08,920
CSS selectors work which lets you

00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:11,230
understand better what things you can

00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,330
change and how to change them okay so

00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:17,380
for example I know that every component

00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:19,510
uses UI widget right so that means if I

00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:22,540
just go here and change the font size

00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:28,900
for UI widget and we turn off the mobile

00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:30,609
tools there to 2m whoa

00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,920
okay now everything's big right now

00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:36,700
would actually go across the component

00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:38,109
as well okay so and I can also change

00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,890
the global thought extent for exercise

00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:43,480
okay another nice going about the themes

00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:45,100
is although this is not a requirement

00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,900
for you if you develop your own custom

00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,710
theme with all the free ones that are

00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,460
included

00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:54,820
are all just using CSS MSDSs so they're

00:38:51,460 --> 00:39:00,849
all set so if you were to look at one of

00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:03,420
these let's look at I know I would look

00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:05,859
at a mega because that's a big one okay

00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:09,640
all right so we've got all the colors

00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:11,290
defined right and Omega is a little more

00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,560
complicated so it also has you know

00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:15,490
additional fonts that it uses and

00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,430
customization it makes - all sorts of

00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:19,839
different properties okay but you see

00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,070
this UI widget header this is going to

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,589
be used in many different components

00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,790
that use that selector not every you

00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:26,619
know it's not like there's a different

00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:30,180
header or CSS selector for every single

00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:32,880
component that has a header okay also

00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:37,780
the simpler things are really just

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,280
colors right so just by looking at this

00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,800
it's really easy to see how you could

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,500
build your own theme right you've got

00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,839
the colors and then the structural theme

00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:50,170
stuff is here so this is sort of the

00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:52,200
global selectors that are set so this

00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:55,180
goes also gives you an idea about how

00:39:52,200 --> 00:40:00,880
prime ng by default is associated with

00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:02,740
selectors with the theme colors okay all

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:10,240
right so it looks the the quick theme

00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:13,900
overview another thing I want to talk

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,570
about are the application template okay

00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:20,710
so far machine is very much an open

00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:22,960
source project you can get it from NPM

00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:25,089
very easily all the instructions are in

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,740
the prime in G showcase so it tells you

00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:29,380
how to get it from NPM so how to

00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:31,720
integrate it with your CLI if you want

00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:33,520
to but there's also some premium

00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,250
products which are the application

00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,780
templates and basically they just make

00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,099
it easier if you're building a whole app

00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:41,530
that you want to use the primary

00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:43,510
components you can actually get one of

00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:46,060
these templates and they just let you

00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:48,970
get started very easily they're fully

00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:51,670
integrated with angular CLI they're also

00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:55,990
touch us optimize the built with fast as

00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:57,820
well css3 html5 etc and they're the

00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:00,130
commercial license they're actually

00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,820
really cheap considering what you get if

00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,020
you

00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,670
it means you should go to the prime

00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,080
energy booths they're out there they

00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,630
tell you more about that I'll talk to

00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:11,040
you about the technical side so so

00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:16,150
basically what they give you is

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:18,310
something like this alright so you get

00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:24,340
sort of a nice little starter app right

00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:28,060
and essentially it's go to the start

00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:28,510
here ok there we go that's a little

00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,300
better

00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:32,200
ok so this just sort of an idea of how

00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,880
you can use all these components

00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:38,770
together and what that might look like

00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:40,390
ok and each one of the premium templates

00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:42,340
gives you a different thing which you

00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:44,950
know different attributes so like for

00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:46,930
example I'll show you another one which

00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:49,120
is using material design this one does

00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:51,280
not use as a flat design this is I think

00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:54,010
one of the key things about priming G is

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:57,430
that it's design language agnostic it

00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:58,810
doesn't care about you know the as the

00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:00,880
frame record doesn't care about whether

00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:02,290
you're using material design or you have

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,420
this awesome designer that insist on

00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:05,950
coming with something brand new it just

00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:08,380
provides you the tools to get what you

00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:10,000
need to do done ok so if the union is

00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,580
primary gene you decide well you know

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,170
your designer has a very specific way

00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,340
they might do things they don't want to

00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,390
use material design just because they

00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:20,500
don't want to look like Google which is

00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:23,740
not obvious reason then you can actually

00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,940
come up with your own theme and it looks

00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:29,230
completely different or you can try one

00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:32,350
of these ones as well ok so this is what

00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:34,270
the the template looks like out of the

00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:36,700
box it just none of stuff does anything

00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:39,100
alright it just gives you an idea of how

00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:42,160
you can put all this stuff together to

00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:46,060
look a certain way ok

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:51,250
and also it uses a lot of the different

00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:55,020
components ok the other thing is which

00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:57,910
is nice is that you can actually look at

00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:01,660
all the components using this particular

00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:03,130
theme so if you want to see ok how does

00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,960
everything look you know using this

00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:10,290
theme you have examples of everything

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,290
and how they work ok

00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:14,970
there's form examples with cetera you

00:43:13,529 --> 00:43:19,259
can see what they involve styling is

00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:20,579
like things like that also each of the

00:43:19,259 --> 00:43:22,440
templates actually comes with a whole

00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:24,809
bunch of themes so that the the

00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,999
templates give you more scaffolding than

00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:28,920
just a theme it's basically like a whole

00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:30,269
sort of application layout which you can

00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,579
customize however you want and then you

00:43:30,269 --> 00:43:34,799
can change colors using different themes

00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:37,529
so each of these templates has some

00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:43,410
different themes that you can use see

00:43:37,529 --> 00:43:47,390
the changes are somewhat subtle okay so

00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:50,819
on my machine here I have one of these

00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:55,470
themes this is the mega I'm sorry it's

00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:56,880
ultimate alright and so this is what you

00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:59,009
get you just get a simple project to

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:08,660
start with it supports the angler CLI on

00:43:59,009 --> 00:44:12,809
the box okay and you get a simple app

00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:15,869
and demonstrations with different views

00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:21,390
out of the box okay and so I'm just

00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:23,009
going to run one of these actually I

00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,539
think I'm are we running okay so you see

00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:30,150
our names you serve and now I'm running

00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:37,849
this premium template locally okay so

00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:37,849
this is the Ultima theme alright

00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:50,740
okay

00:44:51,270 --> 00:45:02,790
looks like my anybody didn't start the

00:44:53,550 --> 00:45:04,350
host looks like I seem to have inter

00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:09,770
broken I think you're broken my local

00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:09,770
and soft and I'll go to the Ryman g1i

00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:18,320
wait that was those of our one to go to

00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:18,320
all tomorrow

00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:28,730
okay alright so this is another one and

00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:31,070
you see it has a similar idea right just

00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:34,490
sort of a dashboard page a dashboard

00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:37,820
page to show you what's going on but

00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:41,390
also there are a few different things

00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:42,680
here there's one of the things I like

00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:44,930
about this one essence this one is

00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:48,560
actually a material design material

00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:50,180
design a theme you can see just by

00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,190
looking at the info controls but also

00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:58,160
they've imported all of the material

00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:59,570
design icon so all these are included

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,130
now obviously it's not hard to do that

00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:04,670
yourself but it's nice to have it just

00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:12,109
sort of be included and there's little

00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:14,780
things you can do like where is that you

00:46:12,109 --> 00:46:16,880
can change the size contact compact size

00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:20,869
you can change how you want the mem the

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:28,220
menus to behave okay where you went to

00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:31,040
the horizontal vertical you know little

00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:33,050
things in line profile etc okay and

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,730
again you know this would unless you

00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:43,010
have a lot of different colors as well

00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:46,940
okay and what what's cool is that the

00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:49,570
the the templates because they're you

00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:53,720
know it's actual sort of a starter app

00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:57,859
you know you get it and you actually if

00:46:53,720 --> 00:47:00,140
you look at the app module it has like

00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:02,090
every single prime ng component you

00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,500
could possibly want right you don't have

00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:06,490
to go add each one individually now

00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:10,790
granted you might want to remove some

00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:14,090
but they're all there and then of course

00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:15,500
you get examples of actually using all

00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:20,390
this stuff you also have a very simple

00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:22,670
header menu and footer right um and also

00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:25,250
you can didn't see an example of some

00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:27,260
additional custom components so the app

00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:29,270
menu component is specific to this

00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:32,330
particular theme and you can see sort of

00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:36,140
how it works and how it uses the Prime

00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:37,820
gee stuff inside of it okay the other

00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:40,160
thing that you get are a whole bunch of

00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:43,520
these just very simple sample pages so

00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,950
this is cool for if you're actually are

00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,050
starting a new project from scratch you

00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:52,130
can say it I have a login page

00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:53,420
woohoo so and I have seen people do this

00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:55,010
before it's like okay they start they

00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,690
start with all the sample pages up front

00:47:55,010 --> 00:48:03,980
and then of course they may customize

00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:06,830
them over time okay all right so that's

00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:10,010
the premium app template demo I just

00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:12,320
want to mention that they are giving

00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:15,170
away one of these themes at the prime

00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:18,530
enjoy you can get one at the end of the

00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:23,810
day right so so I encourage you to check

00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:24,770
that out and I'm trying to wrap up ten

00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:26,300
minutes before because I think there's

00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:32,050
another presentation starting right at

00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:32,050
3:00 so I brought it to give a question

00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:38,270
okay so the question is what about

00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,770
accessibility and this is definitely one

00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:41,840
of the key things that's gone into these

00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:44,720
components and that's largely because

00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:46,100
they often use and you know will

00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,520
basically prime tech us a lot of

00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:51,290
experience with governments so I've

00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,090
worked on projects before with you know

00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:56,390
working on a lot of accessibility issues

00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:58,760
with this team you know where I was

00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:00,680
you know consultant working for state

00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:03,620
government and we had requirements

00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:05,540
actually wrote tests for all these

00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:09,970
different accessibility features so a

00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:13,490
lot of us gone into the primary as well

00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:17,300
alright so last thing I want to say is

00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:19,430
that prime minis open source on a person

00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,020
open source if you're working for a big

00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:22,790
company or a small company that wants

00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:31,070
the premium support they can get it from

00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:32,540
prime ng and in the US I my company does

00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:36,440
training and consulting and that kind of

00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:37,820
stuff as well and this was going to put

00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,180
the slides until I realized they don't

00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:41,920
really say much so

00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:43,510
so I'm not bothering with the slides if

00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,369
you want it the best place to go is

00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:48,490
really you know go to the Prime enjoyed

00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:50,200
mo and take a look at that and fork the

00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:53,319
Prime in G repo and play with it that's

00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:56,440
the best way because it has has the

00:49:53,319 --> 00:49:57,910
sample has a showcase in there and you

00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:00,579
can play as a showcase you can look at

00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:02,380
it change it see how things work okay I

00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:08,140
think there's also a book coming out

00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:14,069
soon as well question does it have what

00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:16,839
support actually does it have it RTO

00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:18,460
something okay so yeah so the question

00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:20,859
was does they have RTL support and the

00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:26,349
answers some themes do so it depends on

00:50:20,859 --> 00:50:29,380
the theme if you want to ask me more

00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:32,619
questions I'll be in the the AMA ask me

00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:36,670
anything from 2:30 to 3:00 which is

00:50:32,619 --> 00:50:37,600
