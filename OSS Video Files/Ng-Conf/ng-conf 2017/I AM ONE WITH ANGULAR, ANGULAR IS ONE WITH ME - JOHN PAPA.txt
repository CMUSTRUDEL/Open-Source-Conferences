thank you thank you thank you thank you

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,599
cool all right good

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,809
I can hear myself that's a good thing

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,170
hey you guys having a good time so far

00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:14,910
Wow

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,350
this is one of my favorite events every

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,090
year to come suit because it's just so

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,760
much fun and they do a great job with

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,260
everything out there so I wanted to talk

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,420
to you today about one of my favorite

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,609
topics being able to code efficiently

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,890
and effectively with whatever tools that

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,140
you like to use so this is all about

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,800
being one with angular and angular is

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,960
one with me

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,420
because the right tools can make a huge

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,920
difference when you're coding if you use

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,930
the wrong tools that kind of consoling

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,219
it down now if you don't have the right

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,300
things things can be kind of complicated

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,129
in life right so what tools do I like to

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,530
use I like to use the angular CLI

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:55,410
angular's July is wicked awesome yeah

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,940
give it up give it up I like to use vs

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,039
code but any of your favorite editors

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,609
will work I like a quick fast editor

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,589
yeah vs codes awesome I love using

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,600
snippets anybody's ever seen me code and

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,420
you don't know I'm using snippets you're

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,950
like wow how Z code so fast

00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,510
snippets ROC anything you've got to do

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,010
over and over again absolutely use them

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,390
there's a new language service the

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,729
angular team has put out I think

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,799
yesterday oh that's freaking awesome

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,140
it's awesome I'm going to show you that

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,670
today because in the templates it helps

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,520
you see errors that you've got in the

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,170
HTML and then I like to build up web

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,820
servers but quite frankly I'm a

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,460
front-end developer I like to focus on

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,360
the UI so if I can spin up quick Web API

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,520
is in the backend

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,110
I like to use service functions so I

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,369
choose to use Azure there we're gonna

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,750
take a look how all these things can go

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,700
together build some really cool stuff

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,630
and when you do that it's pretty amazing

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,280
what you can do all by yourself so the

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,439
angular CLI makes everything really easy

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,060
which is nice and it might put us all

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,670
out of jobs pretty soon thank you very

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,200
much guys I'll just realize awesome it

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,420
does a lot of great stuff but it's more

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,729
than just creating code because anybody

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,070
can write code but writing it well and

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,259
following good practices that's really

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,549
hard sometimes maybe you want to follow

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,409
the angular style guide that we have up

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,420
in the docs the CLI is going to help you

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,150
there but first you need to learn how to

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,470
install the CLI thankfully just one

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,200
simple steps going to do that

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,750
so npm install grab it locally you've

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,540
got the CLI next you're off to the races

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,690
we might create a new app ng new as your

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,330
friend ng new create a new app easy to

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,570
go sticks it in that folder you can also

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,610
use my favorite flag dry run the dry run

00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,290
flag lets you practice how often do you

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,230
create something with a generator you're

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,370
like oh I didn't want those 892 files

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,350
it's kind of nice to know what's going

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,020
to create some times so the dry run

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,060
Flags your friend and then maybe at a

00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:48,150
place for npm install' taken like 180

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,830
days so you want to use skip install

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,410
it's great or sometimes generate the

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,920
code and later use NPM install or switch

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,140
to yarn to CLI supports both so what do

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,970
I like to do I like to roll with this

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,800
kind of a command I create a new app I

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,540
tell it on Scott I'm going to have

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,490
routing in there at some point very soon

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,470
so add the routing features right out of

00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,390
the gate because as we all know routing

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,250
is awesome but it takes a few things

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,410
that kind of hook it up the CLI does

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,120
that I also changed my prefix for my

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,180
components right away to whatever my

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,709
prefix is going to be maybe I want to

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,150
roll with sass I can set that up right

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,430
out of the gate as well and then I do

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,470
the dry run the dry run will show me

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,880
what are you going to create and I can

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,770
verify it's going to do what I'm

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,160
expecting it to do and then once it's

00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:35,670
happy I remove that dry run flag and

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,959
then I run it again so let's take a look

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:42,660
at kind of how this works

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:45,300
all right so we flip over to an empty

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:49,010
application what we could do is we could

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:51,540
bump up to running into a new folder and

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:54,180
I'll go to one coldplay every chef of

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,670
playtime folder so I create a new app

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,930
here I can call it my app and I can put

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,180
a bunch of flags in here maybe I want to

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,640
do routing in this application maybe I

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,190
want a prefix to be I don't know rogue

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,200
one maybe I want to do something else

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,300
like skipping installs or I want to do a

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,400
dry run to check it out so I can run dry

00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,739
run like this like say all right what's

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,420
that going to create now you'll notice

00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,580
it created things really fast but right

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,350
away tells me the top you specified dry

00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,660
run so you're not actually writing any

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,729
files that's why it's wicked fast it

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,990
shows you kind of what to look like see

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,220
the app routing module up there that's

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,990
it's going to create the app routing

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,729
module it's going to pull in the routing

00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,430
module into your application and get it

00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:35,530
ready to go so when it's time to run it

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,199
I can take that flag off if I want or I

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,610
can run it with skip install so we're

00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,160
running with skip install it'll generate

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,630
the application but won't run npm

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,810
install and then I can open up my

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,370
favorite code editor and then over NGS

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,169
code I look at the application you can

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,180
see I've got an app routing module I'd

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:54,490
have to add my own paths I've got my

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,470
base module here who doesn't love

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,500
setting up the renji module to route you

00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,060
know CLI sets it up for us and then it's

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,009
got all the karma and the end-to-end

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,930
testing and everything else out of the

00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:07,449
box that we want and if I want to change

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,360
any defaults I can hop into the angular

00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:12,430
CLI JSON file and in here for example

00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,590
for running like asp.net on the back end

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,330
or spring or something else and it

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,849
requires a different root folder for my

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,979
source code I can change these things so

00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:23,050
all this stuff is customizable inside

00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:25,150
this configuration file which is pretty

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,820
nice so you're not boxed into following

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,940
everything to the letter we do have some

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,580
control so let's say we have this app

00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,479
and I have another app already that's

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:41,500
NPM installed just to save time in life

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:45,190
let's close that oops hey that worked

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,990
CiCi's like extra code so over here

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,550
we've got a new editor and I've got a

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,479
little application and in my application

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,520
don't open that I have a bunch of files

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,780
and just to save a little bit of time I

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,530
added a few extra files to this

00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:03,630
application so this application here if

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:06,099
we jump back out to yep that's the one

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,330
we jump that out to here let's run this

00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,130
real quick first thing I'd like to do

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:13,330
when I get an app is I like to run ng

00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:15,039
serve o serve o means I'm going to build

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,289
my application and then I'm going to

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,240
open it in the browser so when I run

00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:21,370
this it's going to build the app it's

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,659
going to compile it and the ports

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,630
already in use that's always a good

00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:31,120
thing to check by the way let's do that

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:33,280
and maybe it's this one hey there is and

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,120
we'll go back

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,530
by the way you can specify different

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,120
port which is nice so it kind of tells

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,650
you that there so we build the

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,020
application it'll launch it in the

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,580
browser once it's ready to go and then

00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,590
we can flip back to terminal to kind of

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,810
see the progress it's building out any

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,759
chunks it's actually looking for any

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,070
lazy loaded modules for us which is cool

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,889
and then the application can launch and

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,690
run so that's cool but how do we build

00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:58,190
things up if we look back at our app

00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,389
we've got a bunch of empty folders in

00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:05,120
here we can delete some of those and

00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:07,280
inside of our application let's say we

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,990
wanted to add a bunch of features so our

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,370
apps still running I keep it running in

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,669
the background we're still running over

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,960
there I can refresh it just to make sure

00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:17,780
we go back into the code let's say want

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,160
to edit a navigation bar so since you

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,690
guys don't want to watch me type styles

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,530
I added a few styles of this app in

00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:28,729
advance and I can type in here ng

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:29,810
generates nav component nav and that'll

00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:33,110
generate a new component

00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:35,210
I'm extremely lazy my friend warbell

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:40,060
like to tell me no i'm efficient so i

00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:42,470
don't like to type that i type n GGC nav

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,419
and you see what it tells me up there

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,889
create those four files and we can

00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:47,900
customize that maybe you really don't

00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:50,330
like testing we can tell don't use specs

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,120
by default we can tell put the inline

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:55,849
styles for sass or for HTML and notice

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,940
that yellow line update app module what

00:07:55,849 --> 00:08:00,349
do you think that's doing yeah what do

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,840
we always forget to do when we create a

00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:05,840
new component declare it inside the

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,130
module alright so the CLI folks said hey

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,960
what would be really cool if we could

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,520
set that up for you so let's take a look

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,229
at what that did they come over here to

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,539
the nav bar it created a little

00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:17,210
navigation bar it gave us our component

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:18,949
template right out-of-the-box let's go

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:22,310
ahead and add a little bit of a nav bar

00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:26,060
to it this is where snippets really are

00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:28,220
nice go fast I type snippets are awesome

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,900
alright now that we have a nav bar don't

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,849
believe me I'm what it added notice the

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,000
declaration right there for the app

00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:36,830
component and then ask sweet now let's

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,020
go to the app component I don't really

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,060
want that title anymore let's go ahead

00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,120
and add a nav actually think it's go to

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,339
row and ask and we'll add that right

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,550
there and then once we add though is to

00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:49,610
go

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:52,760
back to our application and we refresh

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:55,459
there's our nap not too shabby huh

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,040
pretty easy to get out of the box up and

00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:59,089
running with side the application so

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,490
let's say we want to do some other stuff

00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:03,050
too so over here let's say we create and

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,940
create a list of rebels because we like

00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,709
rebels right we gotta have like Jenner

00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,990
or so and some other folks in there so

00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:10,760
you can GGC and we'll create a rebels

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,440
components alright is going to add that

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,450
component it's also going to declare it

00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,220
inside our module well I also like to

00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:18,740
create models for us I want to create a

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,760
rebel model it's like it's a ngg class

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:26,720
or CL for class and then I could say

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,089
rebel it's going to add that single file

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,040
with a class therefore called rebel

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:32,390
that's cool and maybe I want to create a

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,160
data service so I can go hit like an

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,910
azure function up on the web so it's the

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,160
ngg service or just s you catching a

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:43,190
trend here with the alias is pretty easy

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,930
it's kind of nice to do - data now with

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,019
services what is the thing we always

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:50,390
forget to do with services in angular

00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:51,709
yeah provide them so you have to provide

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,270
your services we always get that really

00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:55,760
cool error message inside the browser

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,709
that says hey you know I really like you

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,720
but you forgot to provide your service

00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:02,420
somewhere could you please go do that so

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,820
if I do this with a dry run flag - D is

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:08,570
a abbreviation for it it'll warn me and

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:11,329
say John and I'll say yeah CLI and see

00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:14,300
else that you forgot to provide it so

00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:17,959
now I can go back in there and say - M

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:19,070
please put it in the app module now

00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,959
notice what it's going to try to

00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,720
generate with the dry run there's a new

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,029
command at the bottom update app module

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,290
now is that cool or what we can add and

00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:29,290
provide services on the fly

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,190
so let's let it happen okay cool

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,390
the other cool thing is we look over at

00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,820
the get changes and we can see all the

00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,770
files we just generated all that stuff

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,090
out of the box ready to go we can look

00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,680
at what app module looks like it

00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,930
imported the files that we needed it

00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,850
declared the components it provided the

00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:51,290
services angular is so happy right now

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,940
alright so then we can go and we can

00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,380
write some code let's say I want to get

00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,110
a list of rebels I could create a

00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:59,150
constructor and what do our rebels need

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,030
let's say they need an ID

00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:05,390
everybody needs an ID right and we'll

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:09,980
create a public ID that's in the wrong

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:14,810
place there we go and then we can create

00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:16,550
a public name and let's give them a home

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:22,480
world because every rebel has to come

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:25,910
from somewhere and that will be a number

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,140
cool so once they get our rebel up there

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:32,120
then we want to go over to our rebels

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:37,120
component and again you get to watch me

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,300
type a lot of fun oops wrong one ro

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,360
rebels

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,280
I love snippets by the way if I told you

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,670
that yet now there's a lot of red stuff

00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,950
here why do you think that's red yeah

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:51,230
there's something wrong so this is all

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,730
red because the language services that

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,530
is an extension of es code are telling

00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,230
me I can't find those things in your

00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,330
components so we can go add those things

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:01,430
right so then go back to our component

00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,290
we can type in rebels TS go down to the

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,090
component and we could add all those

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,710
features now just to save a little bit

00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,210
of time here I'm going to go ahead and

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,470
whip over to a completed solution

00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,510
because we're kind of getting the sense

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,090
of how this is all going to play out so

00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:16,550
let's close that one down and close that

00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:18,470
terminate open a new terminal all this

00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,460
code is up on github by the way so you

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,550
can check it out we'll show you some

00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:25,130
examples later where to get that and

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:27,080
we'll open this up so here's the

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:29,390
completed solution in the end we'll have

00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,100
the app with rebels in there and inside

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,750
of our rebels you'll notice we're

00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,240
calling out to a service to go out to

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,610
Azure to get our data we can click in to

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,680
what the service does so that's really

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,190
cool by holding down the command key you

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,080
can navigate around the application

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,030
command pp to go back to the previous

00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,070
thing that you are on so you can toggle

00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,880
back and forth and you can even get

00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,680
intellisense

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,590
as you're typing in here which is really

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:58,620
nice so when we run this app now we say

00:12:53,590 --> 00:13:01,480
ng serve o or again I'm lazy ng serve o

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,120
like that it's going to compile the

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,160
application build it up and serve in the

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,440
browser now there's something really

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,510
interesting about this application with

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,870
angularjs I would argue that it's

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:16,690
extremely difficult to get lazy loading

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:19,930
to work lazy loading was not easy with

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:21,520
that with angular it's easy I mean like

00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,310
really easy and you're like sinking well

00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,320
it's easy like you know a weak or easy

00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:29,320
like a Sunday morning

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,680
well more like the latter so in this

00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,660
application the planet screen is lazy

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,250
loaded so when I click on planet it's

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,130
going to go across the wire let's go

00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,710
over to the network tab and zoom that in

00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:44,170
move that over we'll go to our all

00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,400
traffic will refresh real quick around

00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,620
the rebels there's all of our data

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,690
coming across when I click on planets

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,630
notice there's a new chunk coming across

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:55,510
the angular CLI automatically detected I

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:58,450
was using a lazy loaded route and it

00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:01,600
created a code split bundle and then

00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,460
loaded it on the fly like no effort on

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,360
my part whatsoever to do this that is

00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,360
awesome

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,680
[Applause]

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,600
you're thinking how does that work John

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,329
I'm like I'll tell you hold on

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,129
so right here we got an e Gurley loaded

00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:19,829
rebels component and then we've got a

00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:21,689
lazy loaded planets component we simply

00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:22,829
use the string syntax because we have to

00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:24,360
use a string because it can have a

00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:27,059
symbol with otherwise it would be

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,889
eagerly loaded so we simply do that and

00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,079
the angular CLI is going to detect this

00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:34,290
figure it out and then load it for us

00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,819
which is just wicked cool so what if you

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,379
forget how to write paths anybody ever

00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:41,160
here forget how to write the path and

00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:42,540
the syntax I do I forget everything so

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,949
let's say you wanted to write this too

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,529
we can use some snippets out of the box

00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:50,370
and one of those snippets is route

00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:52,319
default path I like that what if you

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:56,069
want to eagerly load it pass okay do a

00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:58,800
dash eager like that but really you do a

00:14:56,069 --> 00:15:00,689
dash eager there we go wrap path eager

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,999
it sets that up and I can set up a new

00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:04,769
path with some other component I can

00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:08,850
also set up a lazy component so I don't

00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:11,220
to worry about the syntax I'm faster

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:14,279
than the thing there we go so some other

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:17,160
route over here and I can put in app foo

00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:18,329
whatever it might name my module so it's

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,519
cool that these snippets is you don't

00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:22,019
remember all the syntax and these are

00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,269
free you can get these off of the vias

00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:25,920
code marketplace very very effective and

00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:28,079
everything you do with these snippets

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,809
they are all following the angular style

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,750
guide and the CLI is hand-in-hand with

00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:35,550
the style guide as well so all that

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,920
stuff kind of gets detected for you now

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,360
let's say you really like wet pack I

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,790
mean you're just uh you're Sean Larkin

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,709
you love wet pack see Sean Larkin this

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,250
week tell him how much you love it he's

00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,620
awesome

00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,059
he works on that team so let's say your

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,740
love and web pack and you're looking

00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:51,329
down here at your code and you don't see

00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,910
web pack but you know it's in there

00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:54,600
because John Papa told you so but you're

00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,629
like where is it

00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,079
well it's there there's an awesome

00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:02,279
awesome command in the CLI this is my

00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,470
favorite feature the sea line that's

00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,089
what won me over because sometimes you

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,860
build apps and you're like you know what

00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:09,179
I like what it's doing but I want to add

00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,639
one little tweak to the build process

00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:13,379
how do I get control that don't you hate

00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,019
when tools stop you from doing that

00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:18,870
seal Isis uh ah we ain't playing that

00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,690
game you can eject the best names

00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,089
command ever by the way

00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:27,470
I'm loving the visuals in my head right

00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:28,790
now you can eject from the web pack from

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,470
the CLI and it warns you and tells you

00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,509
what's going on so what this is doing

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,459
and I like the commitment changes first

00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:35,569
so I can show you what's happening it's

00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:37,850
saying look you're not gonna be able to

00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:39,649
run the build or the serve the way you

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,199
did before because you've just ejected

00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:44,420
the web pack stuff but we've given you

00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:46,279
NPM scripts that you can run that'll

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,980
still do the job so let's go look at

00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:50,689
what it actually did first inside the

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,129
JSON it did something really complicated

00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:56,870
it had a property saying you ejected

00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:59,060
then the package JSON it added those

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:02,089
scripts so you can learn how to okay not

00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:05,030
ng build it on your run NPM run build

00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:07,220
for web pack and then it added a bunch

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,230
of packages so all those dependencies

00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,079
were under the covers before now you can

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,730
see what those are and then you can have

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,390
a lot of fun with a third file it

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:19,390
changed it added in the web pack file oh

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,390
boy

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,650
so now I'll have Deb Kurata come up and

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,820
read every line see you and explain it

00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:32,110
by the way why did I do this with git

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:34,159
right so I could reverse when I'm done

00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,480
so what I did here not going to make

00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:37,370
this deck available to you all

00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,750
afterwards so you can see all the

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,370
commands that are in here because

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,590
there's just so many awesome commands

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,770
but I wanted to show you kind of a

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,120
summary of what happens throughout this

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:50,179
because the really cool thing about the

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,130
CLI is that it's not that it's taking

00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:54,620
your job right it's taking away the

00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,549
monotony of our jobs it's getting rid of

00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,289
the boilerplate

00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:59,900
and it's making it easier to work with

00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:02,330
and not only that but when I build has

00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,890
anybody here heard of IOT right we just

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,500
all heard of that right how can only ten

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:10,039
people raise their hand they were here

00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:12,200
for the last hour so I know I know it's

00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:13,460
the thing because Igor told me so äôt

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,809
right you want to learn how that works

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,220
you want to build it into your app you

00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:17,780
want to build your apps the most

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,330
optimized way possible

00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,370
the CLI just does it for you as angular

00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,919
gets faster and faster and faster the

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,049
CLI will evolve and do those things for

00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:29,330
you so you don't get left behind that's

00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:31,399
cool that's really cool we never had

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:34,580
this with angularjs angularjs there were

00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:38,179
like 800,000 seed projects right

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:40,100
which one are you using I don't know so

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:43,399
what's the ROI why should we use this

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,990
generate code fast and correctly we want

00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:46,940
to follow the style guide and deviate

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,740
where we need to efficient development

00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,750
of debugging experience helps us go

00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,390
through the process you can actually

00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,340
debug and end tests and debug unit tests

00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,529
with it as well it's an awesome build

00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,090
process we get testing right out of the

00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:01,010
box because the hard part about testing

00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,200
isn't running into writing tests it's

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:06,110
setting up the configuration and we get

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,539
an easy exit strategy or eject as they

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:11,179
call it which I love and when you do all

00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:12,559
these things it's great now I want to

00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:14,389
take one quick moment to thank to

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,970
angular CLI and the style guide cortines

00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:19,490
Hans Philippe's submit Mike Minko worden

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,860
Igor they are fantastic if you have a

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,630
problem CLI you just go up on github you

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,220
search the issues create a new one if

00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,040
you need to those guys are great quick

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:31,720
hand for them these guys are off

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:34,070
[Applause]

00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,720
this guy's awesome too and this is who

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,770
you could be if you use the CLI and if

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,660
you want to get in links any of the

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,550
stuff we talked about the CLI is up here

00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,560
the two different language services and

00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,450
these snippets they use you can get them

00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,010
up at this short link you can learn how

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,080
as your functions work by clicking on

00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:53,540
here and the source code for both the

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,940
app I showed and the Azure functions are

00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,830
up and github right now and by the way I

00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,470
could talk for like two hours and 26

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,450
minutes and 14 seconds about the CLI but

00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,190
I don't have time so if you want to hear

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:10,940
me do that you can check out my course

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:12,490
which came out today thank you very much

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:18,420
hope you have a great time stop

00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:18,420
