	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,099
yeah good afternoon everybody

00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:11,090
let's get started this presentation is

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:14,580
about two minutes and I am incredibly

00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:21,359
stressed out so let's just take a moment

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:23,340
and find our place of serenity you can

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,949
do some amazing things with JavaScript

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,930
these days in fact I would say that we

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,260
are on an entirely new plane of

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,350
existence but before I open up your

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,020
third-eye to unknown things a little

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,059
known fact that if you want to be on the

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,670
stage you have to sign a legally binding

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:45,450
contract to be entertaining

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,399
so I hedged my bets with music and this

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,149
is why you have my best friend Roger

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:54,090
here on keyboard duty because even

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,879
though I am enlightened I still have two

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,820
hands now Roger is not a programmer but

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,739
I think we can open up his mind in the

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,339
next couple minutes with all these

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:08,400
positive angular vibes in the room now

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,250
the first step to enlightenment is to

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,439
connect to a higher power and by higher

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:18,270
power I mean this keyboard I could do

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,780
this with a promise but because I'm

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,600
shiny I'm gonna become one with

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,030
observable and now you can see these

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,950
devices from another dimension stirring

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,950
down to communicate

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,080
and what's enlightenment comes knowledge

00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:40,170
the ability to know

00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:44,550
observables is my spiritual sure but yet

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:47,430
again telling me that everything is a

00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:50,700
string in life is so much better seen

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:54,990
through the lens of flatmap in an

00:01:50,700 --> 00:02:00,510
observable subject and so now you can

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:05,930
see data we are one step closer to

00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:10,590
knowing everything but with knowledge

00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:14,330
you must see defined understanding what

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:17,430
is this keyboard flying to tell me well

00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:21,930
with this observable double rainbow we

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:24,180
can use math to convert our raw data it

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:28,260
is something that makes sense in this

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,640
dimension and by that I mean music

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,420
though

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,670
[Music]

00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:35,970
[Applause]

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:39,070
but with knowledge and understanding

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,430
comes action with action we must

00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:44,590
manifest our destiny let us determine in

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:48,940
our hearts to be courageous and make

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:52,150
music together now tone Jas is

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:55,540
essentially the metaphysical crystal in

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:58,450
this equation allowing us to emanate

00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,500
feeling and vibrations into the

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:12,970
atmosphere which we can then capture and

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:13,840
harvest into but it's not enough to just

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,560
act

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,710
we must perceive the impact of our

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,170
actions we must ask the universe when we

00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:26,260
do something what is the impact what are

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:31,270
you trying to tell us so that we may

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:35,860
know what is truly in our soul and so to

00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:38,650
do this we will use the quarter j/s to

00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:42,670
capture a moment of time so that way we

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:45,640
may start to learn we'll also use wave

00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:52,770
surfer Jas to capture that same moment

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:52,770
of time that we may see here

00:03:53,490 --> 00:04:01,550
[Music]

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,160
until really connected everyone right

00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:08,810
now like for practically the same a

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:13,370
person now let's use this opportunity to

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:17,000
reflect on what is happening what we are

00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:18,980
doing we'll focus on a single breath and

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,860
by single breath I mean a single

00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,530
component as we use wait server yet

00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:28,150
again to capture an audio signal to not

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:40,560
only see but here

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:44,170
[Music]

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:50,110
yeah the clarity is stunning

00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:52,720
I hear you universe I hear you but now

00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,880
we're going to evolve into a new hash

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,020
for plain is we learn to project

00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,540
ourselves into multiple waveforms now

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:04,840
being students of component driven

00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:09,330
enlightenment we know that you could be

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,330
one component in many different places

00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:23,120
prepare for the harmonic risk

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:23,120
[Music]

00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:33,500
and now Roger since I've talked to you

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,990
angular everything that you know about

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,720
it why don't you share with me what

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:43,990
you've learned well I know what you want

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:46,550
me to say you're such a great teacher

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:48,560
angular is a reactive staff the space

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,480
JavaScript framework with a vibrant

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,280
ecosystem that integrates with powerful

00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,010
technologies like observables an

00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,760
electron but I think of our hearts would

00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,760
really want to say this

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,820
so attractive tool when I observe big

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:12,030
into your heart can help reaction to the

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:14,440
scenes I saw you

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,949
because I'm first

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,949
[Music]

00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:42,490
that's right

00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:46,590
now for the second verse

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:49,830
[Music]

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:51,700
I love the way way ahead of time

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:56,040
IOT

00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,040
I say a plaque see justice

00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,440
to see

00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,610
[Music]

00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:13,109
baby

00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,819
[Music]

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:25,350
I'm out ain't no doubt all about that

00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,640
and you learn

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,330
[Applause]

00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,430
[Music]

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:36,230
[Applause]

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:42,850
after the keynote semantics but I know

00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:44,460
you're my romances change all the time

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,000
so progress

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,940
[Music]

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:56,840
bwa

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:57,010
