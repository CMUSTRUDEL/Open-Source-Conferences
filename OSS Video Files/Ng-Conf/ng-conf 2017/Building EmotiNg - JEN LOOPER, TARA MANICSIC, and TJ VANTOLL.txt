Massachusetts and she was nice enough to

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,170
make me a try to clearly pronounce

00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:27,119

TJ van tol and TJ is a former member of

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,770
the jQuery core team he's an

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,550
unbelievable dancer he's going to do a

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,100
demo at the booth later on and which

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,680
slide TJ you might remember from last

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,780
year you might remember from last year

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,399
we had these fabulous outfits and we did

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,329
a cooking show so we're not going to do

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,219
that today we're going to do something

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,940
completely different yeah the last

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:03,210
member of our team is a Tara Tara we

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,830
found wandering wandering and fun Tara

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,439
likes tacos I like actually she's a

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,229
pretty big fan Tara also a big fan of

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,810
emoji and as you maybe maybe you were

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,390
able to tell kind of all really big fans

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,799
of emoji up here and somehow even though

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,070
we're still not exactly sure how it

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,189
happened over a series of conversations

00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:26,580
and chat our shared love of emoji turned

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:29,250
into these amazing outfits that you see

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,799
us wearing today yeah re has never been

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,119
more proud yes our album drops next week

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,250
so you'll make sure you want to make

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,810
sure to check that out and for those of

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,390
you that are judging us Tara do you see

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,899
them yeah I see you're judging us right

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,310
now I am totally judging my eight dollar

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,380
walmart sweatpants that I'm wearing

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,119
right now excuse me this is ten dollars

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,310
ever cromby from Poshmark you guys know

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,110
you ladies know for those of you who are

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,750
you probably haven't spent hours of your

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,729
life googling for the term emoji costume

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,659
you don't know you know because let me

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:02,130
tell you we have we have we did and I'll

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,079
just say if you think these outfits are

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,680
ridiculous that things could have been

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,789
quite a bit worse I really wanted that

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,069
one yeah I lobbied couldn't

00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:14,349
I was overruled but believe it or not we

00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:16,930
did actually build something you have

00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:19,959
yeah and Jen you want to tell them about

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:25,500
what we built we built the world's first

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:29,079
and only emoji as a service polling and

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,780
mobile and web polling app with sounds

00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:34,390
and colors and is called emoting Emmy

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,310
and you should feel free to pop up in

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,290
your browser on your phone and visit it

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,840
while we're talking so emoting Emmy

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,510
emoting me and we actually came up with

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,700
this idea because like probably a lot of

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:49,840
you we slack a lot and we wanted a way

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:52,090
to vote on things but we decided we

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,980
would take an emoji and assign this is

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,980
something we wanted to vote on and then

00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:00,700
use that emoji to make a vote so emoji

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,950
vote emo and then we realized as you

00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,720
know emojis kind of convey enough

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:08,379
emotion in themselves like that's what

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,709
we have them for so imagine a really

00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:14,229
succinct way to show how you feel about

00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,989
your new company logo by simply clicking

00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:20,049
the poop emoji I mean it makes it that

00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:23,139
simple yeah Sri fund oh yeah so we

00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:25,930
created the app to do just that but you

00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:28,030
may be asking yourself why do I need a

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,260
real-time app what's the point of all

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,650
this can't you just refresh the screen

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,949
what about ajax ajax was nice TJ explain

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,930
please now we built emoting for two main

00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:40,479
reasons really the first was we wanted

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,190
to justify building an emoji angular up

00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,659
at work for the last handful of weeks I

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,729
think you can all agree that that's a

00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:47,530
pretty cool idea but the second is we

00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:49,900
wanted to show really how easy it is now

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,269
to build apps that work in real time and

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,370
by the terms are real time really all we

00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:56,590
mean is apps that have data that refresh

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,209
without the user having to take any sort

00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,919
of explicit action they don't have to

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:01,569
hit the refresh button if you saw the

00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,430
emoting app earlier you notice how our

00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:05,260
charts and graphs sort of automatically

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,579
redraw themselves as boats come in

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,159
without you know the user having to

00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,870
actually do anything in particular now

00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,729
this is important because this sort of

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,620
behavior is increasingly becoming an

00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:16,509
expectation of the apps we build and

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,880
it's becoming that way because there's a

00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:21,099
lot of asset just do this right now you

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,090
probably don't have to think too hard to

00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:24,800
think of apps that you use in your data

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:28,160
a work that have some of these real-time

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,290
aspects to them one that we use a lot is

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,630
Dropbox I've always thought it's really

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:35,000
cool that on dropbox if i upload a file

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,370
to my dropbox folder on my mac how that

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,310
file immediately peers in dropbox is web

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:43,130
interface another one that we use a lot

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,930
is slack and as you can see we're pretty

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:47,060
big fans of slack and what makes flak

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,800
really cool is that as you type in

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,410
messages those messages immediately

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,240
appear across slacks multiple

00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,460
environments across the web across its

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,560
native apps and across its desktop apps

00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,090
as well and just to be clear like this

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,770
is this is how we talk to each other

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,520
this is pretty money progress over all

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,930
right here yes but the problem is I

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,700
think most people in here would agree

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,740
that building apps that work this way is

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,090
pretty cool and fairly important but

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,490
traditionally building these things have

00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,350
been has been really kind of hard I mean

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,479
I know I have some personal experience

00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,220
trying to implement sort of a that sort

00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,840
of thing on a smaller scale right but

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,229
this is a few years ago so i was using

00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,850
things like jquery templates and what

00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:27,260
else it was some long polling a server

00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,229
pretty proud of that one and somebody

00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,450
find that really great architecture

00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:36,650
needless to say didn't work out the

00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:38,240
greatest but the thing is you know even

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,130
for those of you that are thinking right

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,090
now maybe you've built something like

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,650
flack you know maybe you have some

00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,630
experience building apps that work that

00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,060
way remember that it's also increasingly

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,650
a user expectation that your apps sync

00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,110
in real time across the web and native

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,760
apps as well if you think of the slack

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,139
example for instance one of the things

00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,940
that makes flag so great in one of the

00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,919
reasons we love slack is because it

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:01,940
works so well not only on the web but on

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,320
slacks ios and android apps as well now

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,210
the good news is we have better tools

00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,479
than jquery templates and long polling

00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:10,340
nowadays and really know building

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,470
real-time apps is now you know

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,570
considerably easier we have angular of

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,729
course the reason that we're all here we

00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,639
have we have nato scripts for building

00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:21,289
and android at angular apps on iOS and

00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,260
Android and we have firebase for

00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:26,690
enabling this sort of real-time data ask

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,099
access part of these sorts of x so we

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,020
talked earlier about how a moaning is

00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:32,060
both a web and a native app and we're

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,590
going to tackle each of those in turn so

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,620
we're going to talk about the native

00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,240
first and then move

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,380
to the web and when it comes to native

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,910
apps there's pretty much no one you'd

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,949
rather hear from than our own gen

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,500
loopers here Jen how many apps have you

00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:48,870
deployed to the app stores it's about 20

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:51,330
and i have a problem jen jen dimension

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,860
some good-ass agendas also work

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,780
firsthand on our NATO script firebase

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,370
integration so Jen I'm going to pass the

00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,350
baton to you why don't you tell people a

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:01,880
little bit more about emoting native all

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:04,889
right so when I say mobile apps you say

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,600
mobile apps made a trip this is that's

00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:09,840
what I'm talking about so why would you

00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,389
go ahead and build a mobile app well for

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,250
the first thing we can go ahead and use

00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:15,930
these native modules to collect images

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,610
well that's pretty simple but think what

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,280
we could have done we could have used

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:23,250
something like this new face twisting

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,620
emoji photo editor thing that just came

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,510
out on iOS I have to try this time we

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,979
can use this a face swapping you know I

00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,919
just paste wiped with NATO script caps

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:33,300
so FYI that was fun we could have done

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,330
something like these snapchat filters

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,100
that was that that was a possible EDC TJ

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,960
doesn't have a soul so you didn't get

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,849
the flowers yeah what are you going to

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,610
do it just makes you look crazy anyway

00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:46,229
point being with native the sky's the

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:50,130
limit and native script can help you

00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:52,950
make that happen so to get started I

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:56,669
went ahead and opened up my trusty yeah

00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:59,940
my trusty command line and just typed in

00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:01,740
pns create emoting dash dash MGT NS

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,139
telerik native script create a new app

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,539
and the ng flag helps me create an

00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:09,419
angular mobile app with native script

00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:12,000
then I pop open using my favorite editor

00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:13,560
Visual Studio code and start coding and

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,320
because NATO script allows us to use

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:21,690
live sync we can go ahead and we can go

00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,479
ahead and start refreshing the native

00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,310
emulator in real time across across

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,380
platform so that's genymotion and then

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,610
my iOS emulator live thinking live

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,110
sinking and you can go ahead and update

00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,880
using this native script tooling which

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,800
is really nice for building your native

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,320
mobile app I guess I should point it

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:42,539
that way Tara but the magic in the

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,820
background is actually observables so

00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,959
what we have is this beautiful support

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,430
that we have in a descrip for our

00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,380
angular observables of course they're

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,780
very very useful and angular as well so

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,520
all I have to do is I a set of a watcher

00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,320
with my with my observable and I gather

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,690
the data into my app using this

00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,550
observable and using the firebase plugin

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:08,790
I go ahead and I'm missing a slide I

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:10,200
think I am there you go because we just

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,760
talked about firebase plugins but i just

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,650
want to mention that once you create

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,540
your app in the firebase you need to

00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,829
integrate the firebase plugin by our

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,500
favorite plugin master Eddie for

00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:21,839
bragging and the new initialize firebase

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,150
in the native script app and then you

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,430
leverage your observables so gather the

00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,470
data with your observables and use the

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,600
firebase plug in to add this value event

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,250
listeners so that you're watching in

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,200
real-time for data to come into your app

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,850
so that you can refresh in your native

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,220
app and that's a uiimage refreshing

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,900
that's not a webview FYI you can see

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,930
here in firebase we're refreshing and we

00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,490
see it right there and then my favorite

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,560
part we get to start the plug-in party

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,110
and I'm the kind of designer that I

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,360
cannot leave a pixel untouched so I love

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,959
lots of gradient lots of things popping

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:58,620
up you can say this is MOT yes again yes

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,970
ami under percent me so we have several

00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,620
plugins that make the native experience

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,050
a little bit even a little bit more

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,410
smooth we have the fancy alert plug-in

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:09,150
that allows the a little alert to pop up

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,040
in a beautiful fashion cross-platform

00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,560
and all of these are communities source

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,779
to plugins we have a loader so that we

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,390
can seize like Igor the loading

00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:20,130
indicator and then we have a little

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,470
toast pop up and I also have some sounds

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,640
in my native mobile app and I'll demo

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,680
those later for the voting you're going

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,470
to love it okay so enough with the

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,300
plugins congratulations with only one

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:34,110
glitch you just built a real-time mobile

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:36,120
app oh yay um no we have our images

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,680
gathered into our application we have

00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,420
them stored in firebase what are we

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,829
going to do with them Tara we're going

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,060
to show them on the web and we're going

00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:45,000
to be able to vote on the web with some

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:48,360
beautiful charts Thank You Jen so some

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,699
of you may be asking you know Jen gave

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,579
us a really good reason of why we want

00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:56,430
the native mobile app so then why do we

00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:58,150
want an web application this is my pear

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:01,880
programmer

00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:04,490
so there are a lot of reasons to make a

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,740
web application and a few of them are

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,120
you know people maybe just so wrapped up

00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,260
and what they're doing on their computer

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,170
that they don't want to pull their phone

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:14,270
out or maybe they're just too lazy to

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,700
even find their phone I mean let's be

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,020
honest people have a button in their

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,850
restroom where when they run out of

00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,740
toilet paper they press it and it shows

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,680
up on the door set the next day it's

00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,740
country really lazy yeah but more

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,830
importantly why be exclusive why only

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,050
give our users one way to emote we have

00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:36,110
the ability we have the technology to

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:39,230
make an application that can sink in

00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,940
real time both what you're doing on the

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,090
mobile what your users are doing mobile

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:46,490
wise and what we're doing on the web so

00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:49,610
one of the things that Jen and TJ both

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,500
talked about is that we use firebase so

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,380
for the web application we used

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,840
angularfire to module and it's really

00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,450
easy to implement it you do an NPM

00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,980
install you put your configurations in

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,600
and then you implement it in your

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:07,520
application and angularfire to module is

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,830
observable base using our xjs and

00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,480
angular and firebase and it also does

00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:15,050
real-time binding so with everything

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:18,230
that we needed and actually want more so

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:20,030
with this application we use the angular

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,010
CLI to create the project we use

00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:24,170
firebase to get and put our data and

00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,090
then we use kendo UI to do the

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,760
visualizations and the charting and that

00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:31,790
made building a real time application

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,100
such quick work oh it's really nice so

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,900
as you all probably know with the

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,420
English COI when you create a project

00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:43,430
it's built with you know under a minute

00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:47,060
and then with the kendo UI charts we

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:51,810
made chart from the ground up so unlike

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:57,060
ng-conf 2017 there's no funny wrappers

00:12:51,810 --> 00:13:01,529
yes nailed it good all right good area

00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:03,390
but also since you're using actual true

00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:05,340
angular components everything that you

00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,560
use an angular to optimize your

00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,210
application you get right out of the box

00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,570
so you're getting a ot you're getting

00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:15,839
tree shaking immediately and with

00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:18,420
firebase or with the angular fire to

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,460
module this was the line of code we use

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,680
to get our data to do the visualizations

00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,120
that's all we needed to do to bring or

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,610
the only line of code to bring in our

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,860
information pretty pretty succinct it's

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:32,130
really nice and then in our template

00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:35,610
this is where we're putting in the

00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:37,800
angular or the kendo UI chart so it's

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,330
just a few lines to put this in and get

00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,910
our data going and you'll see these

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,500
visualizations now I want to just take

00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,610
this time to like really dig into the

00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,950
code you know we're going to get some

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,839
live coding and we'll do take a look at

00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,060
all the code that it took to get that

00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,880
data to refresh our charts and rebuild

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,370
our charts carretera this yes six

00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:01,710
minutes left it's a 60-minute talk what

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:04,350
twice o.o ty yeah so this is all you

00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:06,960
need with our eyes yeah you're basically

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,610
getting your charts refreshing as a new

00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,070
data comes in so you see over here on

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,860
the left this is the instance where

00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:15,630
we're going in and we're emoting and as

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,720
soon as you remote you could see that

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:21,360
eventually that the firebase database

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,610
will update that data and as soon as

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,130
that data is updated it goes to our

00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,230
instance on the right and puts that data

00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:31,080
into that other instance and shows it on

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:34,100
these graphs so I think with that we

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,630
should give it a try it's pretty awesome

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:39,660
if you want to go ahead and head over to

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,910
a moding gut and eat on your laptop or

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:45,089
yes on your laptop or on your phone go

00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:46,890
to your browser yeah and Jen's gonna set

00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:48,990
up for our demo here and while you're

00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,010
visiting and moding that means Jen we

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,110
don't want to put that domain name to

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,870
waste and how much was at $12 domain

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,190
name it was 1199 so Jen got a pretty

00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,810
good deal but we still don't want to put

00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:59,370
that money to waste so go ahead and load

00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,200
it up and while James getting ready

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,390
there's two things that we want to let

00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,590
you know about here so we have the

00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,420
mobile app here and

00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,790
admin app where you can upload the

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,250
pictures we didn't give you the ability

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,830
to upload the pictures because I mean we

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:16,710
really like you we just don't trust you

00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:19,260
yet and I think the conference

00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,000
organizers would be okay with our

00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,430
decision to not allow you to upload

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,820
arbitrary images onto the big screen I

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:28,440
know why I don't know why the other

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,780
thing is that you know although we've

00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,520
tested this pretty thoroughly right we

00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,260
did not get the opportunity to test this

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,240
with two thousand of our closest friends

00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,860
I mean I do have a lot of Facebook

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,660
friends you know just going to say but

00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,820
the logistics of you know getting them

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,890
all together I didn't have you know it

00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,570
takes quite a bit of time so you know

00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,460
cross your fingers for us we're hoping

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,600
for the best and general set you want to

00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,480
tell people what they're seeing up here

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,160
okay so what you're seeing here is the

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,380
web app here which you can look at on

00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,600
your on your devices and start the

00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,420
voting and then over here we have my

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,890
native emulator for iOS showing the app

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,650
in real time now if everything goes well

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,330
mal con plastic we're going to have me

00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,310
taking a picture and loading it into the

00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,680
mobile at the mobile app you're going to

00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:13,680
see this appear in real time in the

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,700
simulator and in on the web and then

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,440
you're going to be able to go ahead and

00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,090
vote so are you ready well we're gonna

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,340
we're going to have all of you do the

00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:23,730
wave for this picture you all know the

00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:26,850
wave right there's no how to stand up

00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,590
and sit down yeah so we have a lot of

00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,630
confidence in your physical ability to

00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,520
put the computers aside before it's just

00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,650
and just to make it clear we got to let

00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,930
people know this if the wave is not very

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,630
good and this demo fails we get on you

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,670
yeah yeah right chillin we're expecting

00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,590
for dissipation from everyone so I'm

00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,990
going to start it off on this end and

00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,760
I'm looking at my last everyone's right

00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,850
the far end of the room I'm going to do

00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,940
a countdown of a 321 to get this started

00:16:50,850 --> 00:17:02,000
so is everybody ready ready how so

00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:05,780
confident already three two one oh I

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,780
think I got it Oh

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,660
I'm kidding with that so and there's the

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,910
picture see coming in and you can start

00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,610
voting on that hold it on your screens

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,970
as well oh so just to let you know that

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:21,939
I really what we think it sounds was

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:28,089
going pretty we're not fans of ourselves

00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:30,190
apparently right now oh you haters all

00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,930
right okay good I'm proud of all of you

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,410
that was a beautiful away excellent

00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,550
works so the key takeaway here it's by

00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,559
the way it's really hard to stand up

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,990
here and make a serious point just sort

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,910
of like this but but the key takeaway

00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,770
here is you know all those dev is kind

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,200
of silly right like this this is a bit

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,730
of a contrived example it's pretty cool

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,230
that you can build this right I mean you

00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,720
saw Tara explaining the architecture of

00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,580
the web app Jen explain the context or

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,809
the architecture of the native app and

00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,730
these are tools that you're already

00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:00,070
familiar with right you've been learning

00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,690
about things like angular like native

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:04,840
script for iOS and Android apps and

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:07,360
firebase at this conference so these are

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,850
things that you can build and previously

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,470
that would have been really hard right I

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:15,220
mean a few years ago you would have been

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,960
dealing with raw web sockets and scaling

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,340
issues and then who even knows what's

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,510
how in the world you would do this on

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:24,570
iOS and Android but today but today it's

00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:28,179
as easy as using tools you already know

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:33,700
jen is out of control here started it's

00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:35,440
like if exercise 5gen so basically what

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,420
I'm trying to say is with things like

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,370
angular with native scripts with

00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,750
firebase building real-time apps is now

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,480
really easy and something that you can

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,590
add to your own applications and so with

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,059
that I think we all have one last

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,160
takeaway we're going to end with Jen you

00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:50,080
want to kick us off oh yes so just to

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,030
reiterate if you want to build a native

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,309
mobile app for iOS and Android using

00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,350
javascript or angular you might want to

00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:58,240
take a look at NATO script org and NATO

00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,559
script as we know is the bomb com and

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,940
I'm literally the only one in this room

00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:05,710
who is old enough to say that the

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:07,510
certificate access and kendo UI really

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,030
helps you build your angular

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,220
applications to be more robust with like

00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:14,679
our grids and our charts that are true

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,050
angular component made from the ground

00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:18,210
up and obviously the best way for me to

00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:21,800
visualize

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:25,470
that was with a 3d spinning disco taco

00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:27,120
check it out if you want to talk anymore

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,830
about anything you saw today if you want

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,940
to talk about native scripts or kendo UI

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:34,200
or emoji you know we're at the booth the

00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,210
progress booth right outside the door

00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,750
come by and check we're very nice I

00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:46,140
swear thank you so very much

00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:46,140
