00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:20,520
hello my name is ELISA Michael and I am

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,970
making a video to get some feedback for

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,880
my mainstage talk at ng-conf or 2017 the

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,429
title of my talk is giving bootstrap as

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,109
a boot I know this year especially

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,850
they're being super conscious about not

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,890
being negative and I mean the entire

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,660
title of my talk right giving bootstrap

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,160
the boot as witty as it is it is

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,200
negative and do you want to talk about

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,730
how I could possibly approach the

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,370
subject of convincing people that

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,989
bootstrap isn't the optimal thing you

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,030
want to use while at the same time not

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,829
being negative about it if we get real

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,570
honest there is no positive way to say

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,739
stop using that not really sure what to

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,090
do with it I'm just gonna do my absolute

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,800
best and hopefully that people won't

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,980
like throw things at me while I'm on

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,500
stage so I've been a full-time developer

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,170
for a year now and I work um as my day

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,360
job and I have a ton of side projects so

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,939
through all of these there's been a

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,520
common theme in a common pain point of

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:16,290
bootstrap and if you haven't actually

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,720
experienced the pain of bootstrap I

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,400
can't give that to you I can't fully

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,220
make you understand but I'm gonna do my

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,500
best to paint a picture of the pains of

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,630
bootstrap so the second selector is just

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,009
override the wonderful bootstrap so this

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,810
select right here there are a lot of

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,000
times that because bootstrap is so

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,299
specific that you have to one-up it in

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,540
specificity and this isn't the reusable

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,700
way to do CSS right this is very painful

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,439
and very specific and it's going to be a

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,200
pain to then go and iterate on and

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,790
change in the future um and so it's just

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,409
kind of like adding on more and more

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,479
complexity and more and more specificity

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,180
as you go throughout the lifetime of

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,680
your project super-important specific

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,000
selectors I'm scrolling through and I'm

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,610
probably gonna be making a face on stage

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,439
like this and I'm gonna like check my

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,090
watch alright and then like oh my

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,860
goodness this taken forever right and we

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,090
zoom in and we see that all of these

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,030
important tags that we were just

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:13,180
scrolling through is actually bootstrap

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:17,700
by default 66 important tags there

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:21,700
being as specific as they possibly can

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,650
by default sixty-six times I pulled up

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,299
this like Stack Overflow article hey

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,189
here's a guy he's wondering how to like

00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:28,900
make specificity work he's using

00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:30,280
bootstrap and he's trying to override it

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,470
it's not working and of course the

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,209
number one voted thing on there the

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,810
number one answer was have you tried

00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,680
adding important to all of the lines at

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,959
the end of the day people get frustrated

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,549
and this is their only answer I'm ending

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,109
with a quote from the Stack Overflow guy

00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:46,209
typically not the best way to do this

00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:49,180
but I think it should work and that

00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:51,989
really sums up the story of living with

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,909
bootstrap and trying to work alongside

00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:56,379
bootstrap right week it's it's not the

00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:58,180
best way to do it it's not going to be

00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:59,829
future like scalable and thinking about

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,120
everything and how you want your library

00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:02,859
to work and it's not gonna be really

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,829
understandable for future team members

00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:17,440
you jump on but it should work right

00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:20,980
sure we can important all the things I

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,680
feel like I owe it to bootstrap to be

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:27,930
able to say face to face that when it

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:32,319
first came out it did have its uses but

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:34,150
this idea this attitude of typically you

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,049
know this isn't the best way to do this

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:40,930
but it should work we can do better

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:43,870
right we we can do better than it should

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,629
work this should get us through so what

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,510
does that look like I have two options

00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:53,340
for you to offer up today the first is

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,340
to completely remove bootstrap

00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,830
thank you thank you I actually within G

00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,599
doc I got pulled on Joe Eames was like

00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,580
hey I hear you're giving a talk about

00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,379
removing bootstrap I have an app that

00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:10,069
needs bootstrap removed and I was like

00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:12,080
I'm your girl so I did remove bootstrap

00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:14,269
from that project but many of you might

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,250
be thinking I work on a really big app

00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:17,889
it's been in production for years

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,959
there's not time money resources

00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:23,330
permission autonomy to actually remove

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,970
bootstrap so those of you probably the

00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,970
majority I offer option number to

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:37,190
completely remove bootstrap nicely what

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:40,070
does that mean one component at a time

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,320
so think to yourself the next time you

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:45,220
need to refactor something the next time

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,229
that you get tasked with a new feature

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,930
challenge yourself to do that one

00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:53,030
component that one feature sans

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,060
bootstrap right don't use their

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,550
selectors get out that custom style I

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,160
know this can be scary I've been told

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,560
this can be scary even though you all

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,070
are brilliant developers right and like

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,260
making the button look good is scary but

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,870
but I want to give you something to hold

00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:15,229
on to because I do styling all the time

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,860
and I still to this day look things up

00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:17,419
right

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,400
we're not computers that can memorize

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:21,229
everything so if you want to challenge

00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,960
yourself you want to remove bootstrap

00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:24,350
and give it the boot CSS tricks by Chris

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,970
coiour

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,650
anybody heard of Chris coy or see you

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,630
sister to me yeah we got some people in

00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,240
the audience I know all right Oh amazing

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,700
absolute best he's got an almanac he's

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,280
got tons of articles and how to's and

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,530
best of all most of them end with a code

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,169
pin with like the actual code so you can

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:45,860
be like whoohoo right so here's a

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:48,860
resource that you can hold on to but

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,960
typically it's not the best way to do

00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,580
this but I think it should work this

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,910
boots strappy attitude

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:58,729
it just it can't remain we can't allow

00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,410
it to continue and I love what

00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:03,830
hard-boiled web design had to say about

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:07,280
it the worst that we as the current

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,990
custodians of the web can do is to allow

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,800
any

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:14,620
to limit what's possible and that's what

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,789
bulky libraries like bootstrap there are

00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:22,030
others they do their themes they cut out

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:25,509
all the creativity all of the artists

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:28,690
like artistry right you just plug it and

00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:31,240
chug it you keep going so I want to

00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,620
challenge you all to give bootstrap the

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,160
boot even if it's just one component

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:38,020
because there is nothing to fear and

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,210
everything to gain by writing your own

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,580
styles from scratch thank you all so

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:47,730
much for having me

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:47,730
