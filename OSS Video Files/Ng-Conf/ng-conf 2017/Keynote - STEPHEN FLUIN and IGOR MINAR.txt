hello everybody good morning how is

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:15,719
everybody doing everybody's excited and

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,340
recons is about to start and this is

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,189
this is one of those events that we look

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,340
forward to a lot and it means a lot to

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:26,220
us for several reasons it's kind of hard

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,810
to follow by follow after frost after

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,939
and all those touching words they said

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,439
about how we care about values and you

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,000
will hear me talk a little bit more

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,250
about that because we do really care

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,250
about that the reason why we come to

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,200
these events is to meet friends that

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,410
we've made through angular we also want

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,600
to come and meet new faces talk to users

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,360
of angular understand you know what's

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,670
going on how how are people using

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,530
angular what are the improvements we

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,370
should be thinking about we can discuss

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,410
some of the challenges ideas and and

00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:01,430
together set direction for angular for

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,430
the next coming months and years

00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:09,090
as we are talking to developers in DC

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,030
and one of the common questions we get

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,369
is why do you build angular why do you

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,890
do this why why is this important why do

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,250
you wake up every morning and work on

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,409
this crazy stuff and some people suspect

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,240
that it has something to do with being a

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,729
software engineer that we want to come

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,700
and just pack and code and do something

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:32,159
that people admire but actually our

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,159
goals are much deeper than that what we

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,409
are trying to do is to enable creations

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:42,270
of applications that people love to use

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:43,500
people feel good about using and we want

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,020
these applications to be built by

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,850
developers that love what they do that

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,369
they love building these applications

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,659
they feel productive and we want this

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:56,280
developers to be part of the community

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:58,079
that is welcoming and inclusive one of

00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,820
the question follow up question I get

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,079
often afterwards is like well how big is

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,229
this community that we are talking about

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,509
and while it's very difficult for us to

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,220
estimate the right numbers we have

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,379
several signals that tell us about the

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,870
community growth and one of them is one

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,730
of them one of the strong indicators is

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,590
the number of people that come to avoid

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,330
properties to learn about angular to

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,370
look at the api's to learn about what's

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,000
happening what kind of events are we

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,349
putting up and what we see is that

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,769
angularjs is currently going through

00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:32,010
this period of stability while angular

00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:36,000
is going through this enormous period of

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:39,450
increase in interest we see lots of new

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,730
people coming and the growth of angular

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,849
is much bigger than what we seen with

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,769
angularjs in the past years but those

00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:48,420
were just numbers you know what really

00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:50,819
matters is the people the people that

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,060
come here the people that use angular

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:56,250
outside of this walls and as we as we

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,829
talk to you to you guys one thing that

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,510
we realized is that we see that the

00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:02,640
growth in in angular is fuelled by

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,319
people that are migrating from angularjs

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,360
to angular which is awesome that's why

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,220
we want to see but we also see lots of

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,620
new faces people that never used

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,829
angularjs and are joining our community

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,319
through angular and this is awesome one

00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:18,930
thing we need to be mindful of is that

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,180
as these new people are joining we need

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,579
to remember that this is a community

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,739
that has certain values I am so glad

00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:27,720
that the conference organizers are

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,700
taking this very seriously and this this

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,859
year they're really putting a big effort

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,549
on making sure that everybody feels safe

00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:36,930
and welcomed here we want this to be not

00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:38,609
specific just to this conference we want

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:43,139
it to be across the whole angular

00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:45,870
ecosystem we codified our code of

00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,180
conduct we can you can visit it on you

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,739
can read on github but what it really

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,700
boils down to is we want everybody to be

00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:55,519
respected and we pledge that we're gonna

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,829
respect everybody in this community

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,750
frosty talked a lot about you know the

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:03,239
code of conduct here the conference and

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,130
the escalation path please use that for

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,540
this venue but we want to make sure that

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,310
we also know how to handle situations

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,310
outside of the wall of this conference

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,810
and what we've seen in the past is that

00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,840
when you feel even you're in the

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:19,099
situation where you feel that the code

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,169
of conduct is not being honored the most

00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:24,060
powerful way to resolve the situation is

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,340
just respectfully remind everybody

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,100
involved of our code of conduct

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,139
of our values this mostly works this

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,169
works in most of the cases but when it

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,030
doesn't we want to know that we care and

00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:38,250
if there is a severe issue going on or a

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,900
systemic issue we want to hear about you

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,080
so we want to hear about this so that we

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,150
can help you can drop us an email at

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,530
contact at angular IO and we'll do our

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:52,139
best to get engaged in help you angular

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,330
is a community of values and it will

00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:57,060
only remain this way if everybody that

00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,729
participates in a community helps us

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,320
protect these values and extend the the

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:02,550
feeling of welcome and inclusiveness

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,560
that we experience when we join a

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,180
community to all the people that are

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,220
joining the community now and that will

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,479
be joining in the next few months so

00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:15,150
please keep this in mind with that

00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:17,310
Steven good morning everyone awesome

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,720
good to hear from you guys so my name is

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,610
Steven fluent and I'm a developer

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,740
advocate on the angular team at Google

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,120
so Igor started talking about this idea

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,430
of community and people that are

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,020
building with angular but actually want

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,360
to broaden that concept a little bit and

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,010
talk about an entire ecosystem one of

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,220
the most important parts of an ecosystem

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,320
is consistency and so you've heard Igor

00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,340
refer to a couple terms that you're

00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,919
going to hear kind of throughout this

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,570
conference so just for consistency sake

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,280
so we're all using the same words you're

00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,990
gonna hear us use the term angularjs

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,960
when we're talking about any of the old

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,340
version 1x version and we're also going

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,380
to use the term angular when we refer to

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,389
version 2 version 4 or anything really

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,950
beyond that we feel like these terms are

00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:57,840
simpler and we feel like these are terms

00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,789
that are gonna continue to work for us

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,169
for a long long period of time and then

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:03,000
also make it easier for us to

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:05,130
communicate about what's going on in the

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,200
ecosystem another piece if you're

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,270
writing any sort of content or blogs if

00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,650
you use these terms it's gonna help

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,210
things like search engine optimization

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,889
and it's gonna make it easier for people

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:16,320
coming into the community an ecosystem

00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:20,250
to understand what's going on by being

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,780
all very consistent in terms of our

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,970
ecosystem one of the most important

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,590
parts that we talk about is actually the

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,810
amount of meetups that are happening in

00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,340
conferences across the world so ng-conf

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,930
is one of the most important ones and

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,610
we're really happy to be here but

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,550
there's actually more than 700 different

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,830
meetup groups listed on meetup that

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,240
discuss or are about angular and that's

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,020
really exciting because they're actually

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,060
across the globe

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,280
they're in over a hundred countries at

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,690
this point and if you look at the

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,700
meetups and you just pull up the list

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,010
what you'll notice is that on any given

00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,320
week day there can be more than 20

00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,850
meetups in a single day just about

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,680
angular and people talking about these

00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,020
sorts of concepts which is a really

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,670
exciting thing and if you look at just

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,250
the period of energy comp so these three

00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:04,680
days there's actually 48 meetups

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,420
happening all about angular and actually

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,250
a lot of these groups are watching live

00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,960
so hello everyone on the livestream

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,010
thank you guys so much for coming you

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,760
guys are an important part of the

00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:17,250
community as well another measurement

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,050
that we have for our ecosystem health is

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,970
surveys that are done by various

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,140
organizations out in the world one of

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,880
the ones that we've looked at recently

00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,190
that just came out was a survey that was

00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,450
done by Stack Overflow and so what they

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,740
did is they they sent out this survey

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:31,350
and one of the metrics they looked at

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,910
was people that use libraries frameworks

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,950
and other tools to build web

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,440
applications and according to their

00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:39,690
numbers what they were seeing 44% of the

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,000
respondents are using angularjs or

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,920
angular and so we are right now the

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,110
biggest and so we're really excited to

00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,440
kind of be in that place and see that

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,430
sort of community response from everyone

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,740
another important part of the ecosystem

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,420
is the ways that you can get help when

00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,190
you're trying to try new things or

00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,720
getting started with angular so there's

00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,700
a number of different organizations out

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,440
there that do education so if you're a

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,540
new developer trying to get started with

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,770
the framework or if you are a company

00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,870
that's looking for someone to come in

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,190
and give training we have a bunch of

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,840
companies that are doing an awesome job

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,220
at that and that's something that we

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,720
really want to support and continue to

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:14,190
work with those to make sure they're

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,170
always providing the the latest and

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,820
greatest information but also it may be

00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,710
you don't have all the necessary talent

00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,030
inside of your company there's a number

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,760
of different consultants out in the

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,620
community that can help you build and

00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,660
adopt new practices with angular and

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,800
really use it to the best effect which

00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,170
is something that we feel is really

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:36,570
important about and having a very

00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:40,200
healthy ecosystem the angular project is

00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:42,150
a bunch of repos on github but it's also

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,830
a lot more than that there's a number of

00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,720
different community projects across the

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,460
entire internet that really make angular

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,110
much more successful than if we were

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,520
trying to do this all on our own and if

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,890
you look across the web you're gonna see

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,550
a number of different tools in projects

00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,959
that are built

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,430
maintained and managed by the community

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,310
and these includes things like

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:02,010
integrated development environments SDKs

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:04,440
tools for getting started scaffolding

00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,810
out new projects seeds that can help you

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,209
go faster all the way to linting tools

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,350
and tools that analyze and understand

00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:12,480
your code and help you become a more

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,519
effective developer and all of these

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,790
things are really things that we love to

00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:21,690
see and part of why the community is is

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:24,390
one of the best in the world beyond just

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,950
building for yourself on angular I want

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,839
to kind of share this idea that you can

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,550
build frameworks on top of angular and

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,740
so you can take the things that we're

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,850
using and building for you and actually

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,779
extend them and build your own

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,640
communities and build your own

00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:37,620
ecosystems and there's a number of

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,820
different places that we see this and so

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,579
this week one of the things that we're

00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,829
announcing is we were announcing

00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:46,170
guidance for how to build and ship

00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:47,850
libraries so historically there's been a

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:53,910
few examples out in the community yeah

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:55,980
we're excited about this so on Friday

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,990
Jason is going to be talking a lot more

00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,850
about how to build and ship libraries

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,839
with angular and the guidance here what

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,790
we're really trying to do is trying to

00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,779
say hey here are some best practices in

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,610
terms of how to lay out your project

00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:07,620
structure but also how to build and

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,850
distribute your project in a way that's

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,910
going to be easy for developers to

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,350
consume as well as easy for you to be as

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,529
up-to-date as possible as angular

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,209
continues to evolve another way that you

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:21,660
can build on us is a project from the

00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:22,500
material team within angular so they for

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,060
those of you don't know the material

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,220
team is really focused on providing a

00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,320
set of components that take the best

00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,510
practices from Google and our material

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,399
design philosophy and making those

00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,649
reusable within your components with

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,360
very kind of little lead leg work but as

00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,470
they've built this library of components

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,300
one of things they've done is they've

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,820
pulled out some of the essential pieces

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,040
of building great angular components and

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,260
there's trying to make it possible for

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,399
you guys to reuse some of their work so

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,020
I definitely recommend you take a look

00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,130
at what they're calling the component

00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,570
dev kit and so this is something that's

00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,579
in development and continuing to

00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,529
progress but in particular they're doing

00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:57,480
things like overlays so if you want to

00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,769
pop something up in the global context

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,449
of the screen and kind of interrupt the

00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:02,820
user interaction they've got some best

00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:04,649
practices around that gestures so how do

00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,020
how does a user interact in a best

00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:08,490
practice way with your application

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,050
all the way down to accessibility in

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,240
terms of growing in supporting the

00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,490
audience and the visitors and users of

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,360
your applications so that's something

00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,710
that we're we're gonna continue

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,530
developing that we're really excited

00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:22,590
about another way that you can build on

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,810
top of us is using things like the CLI

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,520
so a few weeks ago we finally reached

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:33,240
version 1.0 of the COI which we were

00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:34,950
really excited about yeah so the the CI

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,420
has been a long time coming we really

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,240
feel that it's one of the best ways to

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,680
build and your applications today and we

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,720
really want to continue to extend that

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,420
and embrace that concept and what we

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,860
figured out is that within the CLI there

00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,270
are a bunch of best practices and

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,950
there's a bunch of pieces of code that

00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,840
we've written in wisdom that we've built

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,370
into the CLI and so what we're doing is

00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,680
we're looking at ways that we can

00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,690
extract that wisdom into more of an SDK

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,000
model that enables other developers

00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,190
other tool chains to use those best

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,240
practices we've gotten in that project a

00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,800
little bit started with something we

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,050
call ng tools that's already being used

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,940
within the CLI that anyone that's using

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,290
webpack is probably familiar with we

00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,150
want to continue to double down on that

00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,460
concept and invest in that further a

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,500
great example of how these things can

00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,480
play together is actually an IDE that

00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,700
was recently released by a company

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,400
called Genoa tech so this is an idea

00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,500
they call angular IDE and so it's an

00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,330
eclipse modern Eclipse plug-in that

00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,470
tries to make it easier to build and

00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,670
work with angular and so what they've

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,800
done is they've built in all the

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,360
right-click functionality to create new

00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,010
projects create new components create

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,750
new pieces but what they're doing is

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,700
under the hood they're actually passing

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:40,860
that all back to the CLI into an

00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,810
embedded node instance to make it easier

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,860
for developers to use and so that that's

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,010
a concept that we're really excited

00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,960
about another concept of really excited

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,770
about is our language services so for

00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,360
those of you that don't know our

00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,160
language services it's a set of

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,190
intelligence that we're building on top

00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,750
of angular that integrates into your IDE

00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,910
and what this does that will give you

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,040
things like code completion within

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,450
templates in a way that's aware of

00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,980
what's going on within your components

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,420
right so we can look at the types we can

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,160
look at the objects in your components

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,530
and expose that when you're writing the

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,470
HTML in this declarative syntax that is

00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,480
so popular within angular right now we

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,280
just this week we shipped our first

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,660
experimental version of the vs code

00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,579
extension and the bindings to the

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,679
service webstorm has already done this

00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:24,389
integration and angular IDE is also

00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,769
integrated into this so this is how

00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:27,209
we've gotten things started we're going

00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:29,220
to continue to invest and work on these

00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:30,420
things to make it easier but we really

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,889
do want to look to the community a

00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,329
little bit to extend these things and

00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:35,100
say hey are there ways that you can

00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:37,079
embed the the language services in your

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,610
project or your IDE so that we can make

00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:43,199
this experience great for all developers

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,059
another example of a company that is

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,670
working a lot to build on top of what

00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:51,379
angular offers is ionic and so I'd like

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,379
to introduce two stage Josh Thomas

00:13:53,119 --> 00:14:01,279
thanks thanks Steven hi I'm Josh Thomas

00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:03,839
I'm one of the core developers on ionic

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,369
over the last couple years we've had the

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,429
opportunity to work with the angular

00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:10,499
team after we released ionic version 1

00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:12,779
they reached out to us and we worked

00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:14,519
with them as we built ionic version 2

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,189
while they were developing the latest

00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,199
version of angular this can open

00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:21,809
communication collaboration that we had

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,579
with this awesome team has really led to

00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:26,129
our success with the latest version of

00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:28,529
ionic in one way that we consider

00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:30,419
ourselves successful is by the adoption

00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:32,819
rate of the latest version of ionic

00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:35,970
we've got over 1 million installs right

00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:39,809
now of ionic v2 we're really excited

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:41,910
about this we think that developers are

00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:45,449
embracing the latest version of ionic

00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:48,839
because it's just ionic and it's just

00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:50,669
angular but it doesn't hurt that angular

00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,470
has one of the most friendly web

00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:56,040
developer experiences available today

00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:58,139
and we know that developers love working

00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,899
with ionic and angular because they tell

00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:03,149
us they tell us about how they really

00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,769
like building one code base for iOS

00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:06,959
Android and for the web

00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:09,720
they love the ability to collaborate

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,999
during the development process with

00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,860
front-end developers back-end developers

00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:16,110
and even designers but what they really

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,419
love most of all is creating

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:24,679
high-quality applications that are

00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:26,819
mobile one example of this is untapped

00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,669
untapped is an application that allows

00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:31,230
you to share and discover new beers that

00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:32,160
you've just got that you like with

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,550
friends

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,430
there are 1 million installs of untapped

00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:40,440
right now on Android devices alone and

00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,690
I'm gonna assume that some of you in the

00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,550
crowd probably have this installed on

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,160
iOS and if you do come find me

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:48,660
afterwards and let's share so it's great

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,990
people in the community are grilled

00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:55,350
building great things with ionic v2 now

00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:59,430
what are we doing back at ionic well

00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:03,309
today we're releasing ionic version 3

00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,309
[Applause]

00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:12,050
this is built on top of angular version

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:16,730
4 it features a faster boot time it also

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:18,470
has desktop and tablet support we're

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:35,240
really excited about where things are

00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:38,030
going thank you so we've heard a little

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,140
bit about who we are within the angular

00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,300
team in it within the angular ecosystem

00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,830
in community now we want to turn a

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,320
little bit more towards what is the

00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,760
state of angular today and so again in

00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,750
the vein of the questions that we ask

00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,550
most often

00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,920
how is angular being used in production

00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,720
today and so there's a number of very

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,820
large companies that are using angular

00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,560
at scale which we're very excited to see

00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,710
them do this in production in the public

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,970
but also what we've seen from talking to

00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:04,190
companies and from our research is that

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,660
about 90 percent of angular applications

00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,850
that are built every day are actually

00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,579
behind the firewall and so we have very

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,050
little visibility into those but based

00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:14,390
on the data that we're seeing there's

00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:16,310
about 100 applications using angular

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,230
launching in production every day

00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,579
excuse me more than 100 and so we're

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,230
very excited to see these numbers and

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,720
we're continuing to see them increase

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,280
over time another really exciting

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,150
statistic that we've been able to pull

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,950
is that about 17% of the domains that

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,410
are running an angular application today

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,270
are already using version 4 and so we're

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,800
really excited to see this kind of

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,290
wholehearted adoption by the community

00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,330
of these very easy updates across major

00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,710
releases and so this is based on the the

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:46,190
data that we can see from the Google

00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:48,020
search index one of my favorite

00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,090
companies that uses angular's Google I

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,930
work for them so I maybe I have to say

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:55,760
that but angular is actually very

00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,800
important within Google so we're at a

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,680
point now within Google where almost 200

00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,870
applications are built using angular and

00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:06,050
it's the goal of the team that all of

00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,820
the active angularjs projects migrate to

00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:10,100
angular by the end of the year so we're

00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,960
very excited by that

00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,450
and to give another great example of

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,880
angular in production at scale I want to

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:19,969
invite Brian Martin to the stage

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,969
[Applause]

00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,240
[Music]

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,430
everybody my name is Brian Martin and

00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,760
I'm a lead developer for Turner we

00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:31,900
create mba.com

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,850
so I wanted to talk to you a little bit

00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,610
about how we're currently using

00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:40,510
angularjs along with our Drupal content

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:43,090
management system in production so these

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,230
are our game detail pages on the left

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,320
here you can see our scoreboard

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,900
component using the scoreboard component

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:54,070
you can drag up to four games at the

00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,300
same time live or archived and play them

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,800
on the right

00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,740
the whole time that you're doing this

00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,170
it's firing off events to the custom

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,930
component over here on the right and you

00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:07,090
can change the broadcast you can you

00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:09,610
know change the games out do whatever

00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,560
you'd like as you scroll down here you

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:16,480
see our matchup tab

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:19,120
this shows d3 graphing for both of the

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,580
team stats up top and the team stats

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:29,790
down here below and you got some kind of

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:32,650
cool graphics there so typescript

00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:34,270
although we weren't sure about it at

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,570
first because it's like why do you want

00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,920
to use JavaScript to write JavaScript

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,920
after we started getting access to the

00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,800
latest version of Eknath scripts and

00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,630
strict typing we really just loved it

00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,880
now

00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,410
things like observables and I won't go

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,140
through all the different standards but

00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:56,050
just being able to have a framework that

00:19:53,140 --> 00:20:00,400
really focuses on standards first is

00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:03,240
something that we really loved so things

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,770
like services dependency injection and

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,980
even classical inheritance now the

00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,420
latest version of active script allowed

00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,730
us to share a lot of the same

00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,950
programming paradigms between both

00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,200
Drupal and angular and allows developers

00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:21,600
to kind of switch between the two a lot

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,600
easier than other front-end frameworks

00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:28,330
so by having one framework or able to

00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:30,670
not have to worry about creating a

00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,830
collection of libraries and kind of

00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:36,440
bundling that all together and it lets

00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:39,210
us get started a lot faster

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,100
with Drupal blocks you can output a

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,320
little bit of HTML and then attach

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,659
whatever JavaScript code you want to

00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,580
that block and an editorial can go in

00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:49,799
and move that wherever you'd like all

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:52,799
over the page and now you've got like a

00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:57,570
really cool custom component anywhere on

00:20:52,799 --> 00:21:00,500
the site we use things like dragula

00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:04,140
which we showed on the game detail pages

00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:08,549
ng RX d3 and then we're also looking

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:12,929
into using the infinite scroll coming up

00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:15,720
here in the future by being able to pull

00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:18,029
in like 15 different feeds all from our

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,520
structured data team and they'd have

00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:23,429
observables and redux data stores that

00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,980
we then push all that content to or able

00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:29,159
to rapidly write out all the HTML for

00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,870
the page and not have to worry too much

00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,779
about how the performance is because

00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:38,450
everything is streamlined with the

00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:43,049
observables we integrate data from

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:46,799
structured data adds analytics geo

00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:48,929
services our membership and SSO services

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,059
that's just what I can name off the top

00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:55,500
of my head by being able to do all that

00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:57,720
it's really interesting to see just how

00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,720
much we can integrate into the entire

00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:08,850
application and it really solves all of

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:11,179
our use cases really nicely and I hit

00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,179
the wrong button

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:21,830
okay so now Igor let's go for it

00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,830
thank you Brian hmm

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,860
it's really exciting to see NBA and

00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,540
other big companies embrace angular and

00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,000
start building these applications that

00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:38,510
are visible to many many users and touch

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,850
many lives Stephan already mentioned a

00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:44,360
little bit about angular version 4 that

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:51,290
we released was 8 days nine days ago two

00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:52,400
weeks ago no way I think was nine and we

00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,640
you know this was a release that we

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,930
announced last year and when we when we

00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:01,670
started talking about angular version

00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:04,429
four we we said the theme of need for

00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,740
angular to evolve and version for being

00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:09,440
the first step in that direction we set

00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,880
several goals for version four we wanted

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,559
to make it better for users we wanted to

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,270
make it better for developers and we

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,070
also wanted to make sure that it's super

00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:18,890
smooth to get from version 2 to version

00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:22,400
4 so that everybody feels like they're

00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:24,470
not being left behind and they can just

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,440
get all the benefits of version 4 so

00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,059
let's see how we did with version 4 one

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,130
of the biggest benefits for users is

00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,780
that the time to interactive is

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,660
significantly better the way we've done

00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:38,390
that is we'd reduce the size of the

00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,220
application all the applications as soon

00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,590
as you download angular and recompile

00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,120
your application with version 4 you will

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,250
see that the payload sizes of these

00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,830
applications are smaller in most cases

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,230
we hear about 60% reduction of size

00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,910
which is quite amazing especially given

00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,580
that all you had to do was just download

00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:58,150
and recompile the application this

00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,800
result is much faster bootstrap and much

00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:03,380
much interactive user experience when

00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:07,250
the user starts your application we've

00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,510
done this through major improvements in

00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,750
the compiler infrastructure and

00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:13,640
rendering layer of angular tobias Bosh

00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,230
is gonna talk about all of the crazy

00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,960
changes that we've done under the hood

00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,520
later today in his talk about the

00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,670
angular compiler and the rendering layer

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,210
so please check it out when it comes to

00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:28,910
developers version 4 brings several

00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:31,370
improvements we added new api's we made

00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,320
it easier to use and ufmg for some of

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,880
the most commonly used directives now

00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,270
the syntax for some of the scenarios

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,350
especially if you are using reactive

00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,440
parrot

00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,390
with angular is much much better we

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,600
added new features to forms and many

00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:49,179
other api's we also changed the way we

00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,770
package angular and one of the there

00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:52,419
were two reasons for this we wanted to

00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,580
achieve the smaller payload size for the

00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:56,679
applications built with angular but we

00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:59,410
also wanted to make building angular

00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:01,179
applications faster by reducing the

00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:03,490
build latency and we achieve this

00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:05,140
through package format that Jason is

00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,000
going to talk about it's the same

00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:10,000
package format that we recommend the

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,720
libraries using are going forward and

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,940
lastly this was the first release of

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,150
angular that came with the release of

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:21,909
stable CLI version still untouched on on

00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:24,460
this topic a little bit the cool thing

00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:26,650
about CLI is that all you have to do is

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,990
to install the single tool and you can

00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,909
get started it will scaffold the project

00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:32,980
for you it will set up your testing

00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:34,720
environment the development to build

00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,850
pipelines so that you can iterate in the

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,650
application quickly and once you are

00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,780
ready to push your application to

00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:43,990
production we have a production pipeline

00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:47,169
that optimizes our your application

00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:50,110
through many steps that result in in

00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:54,130
small applications which deliver good

00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:55,929
user experience many people worried that

00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:58,210
version 4 is going to be a big change

00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,980
and I'm very proud to say that the team

00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,450
worked hard to make sure that there were

00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:04,210
no breaking changes to the stay be

00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:06,940
stable api's and we didn't change any

00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:09,130
anything that would endanger the common

00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,890
usage patterns so the way you learned

00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:14,830
angular 2 you can still use it as

00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:18,130
angular 4 it just got much better the

00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:22,070
results of using angular at version 4

00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:25,339
are much better thank you

00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,339
[Applause]

00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:31,040
tell us something about other things

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,500
we've done in before oh so many things

00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,910
in version four but most of them you

00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,010
didn't notice which was kind of the

00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:39,050
point right so really excited about that

00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:41,870
the the new micro syntax so you can say

00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:43,850
as an NG FNG for typescript for faster

00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,930
builds I don't know someone wrote a blog

00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,070
post that was really interesting it was

00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,360
like oh here's all the new things in

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,850
four and I'm like oh wow I didn't even

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,610
know we did all those things so thank

00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,560
you again to the community we couldn't

00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,730
do a lot of things without you so I want

00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,960
to talk about some of the state of the

00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,190
art that we released in 4 and some of

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,230
the things that are a little bit less

00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,810
stable so these are kind of experimental

00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,190
projects that we are we really believe

00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:06,050
in and we're gonna continue to invest in

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:08,150
but we do want your feedback and so

00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:10,160
these are my two favorite so the first

00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,440
one started as a community project

00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,390
called angular universal and we took

00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,920
over that project recently and we

00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:18,560
brought all of that code all of that

00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,060
effort with the community into the core

00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,980
angular repo and so for those of you

00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:23,810
don't know and your Universal is this

00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,570
idea that we can run and load your

00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:28,520
entire angular application Dom

00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:30,260
independent on instance or an

00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,660
environment like the server and then

00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,030
ship that down to the browser as static

00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:37,310
HTML and then bootstrap angular on top

00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,230
of that and so the work that we did that

00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:41,420
culminated in the angular universal

00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,760
release that came with version 4 is that

00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,800
now in platform server we actually have

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,720
a single method that will take in like

00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,100
your index file and your your routing

00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,690
configuration or any other state that

00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,400
you want to provide it and then it will

00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,560
render your entire angular application

00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,570
and the current state out to a string so

00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,250
we've laid the foundation for you guys

00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:01,010
in terms of these underlying rendering

00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,600
api's that let you then do a more

00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,160
advanced or expressive binding in

00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,840
whatever sort of build environment you

00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,320
do and so we're looking to make it easy

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,490
and help you guys a little bit with the

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,720
building if you're using Express if

00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,220
you're using dotnet if you're using Java

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,300
we want to continue to extend that and

00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,040
make that easier to use

00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,960
well we've got today right now is a

00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,360
couple code samples but then this this

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,430
fully thought-out fully fleshed out API

00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,350
for for doing that and the reason you'd

00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:26,390
want to use annular Universal is for a

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,710
number of different reasons it makes

00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,510
your application a little bit faster

00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,340
right so the time that a user has to

00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,870
wait before they see a fully rendered

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,700
version of your application is lower if

00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,380
you're rendering it server-side but then

00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,540
we can still get all of that nice

00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,400
developer and use Erick

00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:41,170
perience vibe bootstrapping the same

00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,750
application on top of it but then

00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:45,010
there's also content scrapers so such as

00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,070
if you're posting to Twitter and you

00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:49,510
want that to come from your application

00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:50,620
rendering it statically and then serving

00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,850
that version of Twitter so that they

00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,080
actually see what the page looks like

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,150
without having to run any of your

00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,370
JavaScript can give you a functional

00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,990
advantage so you don't have to rely on a

00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:02,320
separate rendering layer or something

00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:04,060
that crawls your website my other

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,560
favorite experimental project that we

00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,810
we've really embedded and double down on

00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,940
right now is support for what we call

00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:11,830
progressive web applications so

00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,410
progressive web applications are really

00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,580
this goal in this desire to take the

00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,670
applications that we're writing today

00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:20,380
and add a couple more cool features to

00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:22,870
them and turn them progressively when

00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:25,690
available in certain browsers into more

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:27,520
full-fledged applications and so it

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,140
really is about radically improving the

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,900
user experience and we do this in a

00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,060
number of ways so the first way is that

00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,260
we now if you use it progressive web app

00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,390
and if you have a serviceworker

00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,700
installed you can enable your

00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:41,440
application in less reliable internet

00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,140
connections or even offline use cases

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,420
right so we are embedding and building a

00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,340
caching and a proxy layer that will

00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:50,590
store all of the assets you need to run

00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,870
your application in the user's browser

00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:54,190
so the next time they call that up it

00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,740
will be available even if they're not

00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,550
online another side effect of doing this

00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,620
is that it actually makes your

00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:01,600
applications much faster so instead of

00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,910
having to wait for any sort of network

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,890
in order for your application to boot or

00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:07,630
to load you were pulling those from

00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:09,220
local disk or local memory and so your

00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,530
application bootstraps much more quickly

00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,150
and then the last way that we really

00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,370
believe progressive web apps help users

00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:17,530
and make better experiences is that they

00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,210
build more engaging experiences so one

00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,280
of the features of service workers and

00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,510
have progressive web applications as the

00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,460
ability to turn on things like push

00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:26,050
notifications where for the first time

00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,880
you can interact with the users of your

00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:30,040
web application when they're not

00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,650
actively staring at the screen and so

00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,090
this is a really cool capability that

00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,890
you're starting this pop see pop up

00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,390
across the web whenever you see that do

00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,370
you want to allow this site to send

00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:42,460
notifications and we're building in

00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:44,590
those sorts of capabilities into our PWA

00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,790
support within angular so today as I

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,650
mentioned it's experimental

00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,870
we actually have shipped this as a flag

00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,070
in the CLI so if you go into your CLI

00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,259
configuration and you

00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,600
a service worker true for any of the

00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:56,679
apps in your config we will

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,539
automatically when you do a production

00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,669
build we will look at all the assets

00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:02,350
being generated by the CLI we will make

00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:04,120
a manifest we will catch those offline

00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,559
and then we will ship your application

00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,289
with a service worker that gets

00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:09,669
installed and manages that cache

00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:11,919
basically automatically for you and so

00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:13,690
we're excited to continue to invest in

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,570
this and work on this to make it better

00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,399
more reliable with the idea that we can

00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:29,980
make every web application that exists

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:32,379
today more app-like and better so that

00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,759
was version for anybody wondering now

00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:39,610
that we're done with version 4 what's

00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:41,440
next what's coming Wow well somebody

00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:44,289
said five but we do have a history of

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:49,000
skipping versions so you never know you

00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:50,799
never know with us so back last year

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,870
when we start talking about version 4 we

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,450
also talked about why we need to involve

00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,980
one we need to why we want angular to

00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,080
evolve and this there are several

00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,460
reasons for this the user expectations

00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,419
are changing and with that we need to

00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,340
adjust you know what kind of

00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,169
applications you are building the web

00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,240
ecosystem outside of angular is not

00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:09,190
static it's also evolving the standards

00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,799
are voting the browser is evolving angle

00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,809
needs to be able to keep up with this

00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:16,289
changes and adjust and take advantage of

00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:18,759
all this new stuff that is coming and

00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:22,419
allows us to make applications better

00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:24,370
but it's also about making sure that

00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:26,500
angular itself keeps on getting better

00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:28,090
and we want to set this pace they want

00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,009
to set the cadence for the whole

00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:32,230
community so we can evolve together I

00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:34,990
was just recently talking to Daniel from

00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:37,000
the typescript team and I was really

00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:39,100
pleased to hear that they are also

00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,870
thinking of adopting time-based release

00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,700
just like we did and this will help us

00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,769
all synchronize you know how we evolve

00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,809
together because angular even if you're

00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:48,909
not using typescript as for building

00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:50,620
application angle itself the compiler

00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:52,360
takes advantage of many of the things

00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,580
that obscure has to provide so you don't

00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:59,470
have to be using typescript directly to

00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:00,820
be using typescript so as we evolve

00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:02,950
there are several things that we need to

00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:04,909
do to evolve at an incremental and

00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,859
predictable pace on

00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:08,479
what we've done is adopted several tools

00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,979
and processes that allows us to manage

00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:11,570
this one of them is semantic versioning

00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:13,519
many of you are probably familiar with

00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:15,859
this but let me just quickly repeat it

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,960
what we will see is that in the patch

00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:21,249
versions that will be coming out you

00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:24,019
will be receiving just fixes you will be

00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:26,179
cutting minor releases in these you will

00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:29,389
get features that you can automatically

00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:31,279
upgrade to there is no nothing that you

00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:33,830
need to do special to just get to those

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,169
versions and with major versions often

00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:38,419
major versions for people mean breaking

00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:40,609
changes for us they just mean we did a

00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:42,919
lot of stuff we need extra time for you

00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:44,809
to validate this is major versions have

00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:47,629
extended our C periods through which we

00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:49,549
collect feedback and for us my major

00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:51,289
versions means we're trying to do

00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:54,169
something awesome we are trying to

00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:56,119
change angular in a good way so that you

00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:57,950
can take advantage you can build better

00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,299
applications but we also want to make

00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,950
sure that it's very simple for you to

00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:02,929
upgrade so we're doing a lot to make

00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,279
sure that major version doesn't mean a

00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:06,440
big obstacle it's just something that

00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:08,270
you want to know by you want to plan and

00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,819
plan for and once it's ready you want to

00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:12,289
give us feedback about whether it's

00:34:10,819 --> 00:34:13,879
working for you whether there are issues

00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:16,159
we can fix that before the release and

00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:17,450
then once the major version is cut it

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,319
should be super straightforward for you

00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:23,329
to jump on but semantic versioning is

00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:26,059
primarily meant for tools and just to

00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:29,750
describe what's in a release what

00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:31,129
matters to what makes a good combo a

00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,589
semantic versioning is time-based

00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:35,480
releases because this really sets the

00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:37,970
expectations as to when the changes are

00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,700
coming and what we committed to was that

00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:42,230
we're gonna be releasing patch releases

00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,029
every week and you've seen that do that

00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:47,000
consistently over the last several

00:34:44,029 --> 00:34:48,919
months minor versions we want to cut

00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,899
those once a month during the first

00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:53,809
three periods of a six months release

00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:56,299
cycle and every six months you can

00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:58,309
expect from us a major version so with

00:34:56,299 --> 00:35:00,349
this it should not be surprised that in

00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:00,799
September or in October actually in

00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:04,460
October

00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:06,109
we'll be cutting angular 5 and it's not

00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:08,299
a big deal it's just gonna be much

00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:12,289
better angular that you'll be able to

00:35:08,299 --> 00:35:14,210
take advantage of very very easily to

00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:17,580
understand why we're evolving angular in

00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:22,040
this way why the incremental changes why

00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:23,880
we need to push angular you have to

00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:27,300
understand a little bit about how we use

00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,130
angular at Google at Google we use the

00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,710
previous versions of angular and the way

00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:33,840
we do that is as we build angular on

00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:36,420
github as a open source project

00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,370
we send full requests with ideas with

00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,840
the things we want to change before we

00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,670
merge any of these poor requests we

00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,890
actually validate that the pluralist is

00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:46,110
not gonna break anybody at Google we

00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:48,720
have growing number of applications with

00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:50,850
test suites that we can trigger and we

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,180
test every floor request against this

00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:56,640
large test suite as soon as we get a

00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,870
green light we merge these changes and

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,690
bring them to Google and from that

00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:02,700
moment on full request by full request

00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,080
Google applications are taking advantage

00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,570
of all these changes we made through

00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,450
different for requests this means that

00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:12,090
we feel very good about the stability of

00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,250
angular because there is no like special

00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:16,110
version of angular at Google it's just

00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,330
the latest version that is on github on

00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:21,540
the master branch that's that's the the

00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:24,540
version of angular that Google's using

00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:27,780
and there are many benefits that you get

00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,910
out of this and also reasons why we want

00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,430
you to stay as close to head as you're

00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:33,990
comfortable with and mostly we mean you

00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,120
should be on the the latest minor

00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:38,580
version because that's the version that

00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,100
was validated we know that that's the

00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:43,200
version that works really well we also

00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,120
know that by you staying close to the

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,010
development of English to the head of

00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,170
development you will be receiving the

00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:51,390
latest features and latest fixes and

00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:53,520
because we do explicit testing with

00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:56,070
other things like material design CLI

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,720
and other component libraries we know

00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,160
that these are the versions that will

00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,240
give you compatible to across the whole

00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:05,730
ecosystem this is great especially if

00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,550
you have the flexibility and ability and

00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,140
have the engineering power of Google and

00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:12,660
are able to set up continuous

00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,100
integration systems and plan ahead but

00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,050
we understand that there are some of you

00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:18,690
that don't have this flexibility whether

00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,700
it's because you work at a company where

00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,050
you have regulation regulatory

00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,810
constraints that prevent you from

00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:27,050
upgrading or you are the company where

00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:29,999
there are internal processes that make

00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:32,459
upgrades very expensive because of

00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:35,279
legal reviews security reviews for those

00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:37,409
of you on we have a solution for the

00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:39,660
first time ever we want to introduce the

00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:40,480
long term support for angular

00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,679
[Applause]

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,679
[Music]

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,390
so version 4 is the first version of

00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:52,970
angular that we are offering a long term

00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:55,819
support for what does this mean for the

00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,559
next six months until October we'll be

00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:59,030
actively working on angular 4 will be

00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:02,000
releasing features will be releasing

00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:05,290
fixes now in October version 4 will

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,300
enter the long-term support state and

00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:10,670
from there on only the critical fixes

00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,680
and security patches will be merged and

00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,930
released this will give you peace in

00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,720
mind that if your company can't move as

00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:20,270
quickly as everybody else in a community

00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,710
you have a version that you can rely on

00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,069
and will be there to support you should

00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:30,230
there be security issues or some

00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:32,359
unpredictable problems having said that

00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:34,609
we're still hoping that most of the

00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:36,230
community will embrace this piece of

00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:38,630
development where everybody's on the

00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,730
latest version of angular and to make

00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:42,650
this more attractive I would like to

00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:45,619
talk to you about the themes that we are

00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:48,349
setting for version 5 we started as soon

00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:50,119
as we release version 4 thinking about

00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:52,040
you know what what is it that we need to

00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,740
do in version 5 what is it that kind of

00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,260
push angular in the right direction and

00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,430
gonna make a difference and we said

00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,760
these three themes for angular

00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:04,220
simplicity we know that getting started

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,720
with the open especially if you have

00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,240
been on the server side and coming to

00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,980
the client side can be confusing we want

00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,630
to reduce the number of options you stay

00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:15,140
on the happy path on the path of

00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:17,150
building great applications out of the

00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:23,450
box one of the things we are doing to do

00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:24,950
this is we're gonna simplify the way we

00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:27,020
compile our angular applications right

00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,520
now it's very common that in the

00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,410
development mode you use what we call

00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,480
just-in-time compilation this is a

00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:34,369
compilation process through which which

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,150
is very fast and results in the fast

00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:40,130
development lifecycle and then when

00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:42,260
you're ready for go to production use

00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:44,599
the optimizing compiler that we call the

00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,980
head of time compiler sometimes there

00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:47,390
are differences between this two which

00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,770
can be frustrating because you work on

00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,390
application and when you're ready to

00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,040
ship you realize oh there are these

00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:54,080
things that you still need to do before

00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,630
you can actually build up an application

00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,830
and push it to production so what we are

00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,480
going to do is we're gonna make the

00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,770
ahead of time compilation the default

00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,960
we're gonna do it by making it much

00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:05,390
faster and enabling incremental

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,250
compilation this will mean for you that

00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,750
you will have a single compilation

00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:11,600
process that you will use throughout the

00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:13,910
whole application development and will

00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,160
reduce the number of the friction in in

00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:19,250
development the other thing we are doing

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,740
is focusing on size and speed and you've

00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:24,560
heard us talking about us on this a lot

00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:26,690
in the version for the 60% reduction of

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,310
bundle size or the application size

00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,530
across-the-board was a good agreement

00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:33,470
but we realized that there is much more

00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:36,950
we can still do and if you know to be

00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:38,510
yes and his compiler tricks he's never

00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,460
done with tweaking the compiler and we

00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,930
have really cool things coming one of

00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,160
the things we'll be focusing on is

00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:46,040
making sure that when you're using

00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:49,550
component libraries like engine material

00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,050
ionic or or material design we are able

00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,460
to tree shake all the components that

00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,720
are not being used right now we are

00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,540
doing mostly but there are still some

00:40:53,720 --> 00:41:01,220
components that are being retained we

00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:02,390
will do much better in the version 5 and

00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:06,560
the last one I want to talk about is

00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:07,880
smooth of upgrades smooth upgrades just

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,380
like with version 4 we want to make it

00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,420
super easy for you to jump on and use it

00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,040
and we can do this only by making sure

00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,780
that there are no obstacles and we

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,670
commit to that and this is not something

00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,830
specific to version 4 or 5 you will see

00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:21,620
us doing that in the future version as

00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:23,480
well so let's see what table we talked

00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,830
about today we talked about you know who

00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,170
we are what kind of community we are

00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:29,090
what kind of values we have and how we

00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,560
want to protect and extend this values

00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:32,900
to all the people that I've joined in

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,930
the Anglican 'ti in the coming months

00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:38,330
and years we talked about where we are

00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:40,850
today with angular who uses angular

00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:43,280
there are big companies virgin forest is

00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:45,980
doing really well the 70 percent

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,390
adoption rate on public domains is quite

00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,130
amazing and it's exceeding our

00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:51,350
expectations and want to see more of

00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:53,060
this coming in the future and then we

00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:55,070
talked about our future plans we are

00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:57,260
never done in improving angular you'll

00:41:55,070 --> 00:42:02,090
see us tweaking things making things

00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:05,000
smaller faster simpler to use and this

00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:06,950
this is where angular's heading last

00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,310
year we concluded a keynote saying that

00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:12,800
it's okay for you to sit with us and I

00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:15,140
think this year it would be even cooler

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,630
while you sit with us you were also

00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:19,550
building stuff with us so I encourage

00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,050
you to just come and talk to us that our

00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:22,520
conference will have lots of places

00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,350
where angular team will be spread out

00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,060
you can come to us and talk and we can

00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,490
build stuff together thank you very much

00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:30,730
enjoy the rest of the conference

00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:30,730
