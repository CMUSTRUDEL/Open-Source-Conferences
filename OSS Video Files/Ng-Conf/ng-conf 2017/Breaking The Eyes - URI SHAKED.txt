[Applause]

00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:09,059
thank you thank you very much I'm

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,040
worried from blackberry we had some

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,389
issues with the sound but gladly we

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,870
solved it out we are going to use the

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:17,600
sound a lot in this smolder and today we

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,070
are going to talk about accessibility

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,779
let's start with a few common

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,330
misconceptions some of you may have

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,279
about what accessibility is so first of

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,680
all accessibility is not just about

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,170
blind people there are many diseases

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,989
that can cause blurry vision there is

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,230
also colored nidus and when we get to

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:40,500
the age around the age of 40 the lenses

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:43,290
inside our eyes tattoos its flexibility

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,680
and we are no longer able to focus on

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:50,039
closer objects such as laptop screens or

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,530
our mobile devices in addition to that

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,379
during the course of our life the

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,050
receptor cells inside our Tina slowly

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,870
die out so don't go out to the Sun too

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,680
much without sunglasses and the

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:07,200
resolution of our vision could get

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,860
slower and lower as we go on with our

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,510
lives so eventually we are all the

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,510
target audience of accessibility

00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:21,000
furthermore are blind or visually

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,549
impaired or disabled people use the

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,360
keyboard as the main way to access

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:30,240
software technology website and we can

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,689
help them by including accessibility

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,630
baking eat into our inside our web apps

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:40,710
we can make their life easier and make

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,649
it more useful for them and you may

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,810
imagine that blind people use screen

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,149
readers but it's a little different

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,520
probably a little different than what

00:01:48,149 --> 00:02:00,049
you have in mind let me show you how

00:01:50,520 --> 00:02:03,689
it's used in practice yes that's fast

00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:06,299
and now let's do some live coding we are

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,640
going to use a screen reader 31 it's a

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,250
Chrome extension called chromevox and

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,450
i'm going to switch to the screen where

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,250
we have this very nice I

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,690
our app it's the same demo that

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,430
everybody uses now in their

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,129
presentations because it's the default

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,720
and we all are default and the first

00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:24,730
thing we are going to do we are going to

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,530
make ourselves a little blind so we are

00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,709
going to apply a blur filter to this

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:34,090
page and now you can see the app and now

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:35,620
you can see it's blurry thank you and we

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,500
are going to build a little stack

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,900
overflow like up with questions and

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:45,250
answers where you can up vote for your

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,140
favorite question but unfortunately you

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,150
can't really see what's going on here so

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:57,040
I'm going to switch on the screen reader

00:02:49,150 --> 00:03:01,780
extension come on did you switch on did

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:04,660
we get any sound box is now inactive app

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:08,019
work oh yeah why does html think Jackie

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,940
Norris is a color yes that's a real

00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:14,280
question from Stack Overflow why does

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,280
html think Chuck Norris is a color

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,329
google eat after to find the answer and

00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,859
I really like this question I want to

00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:23,500
add vote for it so I'm going to try to

00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:26,500
use my tab key together address and

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,829
search unknown unknown address and

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,660
search bar localhost for unknown I can

00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:33,760
get her I can't vote for the question I

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,769
like so much but don't worry we are

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,079
going to solve this just by adding a few

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,239
attributes or component that implements

00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:43,660
the up vote so we are going to add a

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:49,269
couple of HTML attributes we have here

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:52,900
the the tab index which is making this

00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,940
element available for the keyboard we

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,769
also have this role button' which makes

00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,780
it the screen reader read out that it's

00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,940
a button and we also have a description

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,069
which the screen reader will read so

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,590
let's test it out and see if I can now

00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:09,459
upload for this lovely question window

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:15,599
upload I got the output button wait I

00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:19,180
didn't use it yet just a moment 20

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,620
upload 20 so we have 20 vote I'm going

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,620
to click the button al episode

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:37,410
upload button why did upload 21 yes I

00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:39,870
managed to vote free thank you so yeah

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:43,980
what I want you to take home from here

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,750
start using tabindex roll and etc oh by

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,330
the way if you want the code for this

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,850
demo I'm going to treat it right now so

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,850
you can find it to Twitter and play with

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:56,070
it and what I want you to take home from

00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,140
here first of all start using tabindex

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,110
role etc I'm going to publish a blog

00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,910
post about it in just a few hours on

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,340
Twitter with a complete code example

00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,320
second thing I want you to do start

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,840
testing your apps is visually challenged

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,090
person just use the keyboard you can use

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,360
the block filter or you can simply close

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,010
your eyes or shut down the monitor and

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,780
finally I really love the angular

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:22,020
community I think this is an awesome

00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,350
community so let's build accessible apps

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,350
and set an example for others to follow

00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,350
thank

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,279
you

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,279
[Applause]

00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,660
