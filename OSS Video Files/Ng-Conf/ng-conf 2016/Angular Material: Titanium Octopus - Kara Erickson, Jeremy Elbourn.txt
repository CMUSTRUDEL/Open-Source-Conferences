all right so thank you all for coming to

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,460
our talk on angular material we're

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,390
really excited to have you all here

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,370
today

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,570
you might be wondering about the title

00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,080
of the talk

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,600
titanium octopus

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,480
so I'm Jeremy L born I'm Keri Eriksen

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,640
and we work at Google on the angular

00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,860
team we work on angular material and

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:29,850
we're here today to tell you about the

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:31,260
new the exciting angular material - what

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,479
did we talk about we can't talk about

00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,850
angling material - yet not yet but I'm

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,890
so excited it's the new thing yeah I

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,540
know it's really exciting but most

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,680
people here is still using material 1 so

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,540
we need to give them an update first

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,750
you're right you're right we should

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,610
before we get into material to talk a

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,580
bit about the state of angular material

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,910
1 and the team is definitely still

00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,280
working very hard on angular material 1

00:01:53,910 --> 00:02:00,060
since the 1.0 release earlier this year

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,150
there have been over 450 commits for a

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,010
myriad of bug fixes and stability

00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,600
improvements and new features let's give

00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,209
them some of the highlights yeah so some

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,850
highlights we have this new MD color

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,530
service this is something that has been

00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,540
requested very frequently over the

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,820
lifespan of the library it gives you a

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,650
way of consuming the theme colors in

00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,980
your own application and in your own

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,630
components so you can build one solid

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,989
visual experience for the whole

00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:31,170
application now we also have coming soon

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:34,200
this new MD panel service this gives you

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,260
a really customizable and flexible way

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,930
of building components that deal with

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,540
opening some floating panel on the

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:46,560
screen things like dialogues and menus

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:48,269
pickers and tooltips all of your

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,180
components that follow this visual

00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:53,970
pattern can be built on top of this

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,980
panel service and it will deal for deal

00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,430
with for you positioning and

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,540
and staying inside the viewport so that

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,670
you don't have to deal with those

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,470
low-level concerns and eventually our

00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,060
own components will be moving to be

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,300
built on top of it so that they're much

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:12,400
more consistent and easy to maintain

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,290
another cool thing is that we've been

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,739
collaborating with the material design

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,810
team to build some example responsive

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,180
apps on angular material so here you can

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,730
see we have this example application

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,060
called pesto that is currently being

00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,709
rendered in the material design team's

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,799
resizer tool which shows the application

00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:35,079
both on desktop tablet and mobile all at

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,190
the same time and there are a handful of

00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:41,829
apps like this that really showcase

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:44,709
building a great-looking responsive app

00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:46,329
on top of angular material one and those

00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:49,060
are available on github we'll have a

00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:52,150
link for you later so all of this and

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,790
more is coming in our 1-1 oh release

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,340
that is coming soon and expect to see

00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,959
even more of these bug fixes stability

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,829
improvements and new features over the

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,560
next year for angular material 1 and so

00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:08,980
with that we get into the very exciting

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,299
and very new material too so sit back in

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,799
your chairs you might want to like

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:15,639
stretch a little because we have got a

00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,840
lot of bullet points ok to cover Jeremy

00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,609
we're not gonna do this we're gonna do a

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,760
live demo that's completely

00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:25,580
unplanned though ok so

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,920
before I got on stage I created an empty

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,290
starter we both angular CLI all I've

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,520
done at this point is IBM installed all

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,560
the material two components we're going

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,000
to be using today and updated the system

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,690
config and the buildconfig

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,290
to know about the new packages so if we

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:45,500
see that if we go ahead and ng ster here

00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:48,650
and that good but and oh hi Mike

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,690
so that ng serve is part of the angular

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,490
CLI that you're going to be able to

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,620
learn more about at another talk coming

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,010
up in the conference so you can see it

00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:00,220
just has this boilerplate text right now

00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,480
because this is an empty scaffold so

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,580
we're going to go ahead and add all of

00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:09,410
our material to imports at once here for

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:11,180
times sake and we're going to add our

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,250
directives that we'll be using

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,850
can add all the providers that we'll be

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,620
using and see that it still works all

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,590
right so so what kind of application are

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,330
we actually building here Kara okay so

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:27,080
this is an app idea I've had for a while

00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:31,670
it's a dating app for dogs I call it

00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:34,430
puppy love all right for for dogs like

00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:36,290
you like dog dogs yeah don't you want

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,520
your dog to be happy don't be selfish

00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:41,370
okay

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,599
so for our app here we're let's start

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,130
with the application scaffold so we're

00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:46,919
going to want to headline at the top and

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:51,660
a side nav that opens out on the left so

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:54,479
for our headline here we're going to use

00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,810
come on it called MD toolbar put in

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,789
puppy love and so caring a color

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,560
attribute on this toolbar to make it the

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:04,410
same to make it the themes primary color

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,639
comes with a theme by default but you

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,789
can customize that for your own

00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,340
application should see this nice primary

00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:12,990
theme color here and let's next add the

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,199
hamburger menu icons we can open the

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,300
side nav so a really easy way to add

00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,280
material design icons is using MD icon

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,889
if you have a material design font

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,720
loaded you can actually add the icons by

00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:27,990
ligature so if you just type menu here

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,409
you'll magically see that I don't have

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,409
an internet connection

00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:39,659
hold on oh let's see this works 10 plug

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,419
there we go

00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:44,219
okay and we're also going to want to

00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,300
wrap this in a button since we're

00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:47,310
actually going to be clicking on it to

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,629
open the side nap but that's going to

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,800
give us some of the default button

00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:53,039
styles which are going to kind of funny

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,439
so if we add MD icon button here we can

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,310
override those so it looks just the same

00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,590
right

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,900
now let's actually add our side nav

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,020
layout so as you might expect the

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:06,900
component for that is just oops

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:10,020
MD side nav layout we want it to be full

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:13,020
screen and then here you can just put it

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:15,629
inside the layout and then for the side

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,250
nav menu we just use MD sign up and if

00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:19,979
we tag it with a local template variable

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,509
like this we get access to its API so

00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,909
when we click the icon button we can

00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,680
just call side nabbed open yeah so it's

00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:27,839
it's really cool that angular 2 gives

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,550
you this template variable feature so

00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,629
you can wire up these components to

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,759
interact with each other with

00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:34,589
practically no code at all it's pretty

00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,599
straightforward right so we're going to

00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:38,669
add some navigation links in this side

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,800
up here so it has some content and we

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:41,699
can do that with something called MD

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,099
nablus

00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,509
so this MD LAN Atlas it gives you a way

00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,169
to quickly add a bunch of really

00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:51,419
good-looking anchors to your navigation

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,129
without really any boilerplate you can

00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:55,199
see that it's pretty customizable here

00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:57,029
we're adding two lines for every list

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,099
item one for the views name one of the

00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:02,339
views description we can also add an

00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:03,930
icon in here it also uses ligatures it's

00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,149
going to be backed by that view object

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,849
so if we add that view object to our

00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:11,129
type script here I have a snippet for

00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:12,629
this as well we have two links the my

00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:15,719
account link and the potential dates

00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:18,089
link so if we look at our app we have

00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:19,800
this beautiful list in our side now the

00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:21,120
bottom should really be secondary text

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,260
this I'm going to make it gray really

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,800
quick

00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:30,750
since I have time let's go ahead and

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,729
make the color right about that we go in

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:37,229
the HTML we can go ahead and add the

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:38,820
costs that I just created okay cool

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:40,530
looks a little bitter next we're going

00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,150
to add all of the profiles for our dog

00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:47,630
bachelors and bachelorettes

00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:51,450
so each dog is going to have a card so

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:54,180
dog dogs and each card is going to have

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:57,270
a card title that's going to have dog's

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,890
name and then each card is going to have

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,210
some card content we don't actually have

00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:04,910
a dog description right now so we're

00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,910
going to use Doh gypsum now and

00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:13,390
so go ahead and add the backing dogs

00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:18,190
object these are just the names of

00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:21,850
angular team dogs and in our CSS can add

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:24,160
Smith's material we'll do a lot of the

00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,780
CSS heavy lifting for you but they're

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,170
still going to be some styles that are

00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:31,420
specific to your application and so here

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,770
we're adding some width and some margins

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,810
to these cards so that they look right

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,160
in the application we're building

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,830
I also it's not going to background

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,210
color because it looks nice okay so we

00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,560
have all these cards they lined up in a

00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,060
column right now because cards are just

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,890
fill a block by default but we can make

00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,970
them wrap since we have more horizontal

00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:54,780
space so let's go ahead and add a card

00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:54,780
container here oops that's not right

00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:01,340
you can put our cards in that container

00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:03,380
and then in our CSS you can say we want

00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:07,780
the card container to be display flex

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,780
and we want it to be a row that wraps

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:14,870
okay cool so these are fine they look a

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:17,780
little spare we really need some images

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,510
some dug images so we can easily add

00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,870
images to our cards using an image tag

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:27,800
in an attribute called MD card image

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:30,490
outside text here the dog's name and our

00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,490
assets are here at the dog's name

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,490
oops

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,530
pretty dogs right hi Kara how did you

00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:46,640
get that photo of my dog don't worry

00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:48,890
about it okay so next we need to add

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,690
some actions so that when your dog sees

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:54,650
another dog that he or she likes they

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:58,130
can do something about it so we're gonna

00:10:54,650 --> 00:11:00,380
add an mg card actions section here and

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,970
so we can use MD button here because ou

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,220
make our button look a little nicer and

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,360
it has the same api's toolbar for your

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,120
theme so you could just add it the

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,150
primary color so you can sniff your

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,720
potential old date or you can woof at my

00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,290
heart so now we have these nice buttons

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,360
here on the bottom

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,920
I'd really like them to be aligned on

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,780
the on the end of the container though

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,200
so we can quickly add and align equals

00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,940
and then we have these nice buttons on

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,220
the end so we're starting to have a real

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,440
app here and the last thing we need

00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,030
though to make it a viable dating app is

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,750
the ability to create your own profile

00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:38,060
so we can add a form up here we have the

00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,680
container for that and this is also

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,380
going to be a card once again we need a

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,830
card title maybe create your dog's

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:47,060
profile and then in our car content

00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,640
we're just going to have a form it's

00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,400
empty for now fill it in a second and

00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,800
for our card actions probably someone

00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,030
post button so we're going to use MD

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,500
raise button here so you can see what

00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:01,220
that looks like and we're going to use

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:04,440
the accent color from our theme post and

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,839
once again slyness on hand

00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,790
okay so before we do anything I'm going

00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:16,680
to make that forum full width but it

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:18,430
looks a little nicer oops okay

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,470
all right

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,150
okay cool so we have this form it's

00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:26,380
completely empty let's add some text

00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:28,240
inputs and radio buttons to it so we

00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,760
have this cool component called MD input

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,440
that animates the placeholders and so

00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,840
for this one let's do a placeholder for

00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,760
the name maybe for the dog's favorite

00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,590
toy they love it

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,900
toy and then maybe one for the dog's

00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:46,990
description then I'm going to add

00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:49,270
another margin so our components don't

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,250
have any margins defined on the much

00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,780
like native components because the exact

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,460
spacing that you're going to need is

00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,100
again going to be dependent on your

00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,620
individual application sneaking in some

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,310
styles for the future here okay so now

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,420
we have these lovely inputs that animate

00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:08,260
let's go ahead and add some radio

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:11,050
buttons to make this look nicer so can

00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:16,410
add a radio group and a radio button for

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:22,530
each of these let's say looking for love

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:22,530
and then that's just browsing maybe

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,480
let's duplicate these here

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:37,570
equals okay

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:45,850
we have radio buttons and let's add a

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:47,140
checkbox or gloss it's a good and we're

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,520
going to make these are.this an

00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,020
indeterminate checkbox just so we can

00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,280
show you the animation here in the term

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,230
it just means that it's in a mixed

00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:59,890
true/false state if you look at the

00:13:53,230 --> 00:14:01,060
animation here it's pretty nice okay so

00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,500
it's a little weird that we have the

00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,390
form just always hanging out here on the

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,310
top so as our last action for this app

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:09,780
we're going to build a fab or a floating

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:13,150
action button to toggle this form so

00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:16,900
let's add a fab it can also wrap empty

00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:21,730
icons so I'm out here and click we'd

00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:23,200
like it to toggle some boolean and then

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:28,270
make sure that the form listens to that

00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:32,560
toggle or I'm showing in our types

00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:34,300
crafter need to actually add that so I'm

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,730
showing we're going to initialize it to

00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,950
false so it's initially hidden and

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,780
lastly lastly we're going to position

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,990
the button and for time reasons I'm just

00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,990
going to

00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,140
okay

00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:55,250
all right so you got this lovely file

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,060
button we've got forum you have cards

00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:01,910
you have a side nav and all of this is

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,560
oome out for a second it's been about 60

00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,560
lines of HTML in about 10 minutes

00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,550
all right so so now that we've

00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,260
completely blown you all away with our

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,810
flawless live demo

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,520
you're probably like really excited you

00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,710
want to like run out of this room and

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:31,870
start using this stuff like right now

00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:34,510
but don't don't stay here we have more

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,770
talking to do so what's going on what's

00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,970
the current state of these components it

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:43,900
looks pretty good right

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:46,120
so our alpha has begun oh yay we forgot

00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,800
we forgot to bring our confetti in the

00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,850
minute we don't have a confetti

00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,860
ah so alpha is begun does that mean you

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,740
can start using this well if you're

00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,780
about to start building a really large

00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:02,050
big production app that has to be really

00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,370
stable then it's probably going to not

00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,680
be the right fit for you right now we

00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:08,020
still have a lot to do before we can

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,870
launch we have more components to write

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,160
more tests infrastructure to deploy also

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,770
having talks would be nice yes

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,080
documentation is nice and something new

00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:19,630
that we are working on whoa whoa whoa

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,880
whoa hold on hold on just stop for a

00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,340
second I've got a question so this

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,850
sounds super amazing like angular

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:31,210
material - lovely but I've got my own

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:34,540
design language and I'm building my own

00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:37,180
site my dating site called okay hamster

00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,800
and what I want to know is what are you

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,580
doing for me let me rephrase it

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,590
what are you doing for me oh well thank

00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,830
you stranger for your completely

00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,990
unplanned don't don't stall get to the

00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:53,300
question what are you doing for me and

00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:55,910
an okay hamster question

00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,770
and we are absolutely going to be able

00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,480
to help you and that is what we're going

00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:03,440
to be talking about in this component

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:07,010
toolkit so let's get through some of

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:10,280
these points so more components as you

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:13,450
saw we have some of the basic components

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:18,680
in our alpha 4 which we just released

00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:20,530
last night around midnight 1 Anna we've

00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,480
got buttons radio buttons checkboxes

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,839
inputs so like that's it right we're

00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,540
good to go

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:30,710
well not quite we've made a lot of

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:33,710
progress but there's still a lot of

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:36,530
components that aren't there yet we

00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,260
still have to build dialogues de Pickers

00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:41,300
menu selects autocomplete so lots of

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,610
things still in the pipeline and it's

00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,560
not just new components that we're going

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,330
to be building it's also making sure

00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,280
that those components remain really

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:51,350
really high quality so we're looking at

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,910
what we can do in testing an automation

00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,490
to make that the case so one of the big

00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:59,030
things we're looking at there is screen

00:17:55,490 --> 00:18:00,950
shot tests this is where when ever any

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,440
commit comes in we are going to be able

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,870
to see a before and after and get a diff

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,000
like you see here in the middle of what

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,760
has changed and this is going to be

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,910
incredibly useful for keeping track of

00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:16,730
visual regressions that are really hard

00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:19,460
to catch with just unit and end-to-end

00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:21,320
tests these are great for subtle CSS

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,790
changes later otherwise miss like if

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:27,440
your baseline drops to pixels

00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:30,290
mysteriously yeah and this is going to

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,230
help us not break the components with

00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:35,450
small CSS changes that have accidently

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,730
too wide of an impact and it's not just

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,200
about being pixel perfect either it's

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,020
also very important that these

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,000
components are super fast so we're going

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,520
to be working on performance tests to

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,460
make sure that on every commit our

00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,230
metrics for how many components can load

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,520
on a page and a certain amount of time

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,960
or what kind of frames-per-second we're

00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,640
getting we're making sure that we don't

00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,850
see any regressions there and we're also

00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,860
going to be working on comparing with

00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,169
benchmarks to other component frameworks

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,880
to make sure we're staying competitive

00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:08,419
and we have some nice graphs here

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,730
because those are nice where we're

00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:12,980
constantly looking for new things to

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,020
test as well so in addition to the unit

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,730
and intend and the performance and

00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,340
screenshot tests we're also looking into

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:22,280
possibly doing accessibility audits on

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,860
our screen on our CI and possibly even

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,450
looking into tests that can make

00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,390
assertions based on what a screen reader

00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,679
is actually reading out loud and even

00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,780
more we're always trying to find new

00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,450
ways to automate quality into our

00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,970
process we mentioned earlier

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,640
documentation is also really nice to

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:43,520
have we have a lovely home for where

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,559
these documentation articles and API

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,260
Docs are going to live material that

00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:50,059
angular I oh we have this great splash

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:55,190
screen now unfortunately it's a little

00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:57,200
short on content and to answer the

00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:01,669
question of our mysterious stranger who

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:05,090
would answer the question who so rudely

00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:07,910
interrupted us earlier we're we're also

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,940
working on this concept of a component

00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:14,330
toolkit that will empower all of you to

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,549
build components of the of the caliber

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,890
that we're trying to build and this idea

00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,690
came about because as we've been working

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,820
on these components we found that a

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:26,299
large portion of our time coding goes

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,980
into building foundation that all of the

00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:31,010
material components are built on top of

00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,440
but isn't really coupled to material

00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,929
design either in visuals or behavior at

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,929
all and to give you an idea of the kinds

00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:40,760
of things that are going to be in this

00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:41,929
toolkit that we're imagining we'll go

00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,450
through some of the key things that

00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:47,900
we're already working on so the first is

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:50,510
this concept of overlays which again is

00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,809
for anything that opens up some floating

00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:55,230
panel things like menus and dialogues

00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:56,549
selects and tooltips

00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,610
and it's code that deals with the

00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:01,500
positioning of keeping panels on screen

00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:04,169
inside the viewport of what to do when

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,450
you're scrolling how to animate how do

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:09,299
you deal with accessibility and focus

00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:11,160
trapping well all of this is common for

00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:12,450
any kind of component library not just

00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,900
material so we want to make this

00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:18,150
available to people to to use to build

00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,890
their own components on we're also

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,990
building a number of utilities to help

00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,309
your app run flawlessly on mobile we've

00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,020
already built a customizable event

00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:26,190
plugin for gestures using camera j/s

00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,380
which is a popular gesture library

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,410
expect more gesture support in the form

00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,570
of fast click solution and custom

00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,220
recognizers like dragging we're also

00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,900
working on helpers for responsiveness so

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,020
that your app will easily adjusts to any

00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,270
screen size size and we also care deeply

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,799
about accessibility we already have an

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,750
initial version of an announcer service

00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:47,580
for screen readers and we're in the

00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,380
planning stages of a utility to manage

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,110
focus States across your application and

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,460
those are just some of the big key

00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,929
things we were working on there are also

00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,970
other things that we're looking into

00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:58,559
such as having virtual scrolling that

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,540
can be used in any kind of component

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,549
that's displaying a large list of items

00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,660
the selection model for anything where

00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:05,850
you're dealing with selecting multiple

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,890
items such as in a multi-select or a

00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:09,210
data table and some general testing

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,400
utilities to make your testing life

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,980
easier and what you're probably

00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,360
wondering is this all sounds great but

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,049
the first question everybody wants to

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,320
know is when when when as we heard so

00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:24,690
earlier everybody wants to know when so

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,410
let's take a look at our roadmap the

00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:30,630
first thing on our radar is our beta we

00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:33,450
are aiming for a mostly feature parity

00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:36,720
with angular material one for our beta

00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:39,110
which we are aiming to have sometime

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,790
this year in 2016

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,470
beyond our beta working on or we're

00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:46,110
planning a number of advanced components

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,929
like rich text editing or even really

00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:52,290
powerful data tables and traveling off

00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:54,570
into the future who knows what we are

00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:56,669
going to be doing we have some ideas

00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,710
about data visualization and building

00:22:56,669 --> 00:23:00,690
components that encapsulate an entire

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,730
application but really we want to hear

00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,680
feedback from all of you here in this

00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,540
room

00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,600
to that end we want you to follow our

00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:11,390
progress on github on twitter we have

00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,970
our links here for our repos we also

00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:16,330
have some links here for the design

00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:19,100
resources we talked about today those

00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:21,620
responsive sample apps and in a few

00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:24,470
minutes the source code for the app that

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,210
carol i've coded here on stage we want

00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,620
to also give a quick thank you to all of

00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,180
our contributors none of this would be

00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,130
possible without you we wouldn't be able

00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:35,720
to go as fast or build things as good

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:38,890
and it's all because of you so thank you

00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,890
that's all for us today

00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:43,700
