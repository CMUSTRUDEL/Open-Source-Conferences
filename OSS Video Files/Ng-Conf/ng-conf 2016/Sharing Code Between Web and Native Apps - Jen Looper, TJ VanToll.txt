if you can't stand the excellent so

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,529
thank you everybody we are sorry for the

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,780
awkward pause but we are super excited

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:12,750
to be here we are cooking up something

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,759
amazing for you today as you might be

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,920
able to tell by these amazing outfits

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,690
that we are sporting for you today we'll

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,910
be looking at how you can use angular to

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,350
the same angular 2 that you used to

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,570
build web apps the same angular 2 that

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,910
we're here today to talk about a native

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,939
script which we work on to build mobile

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,430
apps that run on the web as well as

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,000
native mobile apps that run on iOS and

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,010
Android

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,200
and how you can take this approach and

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,290
shares the same framework and even some

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,210
of the same code now I am chef TJ and as

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,280
you might be able to tell from my outfit

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,140
I have years of experience mixing and

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,530
matching code to build apps for various

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,390
mobile devices and I'm chef Jen and I've

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,789
created more tasty mobile apps than you

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,640
can shake a wooden spoon at so Jenna

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,109
what are we cooking up today we are

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,719
gonna be mixing up for you today a

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,210
groceries management app to show you

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,430
just how easy it is to share web and

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,689
native code so the idea is that we can

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,770
write something once and run it

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,210
everywhere we've been trying this for

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,689
years and it's worked really well so far

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,220
however this is one of the reasons that

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,140
people are so attracted to angular 2

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,520
plus our integration with native script

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,869
you could use the code that you've

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,790
already written for the web and you

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,060
leverage native scripts to build for

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:29,009
Android and iOS to create a truly native

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:31,170
mobile app with no webview in sight but

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,579
this begs the question especially to a

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,750
room of people that I believe are

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,880
probably how many people here consider

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,340
yourself a web developer in some way

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,650
shape or form so I see a good majority

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,869
of the hands going up I mean why build

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,270
for native at all well if you look at

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,250
actual data usage data out there and

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,040
this is some data that a guy from Google

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,159
kind of know of them Luke Wroblewski put

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,360
out he says native and wet the web each

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,740
have their own sort of unique

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,020
characteristics their own unique

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,759
advantages if you look at native for

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,770
instance as this chart shows people

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,719
spend a lot more time in native apps

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,140
almost 20 times more minutes in some

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,150
case

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,009
and this is really because native has

00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,100
the potential to build these really rich

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,480
really performant really compelling

00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,880
experiences that native is really known

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,400
for but of course that doesn't mean that

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,680
you shouldn't bill fit a web either the

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,720
web is known for its reach or its

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,330
ability to really run everywhere the web

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,700
isn't restricted by device type or

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,410
operating system the read runs

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,370
everywhere so it's a great way to reach

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,840
a large and diverse set of users so as

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,130
Luke Wroblewski has said and this is the

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,240
quote that everybody likes to pull up on

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,520
their slides so we're gonna do it for

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,680
you today the web is for audience reach

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,110
and native apps are for rich experiences

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,880
both are strategic both are valuable so

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,940
when it comes to mobile it's not web

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,170
versus native it's both but gen if we're

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,750
building for all three of these

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,390
platforms that's really hard oh my god

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,520
we have multiple code bases we have

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,430
three different platforms there are all

00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,810
these languages and IDs and how are we

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,270
gonna keep all these features in sync

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,610
what are we gonna do I don't know maybe

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,500
switch the slide okay all right we're

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,480
gonna take this good stuff we're gonna

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,340
mix it well and we're gonna take an

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,690
angular 2 code base mix it well with

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,540
native script and we're gonna get

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:21,180
angular native script some kind of mesh

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,010
of going on here okay so let's see how

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,290
all of this works today we have a

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,310
three-course meal prepared for you we're

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,930
gonna start with a bit of setup just

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,260
that we can see some of the special

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,360
considerations that your other inherent

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,670
to building from multiple platforms then

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,549
we'll build up a small native mobile app

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,600
so that you can see it all in action and

00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:41,790
finally we're gonna enter the discussion

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,700
of strategies for building your own apps

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,860
moving forward okay so I'm gonna set up

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,239
into some actual code here now there are

00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,220
many different ways that you could

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,410
structure your application web and

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,090
native you could use a single code base

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,830
you could use multiple code bases there

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,600
are various techniques for today's

00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,430
purposes what we'll be doing is showing

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,380
a web app and a native app side by side

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,720
just for demonstration purposes so it's

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,519
easier to see what's going on now what

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,739
we're gonna be building is this little

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,140
amazing grocery management app here you

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,870
can see super complex app where I can

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,720
login to my application and eventually

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,160
here I'll see

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,290
a list of groceries I or I will not see

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,960
a list of groceries let's see if I can

00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,810
do this

00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:27,460
alright we're seeing it now let me yeah

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,980
green low things up a little bit better

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,650
and go ahead and refresh here get these

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,180
things on the left and right hand side

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,280
of the screen so simple grocery

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,410
management say I can log into this

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,630
application and if the Wi-Fi is with me

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,220
today I will see a list of groceries so

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,720
we'll get back to how that works in a

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,970
minute now if we look at the code that

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,680
actually builds this up play the Wi-Fi

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,970
you'll come back here you'll see code

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,740
that looks like a lot of the code you've

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,800
seen today for angular 2 web apps you

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,230
see components and these angular 2 isms

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,120
and what we have right now we've started

00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,650
on our little native app that we'll be

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,690
building up during the course of this

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,520
presentation we'll try to get it to look

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,860
like this web app over here now there's

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,780
the full list that loaded up here and

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,760
currently what this looks like

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,220
is hello world so we'll bring these back

00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,440
up side-by-side well let's get started

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,290
with some mixing kneading and folding in

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,140
the UI so I see some extra HTML actually

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,880
in that web base for the web app and why

00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,260
don't we just like take a chunk of HTML

00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,130
and like slam it into the native code

00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,200
and see what happens

00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,270
yes so if you look at these code these

00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,919
facing side-by-side if if you've done

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,110
angular 2 before if you've even tinkered

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,669
with it you probably recognize most of

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,530
what you see on the right-hand side of

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:37,150
the screen here now the only thing

00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,770
that's going to look different for my

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,870
native app for my native script app here

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,220
is this label component this isn't

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,690
normally how you write labels for the

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,530
web right you write labels looking

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,750
something like this

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,910
where you put the text within it now the

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,580
reason that this label looks like this

00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,950
is in native script we are not using a

00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,130
webview this F here although basic there

00:05:53,950 --> 00:06:00,100
is no Dom here there is no HTML here so

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,510
I can't even take these divs and spans

00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,070
these things that are specific to the

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,500
browser and use them at my native script

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:08,979
app because there is no late there there

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,570
is no h1 for instance in the iOS SDK or

00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,320
the Android s these aren't things that

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,450
exist

00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,340
what we do in native script is we take

00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,440
these components for instance this label

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,100
and we render them with iOS and Android

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,560
specific code under the hood so

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,450
the we show the label here and I'm gonna

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,370
paste in a little more code just so we

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,530
build up this F and you can see a little

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,880
bit more of what this looks like so

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,470
instead of using things like divs and

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,330
spans you're using things that we can

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,310
translate into native code things like

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,570
stack layouts and text fields and

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,090
buttons to actually build up your

00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,460
application that looks fantastic looking

00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,020
better already um but since we're

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,760
looking at making the UI it looks

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,410
similar on both web and mobile apps

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,320
maybe we should take a look at some CSS

00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,880
I saw some some class what was it

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,350
calling class fields and that sort of

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,060
thing let's take a look at the CSS and

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,340
maybe we can share some code on that

00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,500
level now in native script remember we

00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,780
are building truly native applications

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,420
but one of the things we do provide is

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,880
the CSS syntax that works very much like

00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,290
the CSS that you use on the web you can

00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,420
see that the structure here looks pretty

00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,190
similar the the import statement you're

00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,170
selecting things by their tag name we

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,470
got some CSS class names even the name

00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,850
value pairs are similar as well the

00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,620
difference is in native script of what

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,570
we do is we actually take each of these

00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,160
individual rules and we convert these

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,710
into their native ios and android

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,720
equivalent so what that means is that

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,950
although you can use a lot of CSS code

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,440
you can see like for instance in this

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:33,390
file here and we can also do things like

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,190
I can do things at the angular level

00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,740
using things like this style URLs

00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,660
property and this code as well however

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,970
there are some CSS rules that we just

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,340
can't possibly replicate in iOS and

00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,960
Android land there's no real equivalent

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,760
or no real performant way you could make

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,360
the webs float for instance work on

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,560
Android or iOS but at the same time

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,030
think about the equivalent amount of

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,070
things you'd have to do in Xcode or

00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:58,470
Android studio to style these native

00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,820
controls it's a lot of mess and with by

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,410
sharing the same technique the same

00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,240
syntax you can get a lot done pretty

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,780
quickly using syntax that you're already

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,280
familiar with well it looks like we do

00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,610
have to make some compromises on the UI

00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,570
to support both web and mobile a native

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,400
submit of elements though we're

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,860
definitely able to share some structures

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,960
right so let's move into the real money

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,490
proposition now this is this I think is

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,200
actually the amount of code that you can

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,160
share on the service tier level so I'm

00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,050
guessing when you click this button

00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,550
you're gonna want something to happen

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,420
and

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,950
sort of call to a back-end to occur so

00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,660
we're going to show you how to share

00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,030
code on the service layer and I look at

00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:37,820
the service tier as a roo-hoo here who

00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:41,060
here cooks Julia Child's Oh awesome

00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,980
well so the roux is the base of three of

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,930
the mother sauces of French classical

00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,850
French cooking right with a good rue you

00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,680
can build a bechamel evaluatee and an

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,230
Espanola sauce right so we start with a

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,910
solid base and you create all kinds of

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,740
greatness on top of it so let's show the

00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,350
audience how we can share the service

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,090
tier intact between web and native yet

00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,100
if we take a look back and we again

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,870
compare our web and our native apps you

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,970
can see that so far there have been some

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,190
differences we've had to provide

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,440
different templates for our web and our

00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,390
native app our CSS isn't quite the same

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,680
but the service layer as Jenna was

00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,990
talking about is something that you can

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,030
pretty much share directly between your

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,220
web and native apps and in fact that's

00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:22,040
what we're doing in this example if I

00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,170
dive in here for this example what we're

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,270
doing is we literally have a shared

00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,880
folder that we just copied and pasted

00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:31,400
between these two apps now the reason

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,020
this is possible and the specific API

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,460
we're using here is a user service which

00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,370
is just a little service that we built

00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,020
for logging the users in and the reason

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,910
this works if you actually look at this

00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,890
class you can see we've written this in

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,230
a way that isn't tied to the UI at all

00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,940
you'll see that there's no iOS code here

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,520
there's no Android code here there's

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:53,060
also no browser there's no Dom code here

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,430
as well the reason this works is the

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,840
angular team has implemented this HTTP

00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,430
service if you were to look under the

00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,620
hood in the source code you'd find in

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,420
XML HTTP requests and all the various

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,880
web api is for implementing this code

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,160
what we've done with native script is

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,820
we've implemented these same api's for

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,550
the HTTP 8 8 TTP service but done so

00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:16,250
with iOS and Android native code to make

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,680
the same calls now why this is cool is

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,080
that you as a developer can use this

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,050
file and you don't need to care about

00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,730
where you're at this file just works out

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,650
of the box and you don't have to worry

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,600
about it and this is gonna work for more

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:32,030
than just in this is a simple example

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,620
that's hitting a restful api but we also

00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,360
have plug-ins for things like couch

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,950
based things like firebase some of these

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,240
services these back-end services that

00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,399
you may already be using

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,230
in your web apps that you can now bring

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,330
over into your native apps through

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,010
native script as well and what this code

00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,930
is actually doing just to show the code

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,990
that I pasted in here all I'm doing is

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,640
logging the user in and if things are

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,770
with us today all I should see when I

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,820
get back is a simple success just for

00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,990
now showing that we're hitting our

00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,810
back-end successfully

00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,700
fantastic all right we've got our

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,170
service here all set up and it seems to

00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,490
me now that you need to be able to click

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,260
that button and actually go somewhere

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,870
right you-know-who alerts on log in

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:11,360
maybe not so fabulous and it seems like

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,860
for this we need a router right so how

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,050
similar is the router setup between web

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,300
and native so if we we move back let's

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,490
bring our native or web app lower that

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,350
native in web app over here if you just

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,160
think for a moment about routing at a

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,140
high level

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,000
routing sort of by necessity needs to

00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:28,310
work a little bit different in a native

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,589
world versus a web world so in the web

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:32,390
over here you have things like the URL

00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:34,220
you have hashes you have a refresh

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,380
button back button all of these controls

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,209
that we know and love for the web in

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,770
native you don't necessarily have these

00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:42,470
things but you do have different

00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,570
navigation patterns like on Android you

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,829
have the hardware back button on iOS you

00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,270
have the little back button in the top

00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:49,520
corner yet the little gesture that you

00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:51,110
can swipe across to go back so what

00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,820
we've done in native script and I'm

00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,800
gonna do two things here I'm gonna paste

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:57,050
in a little more code and I'll explain

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,910
how this works in a minute but when I

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,770
mostly want to show is the code where we

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,209
set up the router on both of these

00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,910
ecosystems because I think it's really

00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:06,829
kind of cool to see visa side by side at

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,180
component here now if you look at these

00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:09,529
side by side again remembering this is

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,510
the web implementation this is the

00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:13,220
native implementation over here you can

00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,620
see the to the naked by naked eye these

00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,140
two look almost identical right there's

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,910
very few changes between the two now

00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,800
what is different if you've caught it

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:24,110
already is that in native script we're

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,360
using a router router outlet that we

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,730
wrote called a page router outlet which

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,529
basically just wraps the angular zone

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:33,079
router outlet that provides

00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:34,339
out-of-the-box way to do these or take

00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:36,440
advantage of these native capabilities

00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:39,230
things like the hardware back button

00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,149
such that you get two code to the same

00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,420
API stand see this this file is almost

00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:47,610
identical but you get the behavior if I

00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,680
go back to my my app here I can now sign

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,270
and if the Wi-Fi allows it to will go to

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,060
the next page and that the hardware back

00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:58,820
button will work out of the box so we'll

00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:01,260
see in a second okay good all right well

00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,150
we've talked about let's see we talked

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,420
about the UI we talked about the service

00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:08,940
tier we talked about the router um shall

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,220
I wait for you to sign in all right go

00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,440
ahead okay we're gonna moving on moving

00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,630
on um we're gonna add a little garnish

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,550
now let's talk about some of the pretty

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:19,140
details we can add on then on the native

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,000
side especially that we can make to make

00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,410
the user experience really great what

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,990
people love about their mobile apps is

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,310
that beautiful native user experience

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,860
that looks a little different maybe

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,810
across Android and iOS yeah so the Wi-Fi

00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,460
is betraying me here to show the actual

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,320
login the hardware back button would

00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,460
work but I can show one other thing on

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,310
the login page something that we

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,500
announced in our new native descript 2.0

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,140
releases that we support now CSS

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,490
animations that you can write using the

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,160
same code you'd write for the web and

00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,260
have them work in native apps as well so

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,510
what I have in this application here is

00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,400
we've got a little UI component grid

00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:55,770
layout that has a class of scale down

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,830
and what I'm gonna do with this is I'm

00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:00,540
gonna write a bit of CSS code in here

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,430
that actually takes this class name and

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,050
if you've worked with CSS animations

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,850
before the code you see here should look

00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,560
fairly familiar I'm gonna give this

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,810
thing a background image that points at

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,670
an image within my application I'm gonna

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,020
do a quick little scale animation so we

00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:16,020
just get a nice little background image

00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:17,340
that scales down as the app runs now

00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,230
what's cool about this is not only do

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,460
you get to use the same syntax that you

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,980
would use on the web to define your

00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,720
animations but remember these animations

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,300
when you're running in a native app are

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,460
running directly on the metal meaning

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,410
you can push these animations a lot

00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,940
further than you could in the web and

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,950
will show a few examples of that

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:38,610
momentarily it's very exciting to see

00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:39,900
CSS animations that you can use on it

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,790
within a native app that's really really

00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,400
awesome this is brand new for us so

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,140
really exciting what else can we make

00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,310
happen on this UI I'm sure we can have

00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,620
something really useful and user

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:52,140
friendly yes so we'll see if we can sign

00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,140
in stuff oh there we go there's a part

00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,000
of that

00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,830
so just to take a step back here to

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,269
discuss sort of where we're at we talked

00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,190
about some of the things that we can

00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:04,709
share and some of the things that don't

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,690
make as much sense to share but one of

00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:09,209
the things I really like to sort of

00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,769
encourage people is that if you're going

00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,570
through the hassle of building a native

00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:14,940
app right if you're gonna build an iOS

00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,920
or Android app it really behooves you to

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,320
take advantage of building for those

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,510
devices when you're I'm a native app you

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,160
can do a lot more than you can in on a

00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,110
web app you can think differently you

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,610
can do different things so you really

00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,769
don't want to think of your native app

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,420
is just like another image of your web

00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:33,120
app you want to think about the unique

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,610
things that native apps can do and just

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,290
to show like one quick idea so I know

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,260
everybody here is gonna want to pick up

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:42,120
an apron after we show this up so I'll

00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,560
add this to the list here one of the

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,029
things that native does out of the box

00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,160
really well is give you a pull to

00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:48,959
refresh so if you're in a web app to

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,790
implement that sort of UI you'd have to

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,279
bust out some virtual Dom hacks and some

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,440
sort of hacky Dom code in native land

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,000
it's basically a boolean right you just

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,680
get to turn on pull the refresh and

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,810
implement how you want that handler to

00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,640
work I mean there are other things you

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,260
can do as well imagine I could make this

00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,209
an endless rural grocery list this is

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,190
quite easy to do on native I could add

00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:09,690
swipe actions if I wanted the users to

00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,750
be able to swipe to delete from the list

00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:15,000
I could tie into the native share widget

00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,190
that is available on these devices so it

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,390
really makes sense to steer the stuff

00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,980
that makes sense things like the

00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,810
services the models the data that we

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,610
showed earlier but to take advantage of

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:27,390
the unique environments that you're

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:30,600
deploying to and so I have one final

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:33,000
example so everybody likes to end with a

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,770
bang so to really show that you are

00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,600
actually running on a native app here

00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,399
right you're not building on a web app I

00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,230
want to show at least one thing that you

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,490
just basically requires byte code to do

00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,490
that you're not really going to be able

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:47,130
to do the web and one of our native

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:50,040
script experts Brad Mardon wrote a

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,630
native script plug-in and it's name sort

00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,760
of is a very descriptive native script

00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,680
explosion field basically you just pass

00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:59,160
it the UI element and it makes it

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,350
explode it's a very practical I really

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,730
try to go plug absolutely so what I'm

00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,350
gonna do is this login function

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,490
currently is kind of boring right it

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,459
just logs the person

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,720
that is not a whole lot of fun so

00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,490
instead what I'm gonna do is make it

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,130
make a few things on the screen just

00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:16,079
explode because that is far more

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,480
interesting much better now what's cool

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,300
is that this plugin is actually using a

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,470
jar from android arsenal so one of the

00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,390
things we do with native script is we

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,890
also give you the ability to use some of

00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,260
the best things that native has to offer

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,630
things like cocoa pods and iOS jars from

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,460
android arsenal and to leverage them in

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,530
your native script app using javascript

00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,020
and typescript code that's sort of easy

00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:40,980
to use so now when I click this what's

00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,480
the logos gonna explode here boom and

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,970
then after that this is gonna explode

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,309
and then after a second or two we just

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,880
make the entire application explode just

00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:52,800
because that's sort of fun to do we just

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,030
sort of wrap it up this is just the the

00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,490
different ways you can think about

00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,600
designing your application share code

00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,910
that makes sense

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,320
things like services model data but then

00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,870
build the views to you can build the

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,550
best possible experiences for the users

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,780
for the apps that you're building and

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,390
with native script and angular 2 we

00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,360
think this makes a lot of this possible

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,950
it's very exciting so TJ I think it's

00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,600
time for my favorite time of day which

00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,210
is dessert sometimes I don't even bother

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,850
with the meal I just go for the dessert

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:22,350
not that one mmm yeah yes so what we

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,220
want to do is just um give you this

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,160
show-stopping

00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,020
cake essentially we want to point you in

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,820
the direction of this fantastic angular

00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,640
2 advanced seed that one of our fabulous

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:35,160
telluric developer experts has has

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,679
created for us Nathan Walker where are

00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:41,100
you he's been there his around here

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:45,030
somewhere he has created this easy way

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:47,190
to scaffold an angular 2 app + native

00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:49,050
script + desktop + space Nishant

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,820
whatever you need this will allow you to

00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,559
get up and running really quickly with

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,990
angular 2 + native script and it's

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,120
really really exciting and the last

00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:59,340
thing things I mentioned so we have a

variety of prizes I want to call special

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,350
attention to this native script this

00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,260
amazing native script angular shirt here

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,750

tomorrow Jenna and I will be giving a

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,240
two-hour deep dive in the native script

00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,890
we may even wear our aprons again so

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,809
