[Applause]

00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:09,360
well thank you so much it's a real honor

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,330
to be here this is a neurosurgeon I'm a

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,830
brain surgeon and I usually talked to

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,020
brain surgeons so this is a little bit

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,810
different audience than what am i used

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,439
to but I think the reason I'm here is

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,810
because you're interested in adjusting

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,349
programs and you work with software and

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,289
hardware and I do too my software and

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:35,480
hardware is the human brain and what I

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:38,070
do is I go into the brain and I adjust

00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,680
the circuits in the brain adjust the

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,579
activity circuits in the brain so some

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,500
circuits for example are underperforming

00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:50,430
their output is not is insufficient and

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,770
we're able to using electricity boost up

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,120
their activity so turn up the volume or

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,250
the gain on the circus and there are

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,170
other circuits that are misfiring mal

00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,670
firing causing trouble a good example

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,649
might be someone with an epilepsy or

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,750
someone who's hallucinating so there's a

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,450
successive abnormal activity in the

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,750
brain and we're able to go there and

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,060
turn it down using electricity again so

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,390
what I'm gonna tell you about today is

00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:18,960
really this idea of going anywhere in

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,150
the brain and adjusting the dials on

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,820
those brain circuits on those rein

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,420
functions and we don't do this in normal

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,579
people at least not yet but we do this

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,869
in people that have neurologic and

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:36,780
psychiatric illnesses and the concept is

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,030
really based on the idea that different

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,860
functions in the brain are localized in

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,540
the different circuits so for example

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,640
there's a circuit that controls their

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,560
movement another circuit that controls

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,149
your vision other circuits that control

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,250
your appetite whether you're hungry or

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,740
not this one is probably quite active

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,270
now so this is just before lunch there

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,820
are circuits that control your mood

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,290
whether you're happy or sad and their

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,689
circuits that control your memory and

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,979
your cognitive function so under normal

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,710
circumstances these circuits are

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,429
functioning well and you have the beauty

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,050
that is human life function but

00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:12,350
sometimes things go wrong in the brain

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,390
and these circuits don't work

00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,000
they should and that's when you start

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,560
getting a disease the signs and symptoms

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,970
of a disease so for example when that

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,530
circuit is a circuit involved in

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,180
movement you might get something like

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,680
Parkinson's disease which is a disorder

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,990
where movement is impaired

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,970
when the circuit is in the visual

00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,860
circuit then you you're you're blind or

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,170
you have impaired vision when it is

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,120
circuit that is for example appetite if

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,670
your appetite is a lot of control then

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,230
you might become obese for example if

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,680
it's a circuit that regulates your mood

00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:44,990
and is stuck on a sadness setting then

00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,490
you might become depressed and if it's a

00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,830
circuit that involves your memory that

00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,930
is dysfunctioning then this is of course

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,700
what characterizes Alzheimer's disease

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,470
so what I'm going to tell you about is

00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,450
going into these various circuits in the

00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,690
brain and adjusting their activity

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:01,400
turning them either up or down and we're

00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,380
going to do that using this technique

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,960
and this is called deep brain

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,000
stimulation and what this involves is

00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,520
the patients are awake and during the

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,730
surgery we freeze their skin we drill

00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,740
holes in their head one or two and then

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,150
we place these electrodes in their brain

00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,430
and we can place these electrodes

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,540
anywhere in the brain and it looks like

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,180
this so here's the electrode in the

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,640
brain and then underneath the skin we

00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,370
thread we tunnel this cable all the way

00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,110
down to a pacemaker here and through the

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,120
skin with a remote control very much

00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,580
like you would adjust the volume on your

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,240
television we are able to turn and

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,040
adjust how much current is delivered on

00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,380
an ongoing basis usually 24 hours a day

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,360
to these areas of the brain so basically

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,370
what we have to decide - is in which

00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,590
patient do we put these electrodes in

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,020
and where in the brain do these

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,850
electrodes go and in which circuit do we

00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,570
want to modify which circuit do we want

00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:58,370
to adjust the activity so this is what

00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,380
it looks like in an MRI so this is the

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,090
electrode in the in the brain and you

00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,440
see the contacts here so that's what it

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,150
looks like and that's what we're going

00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,920
to be talking about today so what I'll

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:11,090
do now is I'll give you some examples of

00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:13,250
how this works and we started this using

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,020
treating Parkinson's disease so as you

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,750
know Parkinson's disease is a disorder

00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:20,330
where you have tremor you have inability

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,890
to move very quickly so this is one of

00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:24,450
these patients with Parkinson's disease

00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,610
who has these electrodes in

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,230
their brain and I'm gonna show you what

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,020
she's like when we have the Machine off

00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,970
when the electrode is not on and this is

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,530
her normal Parkinson's state and then

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,570
we're gonna turn it on and you'll see

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,650
the effect of the electricity being

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,980
delivered to her brain

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,930
so it looks something like this a little

00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,410
touch my finger so you see that she has

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,410
some tremor

00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:59,810
we're gonna turn it on now it's on we

00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,810
just turned it on

00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:13,509
so this works instantly

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,509
[Applause]

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,580
the difference between having tremor and

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,560
not involves having 25,000 neurons in

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,990
the brain that are firing at tremor

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,220
synchrony and this this firing is

00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,630
transmitted all the way through the

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,000
motor circuit to the spinal cord into

00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,980
the muscles so if we use electricity to

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,380
say gentlemen that's enough we'd like

00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,480
you to stop firing like that then the

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,000
tremor goes away the reason I chose this

00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,560
video is an old videos from 1995 so as

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,250
you can see I was just a boy when this

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,850
was done and basically this is a lady

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:52,570
who has had this simulator on 24 hours a

00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:57,250
day since 1995 so that's about 21 years

00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:59,260
it is on at 130 impulses per second 130

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,960
Hertz so those of you are very good at

00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,730
math I am sure you are that's a billion

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,220
impulses that these neurons have

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:09,550
received in the brain and if you think

00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,140
of it even today so she's on her fifth

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,880
battery these batteries last about four

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,190
or five years so every four or five

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,710
years she comes in we have to freeze her

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:20,860
skin open take out the battery put in a

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:23,350
new one and close even now after all

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,240
this time as soon as we turn off the

00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,460
stimulation the tremor comes back

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,520
immediately despite these neurons having

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,810
received a billion impulses and as soon

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,780
as we turn on the simulation goes away

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:35,800
so these neurons are extremely

00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,590
recalcitrant they really keep their bad

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,260
habits seemingly forever and this is not

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,300
a cure but rather you need the ongoing

00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,920
application of electricity to suppress

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,230
these symptoms and what we're really

00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,180
doing is suppressing a pathological

00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,280
output in this particular circuit in the

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,050
brain that controls movement so that is

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,310
an example of using deep brain

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,590
stimulation to treat a movement disorder

00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:00,070
and to treat someone with Parkinson's

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:01,990
disease there's an even worse disorder

00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,610
which is called dystonia and this is a

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,560
disorder that affects children and

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,200
although their brains look perfectly

00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,420
normal they end up becoming very twisted

00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,970
they there they become paralyzed and

00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,010
twisted they can't move they can't walk

00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:18,310
and they die because of this disorder

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,990
and so the issue is could we also apply

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,270
this same kind of technique can we find

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,730
out what circuit is malfunctioning

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:26,680
causing these muscles to twist and can

00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,599
we intervene in that circuit and try to

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,270
turn it down

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,999
and see if that has an impact and so

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:36,779
back in 1997 I was asked to see this

00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:39,059
little boy who lives in Jerusalem and he

00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:41,639
has this dystonia and he was perfectly

00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:44,039
normal till the age of six and then

00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,959
within one year he became crippled with

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:51,330
the dystonia so let me show you what

00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:54,509
this looks up so you see how twisted his

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:57,539
arms and legs are and really within one

00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:59,369
year when he was seven he could no

00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:09,659
longer stand up he could no longer walk

00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:12,149
and became crippled like this propping

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:13,830
him up to stand him up and you can see

00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:16,289
how much difficulty he has because his

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,270
body is twisted his legs are twisted his

00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:21,990
arms are twisted in his trunk this

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:24,180
question so this is a boy this is a

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,889
genetic disorder there are eight

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,059
children in the family and five of them

00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,559
have this disorder

00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:31,229
so it's autosomal dominant so the

00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:34,469
dominant disorder and the only way this

00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:36,930
child could get around independently was

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:39,080
by dragging himself like this on the

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:41,539
floor

00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,800
so the natural history of this is that

00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:44,779
we expect this child to get worse and

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,440
worse and really to be dead within two

00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:50,120
or three years from the dystonia and the

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,070
question is really you know what what

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,589
can we do about this and you know back

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,269
then we did not know what what to do for

00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:57,860
this child we didn't know whether we

00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:00,709
should operate on him this had never

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,630
been done but we said let's take it

00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:05,120
let's take a shot at it we don't know if

00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:07,310
this is going to work but it's worth a

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,060
shot because it's almost inevitable you

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:12,950
know the the the the drawing is is is on

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,510
the wall as to what's going to happen in

00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,910
this way so we decided to put electrodes

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:19,190
in his brain into this motor circuit to

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,230
see if we could influence the motor

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,670
circuit and not knowing whether this

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,740
would work not knowing what other would

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,600
he say so he we did this operation he

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,089
then went home back to Israel and then

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,630
they sent me this video three months

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:31,630
after the surgery

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,759
[Applause]

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:51,220
so this boy is now 26 days married he

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,320
went to university and he's had you know

00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,930
a normal life I've now operated on three

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,450
of his brothers and sisters as well who

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:00,790
have the same disorder and perfectly

00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,160
normal kid in terms of intelligence and

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,900
this is all related to the neurons in

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,000
the brain that are misbehaving and

00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,370
causing the sending signals to the body

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,380
to twist and if we find out these where

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,810
these neurons are and use electricity to

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,730
tame them then we can get this kind of

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,470
result and really this is extremely

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,600
satisfying case for the most satisfying

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,550
case of my career and you know this

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,900
operation is now done all over the world

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,640
there have been hundreds of children now

00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,740
that have received this operation so

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,660
that I think that we can really say that

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:34,210
we've had an impact on this kind of

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:37,470
disorder so those are examples of motor

00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:40,000
disorders and with the success of

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,880
surgery for movement disorders like

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,830
dystonia and so on then one can imagine

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,500
that you might be able to apply this to

00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:50,920
other disorders and indeed there are now

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:52,870
a list of about 30 disorders where DBS

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,310
is being looked at where we are

00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,050
introducing electrodes in different

00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,280
circuits of the brain to see if we can

00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,640
help other things and there are things

00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,740
like depression like

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,660
obsessive-compulsive disorder like

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,020
Alzheimer's disease like drug addiction

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:11,680
can we turn off the urge for for drugs

00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:14,970
for alcohol for nicotine can we treat

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,640
cluster headache can we treat anorexia

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,860
chronic pain people who have Tourette's

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,420
syndrome people who have a traumatic

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,760
brain injury people who are in a coma

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,000
are we able to use electricity to wake

00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,590
up the brain to turn the brain back on

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,930
people with obesity are we able to place

00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,400
electrodes in the brain to tame appetite

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,950
so these are all the various things that

00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,710
are now being looked at in terms of

00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:41,520
where their DBS could be used to apply

00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:44,440
within these circuits to influence these

00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:47,260
disorders so the next disorder that we

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,870
took on was depression and this is based

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,400
on this finding we looked at what is

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,900
different in the brain of people with

00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,790
depression compared to normal patients

00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,530
and what we found is that there's some

00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,450
areas of the brain that are overactive

00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,160
and other areas that are under active in

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,960
depression so this is a PET scan a

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,930
positron emission tomography scan which

00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,450
measures blood flow and the areas in red

00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:11,150
are areas that have more blood flow than

00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,950
normal and the areas in blue are the

00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,450
areas that have less blood flow than

00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,700
normal so the way the brain works is

00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,920
that when neurons are active they they

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,140
draw in blood flow so there's a coupling

00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,150
between neurologic activity and and

00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,680
blood flow and so in patients with

00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,930
depression the theory of the brain

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,690
called area 25 they're all numbered soar

00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:31,010
like a paint paint by color schema so

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,330
they're all numbered and this area of

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,850
the brain called area 25 is a

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,920
hyperactive turns out that area 25 is

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,050
the sadness center in the brain so

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,350
basically your sadness center is on

00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:45,200
overdrive you're stuck in a hyper sad

00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:47,000
mode and when you're depressed and the

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,100
other is the brain and blue are shut

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,390
down so these are frontal the frontal

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,640
lobes either areas involved in

00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,320
motivation and drive and decision-making

00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,750
so people who are severely depressed

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,730
cannot make decisions there they lack

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,260
motivation they're apathetic and so

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,580
basically we found that there's a

00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,170
signature in the brain there are areas

00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,990
there's circuits in the brain that are

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,240
overactive or underactive so we decided

00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,440
to tackle this in patients with severe

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,840
depression these are patients who have

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,880
been ill for years who've tried all the

00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,250
drugs have even tried electro convulsive

00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,750
therapy that's shock therapy and are

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,940
still severely depressed and what we

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:22,280
decided to do was to place electrodes in

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,170
this area here area 25 to see if we

00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,050
could turn it down and to see whether

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,220
that would have any effect so indeed

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,920
what we were able to show is that

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,840
baseline area 25 is high and we are able

00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,280
to drive it down so that it starts at

00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,870
red and then three months later or a

00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,850
year later you see that it goes down to

00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,970
blue in fact we overshoot we turn it

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,470
down too much and the areas in blue that

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,730
were shut down before the frontal lobes

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,490
come back online you see if they're

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,260
right over here so the issue then is

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,640
we're able to correct this circuit

00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,440
malfunction in the brain and it turns

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,330
out that about 60% of the patients under

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,040
whom we do this get better and let me

00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,890
show you what this looks like so here's

00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,040
a lady who's in her 40s who's severely

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,780
depressed has had ECT who comes in to

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,520
the hospital we put these electrodes in

00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,020
but then we send her home without any

00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,660
stimulation we ask her what's it like at

00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:12,240
home without

00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:18,720
electricity see non-relative I thought a

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:25,949
lot better and more confident I could

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:30,959
see a future but as we boil and probably

00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:34,279
about midweek I've done it at my very

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,279
worst of

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,699
my depression was right down there at

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:43,500
the bottom

00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:46,500
could it elongate myself too

00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:50,280
get up and do anything just peed on

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:53,990
myself I need to get some things done

00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,990
around the house and I

00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:02,360
so this lady basically spent the entire

00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:03,769
day sitting in her couch looking outside

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,230
the window she couldn't get anything

00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,819
done because of her severe depression we

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:30,800
turned on the stimulator and a year

00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:33,819
later this is what she's like she opened

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,819
up a cat hotel

00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:42,840
[Music]

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:47,140
looking back this sector years were

00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:58,360
totally in the case of depression right

00:15:47,140 --> 00:16:02,700
idea was it syllable eyes organize

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,700
things now I enjoy I've made

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,350
so basically these disorders like

00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,420
depression are brain disorders they're

00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,970
circuit malfunction disorders areas of

00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,070
the brain are malfunctioning and we can

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,200
go into these circuits and we can tune

00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,510
them and in many cases we can improve

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,850
function so this is now in a phase 3

00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,170
clinical trial and this if this proves

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,570
to be safe and effective this could

00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,980
become a new therapy for patients with

00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,500
severe depression that have failed all

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,390
other treatments and who are still

00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,550
disabled so this is something that we'll

00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:44,240
see if it becomes a reality in the

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:47,150
largest-scale so I've shown you so far

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,710
that we can apply DBS into circuits that

00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:52,490
control movement circuits that control

00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:56,060
mood could we use DBS to make you

00:16:52,490 --> 00:17:00,529
thinner and smarter and anybody

00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:04,679
interested in any of that here

00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:07,230
so this was an accident going to tell

00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,959
you about an accident that occurred or

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:13,230
something serendipitous that occurred so

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:17,579
we were asked to treat a patient with

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:20,610
severe obesity a man who weighed over

00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:22,919
400 pounds and we started you know

00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:25,079
looking at what where where in the brain

00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,329
can we put electrodes in to turn down

00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,889
appetite so start looking in the

00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:30,870
literature look at the animal literature

00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:32,789
and sure enough there are experiments

00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,100
out there in monkeys and in rats and

00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:39,710
cats where there areas of the brain and

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:42,899
the hypothalamus where you can burn

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,429
areas of the brain destroy them and it

00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:46,380
causes a change in appetite so for

00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:47,940
example in this in this example here

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,389
this is the ventromedial hypothalamus

00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,860
near the midline and if you burn the

00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:55,320
ventromedial hypothalamus on both lines

00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,820
so if you destroy it this is the satiety

00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,380
center this is the area of the brain

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,899
that tells you you're satisfied to stop

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,490
eating so if you destroy that then you

00:18:00,899 --> 00:18:03,990
no longer get the sensation that you

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,360
should stop eating and you keep on

00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:08,370
eating forever incessantly and you end

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,220
up looking something like this cat does

00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:14,010
here right on the other hand they're

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,200
also a nuclei that are hunger nuclei and

00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,870
if you destroy those then you're no

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,279
longer hungry and then you don't eat and

00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,309
then you end up looking like a cat like

00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,929
this so we thought why don't we put

00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:27,960
electrodes in these areas of the brain

00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:30,870
in humans and in a human and see if we

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,330
can suppress their appetite see if we

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,730
can increase their sensation of fullness

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,710
of satiety or can we suppress their

00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,779
sensation of hunger so we got permission

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,639
to do this and one patient after a

00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:44,610
year-and-a-half of negotiating with our

00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:47,309
ethical committee and we they give us

00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,570
permission to operate on one patient so

00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:50,250
they had a lot of confidence in us

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:52,649
obviously so they give us a one

00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,320
permission one patient and basically

00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:57,809
this is a patient who ate 420 pounds who

00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:01,289
had been obese since teenagehood

00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:03,809
and the way these operations are done

00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:05,909
the patients are awake and we are

00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,590
putting electrodes in his brain and as

00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:08,620
we advance the electrode in his brain

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,260
we're turning on the

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,090
city and we're looking for a spot in

00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,790
this brain where his appetite goes down

00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,820
so we asked him how hungry are you from

00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:21,430
zero to ten so his answer nine point

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,960
eight right that's as a baseline answer

00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:25,059
and we're putting the electrode in

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,100
turning on the electricity to see

00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:28,840
whether it goes from nine point eight to

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,400
something less than nine point eight and

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,250
that would tell us aha we're in the

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,690
right place so Rica right so we're doing

00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,400
this in the operating room we turn it on

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:39,850
at three volts and the first thing he

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:43,890
says he says I'm twenty years old

00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:46,570
I said what you're 53 he says no no I

00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:49,030
I'm 20 years old I'm in a scene and I'm

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,410
20 years old well what are you doing he

00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,679
says I don't know it's all in black and

00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:56,020
white it's all foggy we decide to

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,440
increase the current from three volts to

00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,440
five volts

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:06,369
now the details come in oh yeah I'm 20

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:07,960
years old and I'm walking through a

00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:10,029
field with my girlfriend and this is

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,129
what she's wearing it's in color it's a

00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:14,230
sunny day he could tell me all the

00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:17,919
richness of the details of this of the

00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:21,100
scene so we very almost immediately

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,110
forgot about this apatite stuff and we

00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,239
started concentrating on the memory and

00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,409
indeed we weren't able to really find a

00:20:25,239 --> 00:20:28,509
place where we could suppress his

00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:29,980
appetite so so we were able to find this

00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:32,289
these places where we could go and get

00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,940
these beautiful memories from past that

00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:36,190
we weren't able to get get the objects

00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,929
so it turns out that we we do this

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,749
operation we leave the electrodes in and

00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:42,399
then we send them home at a low voltage

00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:44,529
because you know we didn't want to send

00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:45,999
him home thinking he was 20 and had a

00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:49,179
beautiful girlfriend we thought that was

00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:51,700
inappropriate so so instead we send him

00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:53,679
home with it at a low setting so that he

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,679
couldn't tell whether it was on or off

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,019
alright okay so he goes home and then he

00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,639
comes back a month later and we do this

00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:03,489
neuropsychological testing at baseline

00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:05,679
and at one at one month later it turns

00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:08,470
out that his ability to remember things

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,450
shoots through the roof his ability to

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,980
remember lists of words like we give him

00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,929
20 words and he can just recite them

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,629
right back you know he could never do

00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:19,149
that before so basically we have a huge

00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:20,799
increase in his verbal memory as a

00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:24,789
consequence of turning on this

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:26,529
stimulator at a very low level so from

00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:28,179
this experiment we figured the three

00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:30,039
things number one that we're able to

00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:31,899
reach the circuits in the brain that are

00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,789
responsible for memory and that we're

00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:35,019
able to use electricity to drive them

00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:37,239
and increase their function and

00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:39,279
immediately that gave me the idea why

00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:40,929
don't we do this in people who have

00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,090
memory problems why don't we do this in

00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:45,100
patients with Alzheimer's disease so

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,989
that was the the idea for Alzheimer so

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,960
we started off with obesity ended up

00:21:46,989 --> 00:21:52,149
doing experience for Alzheimer's so we

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,769
published this paper about we can

00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:55,149
enhance memory by since the immunity of

00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:57,369
the hypothalamus in the fornix that's

00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:59,200
where we put the electrodes and the next

00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:01,629
day this was picked up by all the media

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,489
my friend was at the airport in in

00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:05,590
London he said this is the front page of

00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:07,659
the independent scientists discover way

00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,690
to reverse lost memory I thought this is

00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:12,649
a slight overstatement

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,649
but

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,490
but this this this this made the media

00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,560
we were in Google and you know 300

00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,020
newspapers covered this this story about

00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,500
the single obese man who could suddenly

00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,640
remember everything right and so turns

00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,440
out nothing much happened for a few

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,780
months and then someone sent me this so

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,480
they sent me a cartoon from France and

00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,070
this is a cartoon about a secret agent

00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,990
it's sort of like a Jason Bourne thing

00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:39,630
it's some secret agent who gets involved

00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,400
in some kind of accident and he becomes

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,020
totally amnestic doesn't know who he is

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,930
doesn't know his name anything like that

00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:48,270
so of course he seeks help for this and

00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,890
he he goes to see a psychiatrist and

00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,780
psychotherapist and he says you know I

00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:54,000
don't know who I am I've lost my entire

00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,340
memory you know can you help me she said

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,170
sorry you're out of luck I can't I can't

00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,600
do anything for you but as he's walking

00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:05,640
out she says but there's a neurosurgeon

00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:08,100
in Toronto who's discovered this way of

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,580
reversing memory so why don't you go see

00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,930
him right so so sure enough so I don't

00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:17,850
particularly like the way they depict

00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:20,040
him but but anyway they didn't go to

00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:22,320
Toronto and you know he does go under

00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,210
they have this operation done and they

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,680
turn on the simulation and then it he

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,600
goes back to the time when he was eight

00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,190
years old and he remembers his name and

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,860
everything you know everything comes

00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,540
back in place right so the wonders of

00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,030
neuro surgery they were able to cure

00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:38,250
them turns out that also this has made

00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:40,290
it to house m.d. so as you know houses

00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,330
this cantankerous guy and house has

00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:44,130
forgotten this crucial element in the

00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,170
history of a patient and without that

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,880
piece of data the patient's going to die

00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:54,040
right so what is house to do

00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,040
I won't go through the details but

00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:59,009
the house remembers exactly the right

00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,320
scene the right time place house can

00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:03,149
travel in time to exactly the right

00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,849
moment remember the scene and of course

00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:08,159
cure cure this girl from from this

00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:10,349
terrible faith so two things I cannot

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,269
exactly choose which memory is going to

00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:14,009
come up when I turn this thing on I

00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:16,229
cannot travel to the exact point in time

00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:21,090
and be specific and secondly I don't get

00:24:16,229 --> 00:24:22,710
any royalties from from this as well but

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,450
that was the idea basically on this on

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,820
this obese man that was the idea on

00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,229
which to start trying to see whether

00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,789
this could be useful in treating

00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:31,409
patients with Alzheimer's disease and so

00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:33,059
we started treating patients with

00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:34,619
Alzheimer's disease and the idea here is

00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:36,330
that in Alzheimer's disease it's a

00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:38,340
disease that eats away at this circuit

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,080
in the brain and the circuit starts to

00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,669
malfunction and then you get the signs

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,349
and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease so

00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:44,970
what we want to do is we want to put

00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:47,039
electrodes to stimulate this circuit

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,779
this is the fornix this is the structure

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,970
we're interested in and we put the

00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:52,529
electrode here and then we hook it up to

00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,749
the pit the battery and we try to

00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:56,070
stimulate this circuit and it looks

00:24:54,749 --> 00:24:57,179
something like that so this is the first

00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,129
human being in the world with

00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,799
Alzheimer's disease with an electrode in

00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:03,119
the brain and this is what this is not

00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,379
house now this is the real thing okay so

00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,210
this is now a real patient with

00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:07,139
Alzheimer's in the operating room and

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,529
this is what it looks like so this

00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:13,409
lady's 63 though the patients are awake

00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:14,700
to be flowing into Moira's brain where

00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:18,139
we're gonna turn this machine on you

00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,139
tell us if you feel anything okay

00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,890
it looks like there's a group of people

00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:27,930
right there's some people I believe that

00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:32,460
they're people but I can't say for sure

00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:33,090
anybody you recognize well it's hard to

00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,340
tell

00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:37,940
gordito yeah is this like a new scene or

00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:40,770
is it a scene from your past

00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,720
jeepers so this is that al all alone

00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:45,470
different thing you've seen before or

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,470
something brand-new

00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:53,740
I mean with a few more volts applied

00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:57,279
remarkably the details of the image gets

00:25:53,740 --> 00:26:00,549
sharper she lived in this palatial place

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:03,000
in Scotland where from deep within

00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:06,179
lawyers bring a childhood memory

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,159
surfaces we just had all kinds of

00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:11,259
planned to run around so you just that

00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:14,309
just came into your your line I saw that

00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:20,049
because the the way that the picture is

00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:23,049
it's okay I'm pretty sure it's a thing

00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:26,139
of my sister and my brother this vivid

00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:28,720
memory flash is a sign that Lozano has

00:26:26,139 --> 00:26:31,000
hit the spot I think it's very

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,710
suggestive that we're in the right place

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,629
that we're in a circuit of the brain

00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,789
that regulates memory and that we're

00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:39,059
able to tap into it we hope that this

00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:41,710
then translates into being able to

00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:43,899
activate this circuit and to boost up

00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:46,899
its function and this in turn will lead

00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:49,149
to an improvement in in memory and

00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:51,039
cognitive function so we see this

00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,450
phenomenon in roughly a third of the

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,559
patients where we stimulate the circuits

00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,840
in the brain and they get these vivid

00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:58,240
memories often from their childhood that

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,190
come out now in Alzheimer's one of the

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,419
problems is that the brain shuts down

00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,639
and their areas of the brain that no

00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:06,070
longer use glucose have no longer burned

00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:08,200
fuel and that is seen in the top figure

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,429
in blue these are the areas and brain in

00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,549
the brain this is a fluorodeoxyglucose

00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:13,659
PET scan and these are the areas in the

00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:15,909
brain and Alzheimer's disease that are

00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:17,320
shut down and what we've been able to

00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:19,240
show is that by turning on the

00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,129
electricity we're able to turn these

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,769
areas back on we're able to convince

00:27:21,129 --> 00:27:25,360
them to use glucose once again so we

00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:27,580
find that this is very exciting because

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,230
when the brain is not using glucose that

00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,730
is shut down it's not working and we

00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,259
think that a part of Alzheimer's disease

00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:33,879
might be reversible we might be able to

00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:35,950
turn these areas of brain back on and

00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:38,019
get them to function again and this is

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:40,539
analogous to having a power failure sort

00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:42,340
of in an area of the brain where their

00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:44,110
lights are out in an area of the brain

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,539
and the question is are the lights out

00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,279
forever can they be turned back on and

00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,990
it looks like indeed they can be turned

00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:51,789
back on so we think this is very

00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,409
exciting because it might mean that we

00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:55,899
might be able to reverse some of the

00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:57,420
aspects of Alzheimer's disease and get

00:27:55,899 --> 00:27:59,549
areas of the brain that have been shut

00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:03,720
by the disease to once again come back

00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:05,010
to life it turns out that in Alzheimer's

00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,280
disease your brain is being eaten away

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,960
and as you progress from zero to three

00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,640
years to six years to nine years in the

00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,870
illness your brain is shrinking and just

00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,549
being eaten away in this part of the

00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,470
brain called the hippocampus and the

00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:18,929
temporal lobe is shrinking away and as

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:20,640
it shrinks then your memory function in

00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:23,429
gets impaired so here you can't remember

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,200
people's names here you get lost you you

00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:27,929
can't be left alone in your house here

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,190
when it's severe you would not for

00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:31,830
example be able to recognize your

00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:34,830
children so as you lose more and more of

00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:37,049
this circuit your brain circuit then

00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,030
your memory function deteriorates what

00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,200
we've discovered purely by chance is

00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:42,360
that when we stimulate the circuit of

00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,770
the brain for a year instead of it's

00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,320
shrinking we can actually get it to grow

00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,669
so this is an MRI showing before the

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,190
operation and this is the hippocampus

00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:51,270
here and then a year after in fact I

00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,980
don't know if you can tell but it's

00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,780
actually gotten a little bit fatter and

00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,160
this is this is unheard of in

00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,260
Alzheimer's disease that you can get the

00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,210
brain to grow because normally the brain

00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,130
shrinks so in fact it looks like we can

00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:04,169
get the brain to grow and how could this

00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,970
be well it turns out that if you

00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:08,190
stimulate the same circuit in an animal

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,510
you produce growth factors so growth

00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,850
factors like brain derived neurotrophic

00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:14,309
factor or vgf if you stimulate and wait

00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,960
two hours you see a big rise in growth

00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:17,250
factor so it looks like by stimulating

00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,080
this circuit in the brain we're

00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,549
releasing trophic factors and the troca

00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,850
factors are like vitamins if you like

00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:26,100
and they make neurons grow and we can

00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,840
see that in that we can see neurons that

00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,760
are growing with deep brain stimulation

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,990
here's a normal neuron and here's a

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,970
neuron that's been stimulate you see

00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,929
that there are more branches which means

00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,480
that the brain is making more

00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:38,520
connections and in addition it looks

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,710
like we're making more neurons so this

00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,350
is the the hippocampus again every time

00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,480
a new cell is born in this experiment it

00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:47,370
turns red when we stimulate we can make

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,260
more neurons in the brain to make three

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:51,809
times more neurons we can grow more

00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,880
nerve cells so this is very exciting

00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:55,950
because using electricity we can

00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,390
repopulate areas of the brain that are

00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,830
damaged it means that we might be able

00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:00,960
to reconstruct circuits in the brain

00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:03,299
that are damaged and so it's clear that

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,280
not only do we have an effect on the

00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,720
function of the brain on the software

00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,490
the brain but we also have an effect on

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,470
the hardware of the brain because we're

00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,930
able to make more neurons these neurons

00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,490
are able to make

00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:15,040
more connections and we think that this

00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:18,390
then will lead to improved function in

00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:21,850
the circus and hopefully in our patients

00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:23,470
so in conclusion then there is a large

00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,730
unmet need there are millions and

00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:27,910
millions of patients with these

00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:29,680
disorders throughout the world and for

00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,180
example in in the United States there

00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,670
are six million people with Alzheimer's

00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:36,370
disease nine percent of the population

00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:38,140
is depressed 1 million people with outs

00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:39,340
with Parkinson's disease so there are

00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,280
millions of people with these disorders

00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:44,320
and so far we are not very good at

00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,640
treating them and certainly we there's

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,800
nothing that we can do to put the brakes

00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,170
on these disorders so we need novel

00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,940
interventions and it looks like using

00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:53,590
these circuits in the brain and applying

00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,810
electricity can not only change the

00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:58,240
activity of circuit that might also have

00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:59,350
a role in repairing some of these

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,300
circuits that are damaged and maybe

00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,330
making more neurons repopulating these

00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,710
circuits it is clear that no area of the

00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,320
brain is safe from neurosurgeons we can

00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:10,480
go just about anywhere in the brain we

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,870
it is safe these procedures are

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,250
extremely safe and we can really go

00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,570
anywhere we just have to know where to

00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,150
go we just have to have a strong

00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:21,010
rationale for going I've shown you

00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,750
examples of intervening and circuits

00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:24,580
that control movement I've shown you

00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,590
examples of circuits that control mood

00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,930
and then also circuits that control

00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,820
memory function but indeed any function

00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,520
of the brain could be modulated could be

00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,660
adjusted using electrical means so I

00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,180
first see that there's going to be a

00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,250
large expansion of indications and many

00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,480
more patients that might be helped for

00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,000
me one of the most exciting things is

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,680
the fact that we work with teams of

00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,590
people in multiple disciplines so we

00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,970
work with engineers we work with

00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:50,560
computer scientists we work on brain

00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:53,590
machine interfaces having the brain

00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,120
eventually talk to a machine having you

00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,010
know being able to download upload

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,150
information into and out of the brain

00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,950
this is something that's going to come

00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:02,110
in the future and it's working with

00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,850
people like you that's gonna make that

00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:06,190
happen where there'll be an interface

00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,570
that between a computer and a brain so

00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,460
that there can be the flow of

00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,500
information back and forth I think this

00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,540
is going to come in the years to come

00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,310
and really working with all these people

00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:17,920
together to build something that none of

00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:19,930
us could do by ourselves and the hope is

00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,270
that if we all work together that we

00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:24,100
will be able to help many more people

00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,590
and so with that I would like to thank

00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,419
you

00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:30,110
for your attention and thank you for the

00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:33,600
pleasure of being here thank you

00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,600
[Applause]
