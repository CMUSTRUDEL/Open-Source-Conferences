you tired of online videos like these

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:26,070
before we learn about angular 2 our

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:29,039
drain starla Windows XP introducing high

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,780

that will make you laugh while learning

00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,059
your favorite angular material in the

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,430
bestest way possible stop getting bored

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:42,650
and frustrated then start having the

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,650
time of your life learning angular

00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,610
really curious what talk was I get next

oh I'm a family guy I'm at GTE a Google

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:08,929
developer expert worldwide public

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:11,799
speaker and the president of Albania and

00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:17,780
I'm a serial wedding crasher okay and

00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:18,620
this is not Photoshop I really don't

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,510
know these people

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:26,360
okay so today's story is about

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:29,349
developers and emotions two words that

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:38,480
usually go together like dogs and

00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:40,040
eyebrow pencils they don't so but

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,459
there's one thing that makes them go

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:47,090
together and that thing is angular 2

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:53,239
angular angular 2 angular 2.0 angular 2

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:59,900
yes angular 2 its first I got mentioned

00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:03,950
in a Google group post back in May 2013

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:07,480
and ever since then we started a journey

00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:13,010
and emotional journey towards angular 2

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:16,100
and let's let's let's see the first

00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:18,500
emotion that we had in this journey the

00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,590
first one was excitement and why

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:25,069
excitement you asked frankly because we

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:27,010
love the angular team and the first

00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:30,650
people that we fell in love with were

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:32,840
bread Igor and of course angular's

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:36,230
create or misko hevery

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,329
and we love misko so much that we let

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,140
him get away with calling himself the

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,360
father of angular on his Twitter account

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,209
heck we love you so much he can call

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,709
himself Mishka mother of dragons and we

00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:53,170
still work over there but so we love

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,600
Mishka so much when he get excited about

00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:58,330
about something we all get excited about

00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,990
it and this is what he had to say about

00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,640
angular 2 I've been so excited about

00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,990
angular 2 everybody who will listen I

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,730
tell them how excited I am so I'm going

00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,070
to tell all of you now how excited I am

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,780
about angular 2 I'm super excited about

00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,370
this whole shadow that I'm failing it's

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,959
hard for me to explain but like it's

00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,090
gonna be cool trust me on this one I

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:20,250
cannot express to you just how excited I

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,250
am about zones it is the bee's knees

00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:32,560
what it is the bee's knees

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:36,130
okay michigo if you say it is the bee's

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,050
knees but as long as you're excited

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:43,530
we are excited so are you guys excited

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:46,420
about angular 2 good because it's time

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:49,500
for sure time they told me not to leave

00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:52,500
the table so here you go

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,500
and

00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:04,370
yeah

00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:06,710
okay so as our first emotion we got the

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,830
level up okay this was the start of the

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:14,540
journey but soon came the second emotion

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:20,210
which was panic and see if you can guess

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:22,130
why so what's new in angular2 so there's

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,750
no template there's no filters we've

00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,860
killed the controller oh my god

00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,600
everything has changed for the

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,730
difference is gonna be so big we killed

00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,700
angular module as well the config phase

00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:33,920
is done dollars go across the way

00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,140
transclusion is not there all the event

00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,850
system are gone no more ng clicks no

00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,210
morning tomorrow all those directors I

00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,210
just named

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:56,300
well that escalated quickly

00:05:52,370 --> 00:06:03,560
I like a disguise is like a Jedi or what

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:08,120
you know is gone so should we start yeah

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,669
so soon after we had some questions

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,960
about this panic between should we start

00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:13,850
with angular 1 and then think about

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,290
migrating to angular 2 because we're

00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,610
kind of lost what person do you think

00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,850
would be best to start with right now

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,350
I'm needs angular should I learn ng 1 or

00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,770
what if I want to go into production

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:29,380
soon I really 10 years old and I walked

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,380
about anger to be easier than angular 1

00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:42,870
so to build to the younger crowd there

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:47,370
the core team started answering question

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:49,229
using rap music the filter filter is

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,759
filtered but the tilt of the pipe is

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:54,229
actually a formatter so it's really a

00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,229
formatter filter you follow up

00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:07,580
yeah but that didn't help so much to the

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:11,150
panic level so then the courting sort of

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:14,240
about a brilliant idea to recruit one of

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,250
the nicest people in the whole world I'm

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,620
talking about Martin Probst

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,720
okay just look at how we tells you

00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,390
everything you know about angular is

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,610
gone we have to be honest it is actually

00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,850
a rewrite we really rewrote angular 1

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,740
from the ground up into angular 2

00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:33,230
everything changes and you know

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,710
oh no right this is happening oh no

00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,710
panic

00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:43,879
oh no panic he's so nice you can tell me

00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,360
my house is on fire and still be cool

00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:48,199
with it

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,369
oh no we fall in the skies with no

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:55,069
parachute

00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:58,279
oh no ballet so that helped a bit lower

00:07:55,069 --> 00:08:03,379
in panic level which leads us to this

00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:09,019
third inevitable emotion impatience okay

00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:12,729
so yeah the more we heard how angular 2

00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:15,769
is not ready yet the more we want to ask

00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:18,289
finally like when can we get our hands

00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:20,419
on to the final version of two legs a

00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,279
lot of people ask me hey get spread when

00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:23,479
will angle err to be done you know that

00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,729
I love answering this question

00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:29,619
could you provide and expect a schedule

00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:29,619
for super release RC

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,760
wheat-bread always used to answer with

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,349
again you know I've been really poor at

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,640
predicting the future I'm not good at

00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,169
predicting the future I think like we

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,580
try to predict the future and I hate

00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:45,560
predicting the future yeah our crystal

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,920
ball about predicting the future it's

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,920
not good

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,740
first brett-brett come on I wanna try

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:04,330
this one

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:09,730
it's 2.0 you got zones in it and as you

00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:17,770
know it is the bee's knees okay yeah so

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:20,470
okay so disappointed by the not being

00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:22,440
able to predict the future they turn to

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,760
the one man who might just help them

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,150
figure out when is

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,380
angular2 going to be released your team

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,900
and so I'd actually like to invite

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:39,400
Murray Goldstein to the stage to talk

00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:41,410
about some of the work he's done yes my

00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,250
personal friend or eagle sting the

00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:47,790
angular meteor guy also known as ng

00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,790
Jesus

00:09:51,389 --> 00:10:00,610
yeah it's a real picture okay so so even

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:04,600
he couldn't predict the future or when's

00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:06,490
the release date so we were left with

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,569
only one choice to try and figure out

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:12,939
when it will get released ourselves try

00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:17,230
to assess the number of features and by

00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:21,990
that the year of the release so let's go

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:24,279
back to 2 2 2014 2 ng Europe and Europe

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:29,290
when the first announced the development

00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:30,490
of angular 2 what are the ingredients in

00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,639
angular 2 we're going to talk about

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:41,649
mobile we'll talk about performance and

00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:47,740
scale ok let's see so we have we're

00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:50,439
talking about mobile ok so ok and we're

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:54,160
talking about performance and it should

00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:56,529
be like scale okay so we're talking

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,459
about like I don't know one year of the

00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:05,040
development and it should be done by

00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:07,720
2015 probably right but then came 2015

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,569
there's a couple things that we think we

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,139
can do to actually push our abilities

00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,139
even further

00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:26,310
let's talk about server-side wait what

00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,310
so we have done a lot of things in

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:31,140
angular 2 to make it possible to run

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,269
things on a server this is a much more

00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,950
generic framework it is very high

00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:36,810
priority for us to have lazy loading

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,760
today no naturalisation there's still a

00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,640
lot of stuff we need to do with regards

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,470
to payload size since ng comp we

00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,079
actually didn't know that we were going

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:51,170
to do this kind of exciting when fun

00:11:46,079 --> 00:12:00,240
things like that happen yeah exciting

00:11:51,170 --> 00:12:02,640
or should I say panic yeah so guys just

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,980
released the framework already okay

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,320
enough with the with the feature look at

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,560
all this feature okay I talking about

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,740
like like I don't know like another year

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,329
of development and and we just want just

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,000
release the framework and leave it with

00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:20,880
these features okay and then add more

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,329
afterwards so we'll be done by 2016 and

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,860
that's it okay okay okay

00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:29,019
is that we're building a command-line

me tell you why let me tell you why

00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,629
we've actually been working

00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:28,380
yeah but from the outside we were like

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:31,610
sure yeah nobody it's cool it's cool but

00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,610
from the inside we're alike

00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:14,890
yeah this is how we felt so I want to

00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:17,860
review this emotional journey and so we

00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:21,579
had three emotions we had excitement we

00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:23,939
had panic and we had impatience and I'd

00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:28,350
like to address the angular team now and

00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:28,350
just look at these strong emotions

00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,210
basically what they mean I know we can

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,520
be annoying sometimes and ask these

00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,530
pesky questions about when you can get

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,300
them released and stuff like that and I

00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:44,190
know I can be annoying sometime with

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:48,820
these talks but think of it like this

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:53,470
these emotions mean that we actually

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:57,340
care okay so actually care about what

00:17:53,470 --> 00:18:03,460
you're doing and basically we believe in

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:07,210
you and well I I believe in you and all

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:11,050
this ng-conf attendees believes in you

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:13,740
and all the people watching all over the

00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:17,140
world now over I think thirty thousand

00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,660
believes in you I believe in you and so

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,420
I don't know if you get the chance to

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:24,820
actually feel it and think about it

00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:29,110
while you're busy working accountants of

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:33,190
ours so I am sure that soon you will

00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:36,610
start getting love tweets I don't know

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:39,490
how okay but we start getting some love

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:43,510
and some support over your hard hard

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:46,929
work making angular2 a reality so let's

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:51,400
make 2016 the year of angular 2 finally

00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:54,400
and yeah and that's not stand on the

00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:58,000
sidelines and like I said last year we

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,980
can do a pull request but I know 99% of

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,580
the people don't have the time to to

00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:06,460
create one so we we can just vote plus

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:09,180
one or minus one on things like pipe

00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:12,870
pipe and

00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:16,410
and just participate and help make it a

00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:18,540
reality so I like to thank my friends
