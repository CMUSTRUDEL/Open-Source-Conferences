so it's just the people that were too

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,920
lazy to get up and go to food yeah all

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,760
right well welcome everybody to

00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:19,560
JavaScript jammer we are live at ng comp

00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,820
this week on our panel will just go down

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,160
the line and have everyone introduce

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,670
themselves real quick and then we'll get

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,349
started go ahead Joe I'm Joe one of the

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:34,469
organizers of ng-conf I'm Dave Smith I'm

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,020
Charles max would I'm Michael kofsky one

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,579
of the founders of briefing DB I'm

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,660
jameson matter breath because I just

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:46,739
crowd surfed up to the stage sorry Amy

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:49,230
night all right so we are talking this

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,030
week about horizon correct that's right

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,920
yeah horizon you want to give us quick

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,920
rundown for people who don't know what

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,390
it is absolutely so it's important to

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,160
first day this is a new project from the

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,590
reefing DB team I think you guys had my

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,809
co-founder Slava on JS jabber a couple

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,339
episodes back and just for those folks

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,560
who don't know everything to be is it's

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,240
a open source database that's really

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,830
great for building real-time apps it

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,960
allows you to subscribe to streams on

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,210
queries and it makes it much easier to

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,740
build things like Google Docs or slack

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,790
anything we're like lots of clients are

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,979
connected and talking to each other in

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,659
real time and so we have a lot of users

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,220
or building with rethink today and

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,930
they're building like amazing

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,970
applications and they come to us a lots

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,290
of questions and problems and a lot of

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,970
them are trying to figure out how to do

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,189
it how to build a real-time map or

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,299
JavaScript app you know even simpler

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,770
than it is today because right now if

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,299
you want to get started you want to

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,860
build like a JavaScript app there's a

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,689
lot of work just to get up and running

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,130
with like angular or react or anything

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,479
else you want to play with you got to go

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,770
through like a whole ton of steps you

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,909
got to figure out how to build your

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,070
back-end you got to figure out how to

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,079
how to write code to be able to get data

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,600
from your database or from someplace you

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,670
know into your browser and so basically

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,320
horizon is this new project and it's

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,759
built on top of rethink it used as a

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,680
rethink tb's to properties which is

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,630
linear scale because you can scale out

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,579
linearly nodes you can grow clusters and

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,860
you can push real-time updates from

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,280
briefing TB and what it is is a complete

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,050
open real-time back end Open Source that

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,450
runs on your laptop or you can deploy to

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,150
the cloud and it comes with a database a

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,799
back-end

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,299
all the things you need you can connect

00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:18,099
to it from your browser it's a

00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:20,019
standalone server and start writing your

00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,659
reactor angular app with no backend code

00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:24,340
and get from 0 to 60 and then when

00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:26,500
you're ready to start writing back end

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,239
code it's a series of node.js modules

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,670
you can then hook into like your Express

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,680
or coma or hoppy stack and what it does

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,000
is it tries to take every problem that

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,129
people try to solve when building

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,590
real-time apps or JavaScript apps things

00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:40,900
like how do I get data out how do I like

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:44,109
authenticate users identity access

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,670
control session management all the

00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:47,200
issues that people kind of just keep

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,150
writing over and over all the boil plate

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,680
code and it tries to abstract it away

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,810
into convenient modules that you're able

00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,400
to use in your app and so you can get

00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,319
started with this back end with no

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,430
back-end code whatsoever just write it

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,389
from straight from the browser and when

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,129
you're ready to extend it it's

00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:04,840
extensible it's open source it works

00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:07,420
with a note Jess ecosystem so you said a

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,060
lot of words and yeah it might have it

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,040
does mean open source firebase is that a

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,810
fair comparison it's a fair comparison

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,189
so it feels a lot like open sores

00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,900
firebase like it like runs on your

00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:18,910
laptop it gives you a back-end that you

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,560
can connect you from your browser but

00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,840
it's more than just firebase because

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,120
firebase and other services like them

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,859
back ends as a service as developers

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,180
when you have an API that limits what

00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:29,590
you can do like it limits what you can

00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,540
build your app and so at some point

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,220
people grow past the bounds we can do

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,349
with the back end as a service and so

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,150
because horizon is both a complete

00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,889
back-end server so it runs like firebase

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,569
you can connect to it but also it's a

00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:42,129
bunch of node.js modules you can then

00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:44,049
extend it you can write custom back-end

00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:45,549
code and you can take it beyond what you

00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:47,139
could do with the with just a back-end

00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:49,239
as a service so you can still access the

00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:50,889
database you can still use any no module

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,889
want to work with okay that makes sense

00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:56,109
so the idea is at some point firebase

00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:57,280
might not I mean you want to do

00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:59,079
something weird that firebase doesn't

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,729
support but I can just like plug that in

00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,620
to the server that you control because

00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:04,629
it's you're running it its horizon it

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,060
snowed that's exactly right okay that

00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:08,769
makes sense now is that extended through

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,229
something like because you're saying no

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,690
Jas plugins so are we talking something

00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:16,329
like Express or some other framework or

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,829
is it more along the lines of oh here's

00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:21,010
a really convenient way to write

00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,779
functions that do stop in horizon no

00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,789
it's just Express it's as plain straight

00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:26,370
javascript and mpm modules there's no

00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:30,070
magic about it oh

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:31,600
I'm also wondering a little bit is there

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,800
some kind of because because whenever I

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,500
think about these systems I mean I

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,080
remember couchdb kind of did this with

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,310
an HTTP interface you know and then we

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,180
have firebase and everybody solves these

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,470
security issues at least and

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,870
authentication issues in different ways

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,060
and some of them work really great and

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,950
some of them really don't I'm a little

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,360
curious what what is the security model

00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,639
around something like this to keep

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,320
people from taking advantage of the fact

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,390
that you essentially have a database out

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,040
there that anybody can touch from

00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,540
anywhere in the world yeah that's a

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,520
really good question so when people

00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,110
started using rethink we had these

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,310
people like come on github and it would

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,050
to open these issues and it asks the

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,640
question like I'm opening this stream

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,080
from the database and I'm doing it from

00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,880
the browser and the first time that

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,530
people did that we were like don't do

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,700
that like that's don't use the database

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,410
behind it back end right you want to

00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,690
make sure that you secure access to the

00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,680
database after the 50th the person asked

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,910
us we're like well there's something

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,250
here we've got to figure out like why

00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,690
why people are asking us this and that's

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,520
where horizon sort of stemmed from and

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,389
so you know you can think of horizon is

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,070
you know it gives you a bunch of

00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:31,540
convenient tools but the security model

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,280
is incredibly important because that's

00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,890
how you control access to the data from

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,950
the back end and so basically it's

00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:40,900
designed so that you can you can both

00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,430
declare security rules like similar to

00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,510
something like firebase but it's much

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,039
more sophisticated where you can

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,750
actually do programmatic control and

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,979
we've been building it with the feedback

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,750
from like we have a private developer

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,070
preview right now and there's over a

00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,810
thousand developers and we building of

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,669
building it with us in private it's at

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,260
horizon die oh and we've been gone

00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:57,490
through a ton of work iterations unlike

00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,650
what would be a really good security

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,060
model and the answer is that you need to

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,430
make it really simple to we'll just

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,350
declare this this role needs access this

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,610
this kind of data and then be able to

00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,200
extend it so that it works with your

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,000
functions they can actually use it when

00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,229
writing programmatic code because at

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,610
some point you're going to go past the

00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:14,830
bounds of what security rules can do

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,720
right but what what does the admin

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,910
interface look like because I definitely

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,070
going back to couch TV in particular I

00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,419
mean I had nightmares because your admin

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,210
interface was through the same web

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:27,039
interface that you were accessing

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,530
everything else and so I was always

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,110
worried okay how do how do you control

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,970
this because somebody has an attack

00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,979
vector right there yeah in the web

00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,230
interface to get at this so is there

00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:39,480
some kind of back

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,960
config that you give us or a list of

00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:45,240
users or here's the database or how does

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,860
that all go so basically you do NPM

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,810
install horizon then you start up a

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,790
project you get a couple folders the

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,560
folders are one folder you drop your

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,300
static files in and it just runs the

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,740
server off of that then there's a set of

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,420
configuration files it can declare

00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,490
things like security rules that run on

00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,560
the back end there also is a web UI

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,850
which allows you to do things like see

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,220
the number of connected clients or

00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,990
interact with with the horizon back end

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,720
but it's designed so that it's secured

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,830
from day one we don't build features by

00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,180
everything to be team we never build

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,770
features that are insecure we always try

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,330
to make sure that we build it in a way

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,310
where you know you can expose it to the

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,990
world and not have to worry about right

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,390
so you set it up so that I can configure

00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,620
it and say i'm the admin and then i can

00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:25,830
actually go into this admin interface

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,510
and i can add users or add roles and see

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,910
all the other stuff but that that

00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:38,190
initial access is something that is

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:40,470
controlled offline yes ok so my rethink

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,240
the existing rethink to be be skills

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,190
which are impressive by the way thank

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,630
you thank you am I going to be able to

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:48,600
leverage those when working with horizon

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,010
yes so the beauty of horizon is that our

00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,970
vision is that you know people are

00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,620
running everything to be clusters

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,850
already a lot of people don't want to

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,650
think about running a database this is

00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,330
what we discovered like we started

00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,440
building databases and then a lot of

00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,790
people don't want to think about what

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,710
database they pick right there are

00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,970
reasons to pick a different database for

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,650
example in rethink DB if you want

00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,290
real-time updates it's a good reason to

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,370
use rethink right if you want um schema

00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,870
free database right that's another

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,370
reason to look at something like manga

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,380
or we think because your development

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,430
practices need to change but for a lot

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,950
of people they don't want to think about

00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,600
it and so for horizon it just kind of

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,790
gives them a whole stack but for

00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,950
existing rethink DB users what horizon

00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,050
allows you to do is use it on existing

00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,400
cluster drop it on top and now you're

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,840
able to let your JavaScript developers

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,340
just start building real-time apps like

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,950
very quickly on top of your existing

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,690
real-time data set so an example this is

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,310
like there's a team at NASA that uses

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,900
everything to be and this is like one of

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,550
the coolest use cases that I've heard of

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,580
so far where they're actually using it

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,500
to track the sensors that are used on

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,970
spacesuits on the space station the

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,070
National Space Station like oxygen

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,630
sensors and then they use rethink DB to

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,380
process the data in real time for their

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,810
new infrastructure

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,970
and so for them like that team they can

00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:56,340
drop horizon on top and now any NASA

00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,480
developer who like Noah's JavaScript can

00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,220
start building dashboards and start

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,300
building like apps on top of it and this

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,000
is really amazing because it

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,770
democratizes access to real-time data

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,390
sets and it makes it so that if you're a

00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,680
small agency and just want to build

00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,660
something quickly you can get started

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,760
but if you're a large team with like

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,470
lots of bits lots of datasets lots of

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,480
tools deployed you can use something

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,580
like horizon to allow more developers to

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,170
build apps more quickly so I'm still

00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,810
struggling to really understand exactly

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,910
how i would put horizon into production

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,950
but what you're describing sounds a

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,020
little bit like meteor where it kind of

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,400
puts the server between the database and

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,290
the client so you have to think less

00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,760
about that server piece is that a good

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,430
comparison that's an apt comparison

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,810
there's a philosophical difference in

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,210
how meteor approaches building

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,830
JavaScript apps if you step back for

00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,540
just a moment and you look at how people

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,860
killed JavaScript apps today there are

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,200
really three patterns and people follow

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,150
one is they go when they assemble stacks

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,920
off of github the mean stack the three

00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,000
stack you know you pick javascript

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,710
components and try to figure out how to

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,240
glue it together usually using something

00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,710
like webpack write something like that

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,180
the issue with that of course is that

00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,890
it's hard to get started it's hard to

00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,870
like add new tools it's hard to figure

00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,190
out how to start building your app when

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,650
you move past the balance of what that

00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,360
basic stack gives you the second pattern

00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,040
is like firebase right or some sort of

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,230
back in as a service which dramatically

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,280
removes like all this like all the

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,080
components for you so you don't have to

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,520
think about it but ultimately will limit

00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,260
if you want to grow past the balance of

00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,020
what you want to build it's a meteor

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,400
they did a really great job two years

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,230
ago they set the bar for developer

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,330
experience where they try to organize

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,250
like an open-source stack for how you

00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,020
use javascript and the way they did this

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,030
was too tightly couple a bunch of

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,680
components things like MongoDB and a

00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,150
bunch of meteor components of the stack

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,310
and say we're going to give you a really

00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,810
polished experience it's going to be the

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,400
way we describe you're going to use it

00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,480
it's going to be prescriptive and it's a

00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,610
walled garden that you can basically

00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,080
build your apps inside of but it's going

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,060
to work really well in fluidly and for a

00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,680
lot of people that works well but it

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,510
doesn't really work within the the

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,130
bazaar of open source it doesn't really

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,780
work with the engine of open stores

00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,610
developing new tools and over time

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,260
there's been a lot of pressure for the

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,090
meteor stack to evolve and because it's

00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:00,700
been so tightly coupled it's hard for

00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:03,670
people to add new tools and so I

00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,900
in contrast horizon what it is is it's

00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,550
designed so that it will work with the

00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,130
open source ecosystem it still gives you

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,390
a consistent stack but it stopped at the

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,890
view layer it doesn't define anything

00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,270
that you do in the in the interview

00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,910
layers you could build like react or

00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:18,940
angular cycle view straight JavaScript

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:21,370
or whatever you want to use and what the

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,420
server exposes web sockets by default so

00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,340
you connect to the server via web

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,860
sockets we're going to add adapters for

00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,180
things like graft well or Falkor because

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,830
we make no opinions about how you get

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,810
data in or out and it's more of a

00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,610
purpose-built tool and a convenient set

00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:36,700
of tools that allow you to basically add

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,080
open source components easily and we've

00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,060
already seen people extended in really

00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,080
amazing ways so this community has been

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,790
building it with us for the past couple

00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,830
of months someone just released a really

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,990
lovely it's called lovely Jas in fact

00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,640
it's a really lovely library that makes

00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,680
it dramatically easier to work with

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,150
react and so we expect that people will

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,250
extend it in lots of really interesting

00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,720
ways and they'll add as a JavaScript

00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,710
community keeps innovating keeps

00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,410
building new things and we're going to

00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,850
add it to horizon does horizon well you

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,290
mentioned that it uses web sockets to

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,690
communicate with between server and

00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,310
browser does it also define what the

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,640
message format is for those or is that

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:12,550
up to the developer so the horizon API

00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,470
it's it's basically a simpler version of

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,610
the reefing DB query language the query

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,930
language everything to be is too

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,040
powerful it's a full programming

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,630
language you can't put that in the

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,330
browser it's you can't do access control

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:25,720
on it so we basically designed an API by

00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,460
the same team and that format is defined

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,280
by us coming out of the horizon server

00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,080
but it's very easy to add adapters like

00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,670
I said for things like graph ql where

00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,870
there's no format that would map to

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,400
something that the WebSockets would use

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,420
right they have their own approach

00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,730
towards solving these kinds of problems

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,870
and we fully expect that like people we

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,920
want people to like create different

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,140
ways of getting data in and out of the

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,610
back end so we don't define anything but

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:50,350
we do give like a first-class experience

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:53,020
if you're using the horizon API so i

00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,070
have a question so when i was doing the

00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,360
boot camp for like when I got started

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,370
with programming like one of the very

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,740
first things that we ever did was like

00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,870
hook up firebase to our front end so do

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,270
you think that horizon is going to be as

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,520
easy to get started as it would be with

00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,630
i was using firebase yeah i think it's

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,310
going to be incredibly easy to get

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,170
started in fact that's one of the big

00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,670
adopters we've seen we've seen two

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,590
adopters in like the getting started

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,170
rapid prototype

00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:18,150
in camp agencies which just need to ship

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,410
new projects all the time they don't

00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,120
want to deal with the hassle of like

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:24,330
building building stacks all the time

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,920
and people who are like in schools like

00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,210
Deb schools they're like this is exactly

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,010
what we want because we can offer our

00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,840
developers a consistent set of tools and

00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,880
practices and tell them like we've made

00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,200
a horizon stack maybe we added one or

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,670
two components that will help you when

00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,890
you're learning but it should help

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,750
people adopt new technologies like react

00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,340
or angular and not have to think about

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,110
every single component across the stack

00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,470
not have to deal with webpack not have

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:48,690
to deal with all these intricacies

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,280
related to that I'm wondering as you get

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,260
new people involved I mean one of the

00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:55,500
nice things about firebase is the setup

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:57,990
is I go get an account right with

00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,400
horizon it sounds like I have to go and

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,100
actually get it I have to install

00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,470
rethink DB and install horizon is that

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,270
something that new people really can do

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:11,940
without having a lot of experience with

00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:13,200
things like command line or NPM or some

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,230
of the other package managers like

00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,880
homebrew on the Mac that's a very

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,860
reasonable question so we're going to

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,850
offer like a prebuilt package a typical

00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,160
just download because we already

00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,800
distribute rethink DB on homebrew as a

00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,630
DM GS you can just install it but more

00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,620
importantly we're gonna have like coming

00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,600
out in the next couple months we're

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,580
gonna have a cloud service called

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,750
horizon cloud which will you can run it

00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,250
wherever you want you know you can

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,870
deploy using Cooper Nettie's which is an

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,890
amazing piece of technology you know

00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,570
we're dock or whatever you feel like

00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,190
doing but we're going to offer like a

00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,840
very simple way to just get your eyes an

00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,820
app up and running so you just type

00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,750
horizon deploy and you have this like

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,640
tool that's been installed in your

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,440
machine and so you know if your novice

00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,820
developer you probably should start to

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,100
learn the command line but you don't

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,720
need to have brew and NPM necessarily on

00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,550
day one so we're going to allow people

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,980
to just get started with a basic stack

00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,600
but most developers these days you know

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,950
even if they're like novices you know

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,720
have these tools and we want to make it

00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,190
sort of easy to get on boarded no matter

00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,690
how you get started and with the cloud

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,370
service will be pretty easy to basically

00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,250
allow people to get the app instantly

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,930
within 10 seconds like on the cloud yeah

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:16,050
the other question that I have as far as

00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,450
people using it is that I've been

00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,690
involved with people who run boot camps

00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,850
not only in JavaScript for web

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,170
development but I mean JavaScript's kind

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,209
of become ok now I'm going to build a

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,369
desktop app with

00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:30,619
Tron or I'm going to build a Windows app

00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:32,509
with wind jas I'm going to build an Xbox

00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:35,119
app with with jas which apparently you

00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:37,490
can do or I'm going to build a mobile

00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:40,579
app with native script and so there are

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:44,059
all of these different areas that you're

00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:46,009
working in where yeah its data access

00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:48,619
but it's not the same from one platform

00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:51,529
to the next and your concerns change so

00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:53,749
is horizon something that any of these

00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:56,480
people should be able to go boom I set

00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:59,749
it up and now I'm going to start using

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,579
it for my application yeah so javascript

00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:03,170
is amazing because the community has

00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:05,749
taken it to places that I would not have

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,790
expected five years ago and it's amazing

00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:09,679
because if you look in the front end you

00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,240
know we now have sophisticated tools for

00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,949
software architecture things like angler

00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,139
and react think about the world using

00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:16,429
components in additional data flow right

00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:18,170
these are like really solid principles

00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:20,720
of software engineering right on the

00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,550
back end node is like a sink massively

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,199
paralyzed really great for these kinds

00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,179
of apps and so basically we're seeing it

00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:28,670
pop up as you mentioned like mobile you

00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:30,529
know in electron apps and horizon will

00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,699
be useful in all those contexts so we

00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:34,009
already have people who have shift apps

00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,869
of the App Store on horizon and like we

00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:37,759
expect that like if you're building the

00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,019
idea behind being able to build an app

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,999
and share eighty percent in ninety

00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:42,589
percent of your code base with the

00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:44,420
desktop version and the mobile version

00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:46,040
and the web version that's like a really

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,869
beautiful vision of like how to build

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,059
software because you have common code

00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:51,980
bases and the data stack should be

00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:53,839
common across them as well and so we're

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,610
adding features hopefully that will make

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,350
it easier for use in a mobile context

00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,819
expected to be able to do things like

00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,129
push notifications and other services

00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:03,350
that services like parse offered you

00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:04,789
know before they before they ended and

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,169
and so we want to be able to let those

00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:08,120
developers say okay what's the next

00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:10,130
thing and I want to be able to use all

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,480
this cool technology today I'm just

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,189
going to use this comment stack and

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,449
build it for desktop for mobile for web

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:16,250
and I expect we're going to see

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:19,880
JavaScript to go into even more exciting

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:21,319
places I find myself listening to your

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,579
questions differently today check

00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:25,939
there's like something about you that

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,319
just makes me want to check is wearing a

00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:30,770
Jedi robe for all the people that can't

00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:33,980
see so these are not the libraries you

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,990
are looking at that's perfect I have a

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,690
vague question that I hope becomes less

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,530
vague as I ask it in my experience I've

00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,720
built some app

00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:45,200
that have a real time component but the

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,000
whole app is not real time and I can't

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,160
tell that's because I'm like an old man

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,170
who isn't cooling with it and and

00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,730
everything should be real time or yeah

00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:59,780
that's it yeah you can stop now okay

00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:02,300
done or or is that a common pattern that

00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,010
you expect to see or do you expect by

00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,630
making the tooling better for building

00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,830
real time apps that apps will migrate

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,080
more towards real time does that make

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,400
sense makes perfect sense so that well

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,780
first of all I do think as tooling

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,640
improves people just going to start to

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,980
use these features more readily but look

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,650
at angular 2 right so observables are a

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,940
amazing bit of technology because they

00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,470
allow you to think about unbounded data

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,330
streams and and really deal with them

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,190
and with an amazing set of tools we're a

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,660
huge fan of like things like observables

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,220
and anything with reactive data

00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,320
obviously because we think is all about

00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,730
that and angular 2 has like observables

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,740
throughout and now people are talking

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,700
about them and now they're a staple

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,320
similarly promises this took a little

00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,060
while for things to hit but once the

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,650
community sort of understood why it's

00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,540
valuable everyone just started using

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,520
them for everything and so between

00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,410
things like observables and promises as

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,900
the fundamental underpinnings of like

00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,760
tools to work with horizon is all about

00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,010
observables so it just uses RX j is 5

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,020
and you can you have you know the

00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:56,030
ability to use all the observable

00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,860
functions as well as like higher level

00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,960
things from horizon and so i think that

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,600
like as these tools get democratized

00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,100
people just naturally adopt them it's

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,300
the bazaar of open source like people go

00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,550
and grab tools you would never expect

00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,380
using the ways you wouldn't expect and

00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,640
then now they become like lingua franca

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,190
for the web like now everyone's using

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,280
javascript what if I don't expect to

00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,720
have too much of a real-time need in my

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,150
app do you think horizon is still

00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,890
valuable can you tell us about that use

00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,690
case there are two modes for getting

00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:27,080
data out of the back end at least in the

00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,790
default API there's fetch and watch and

00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,070
so watch we'll just open an unbounded

00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:33,020
stream you write some query and because

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,340
rethink DB is running under the hood you

00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,110
could do really sophisticated things

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,940
because the query language allows you to

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,140
do things like joins or you know

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,520
distributed operations you would

00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,650
normally find in like a sequel database

00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,600
right so all those features sort of

00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,820
filter up to the horizon front end and

00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,950
and you can you can just get data out

00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,330
with fetch and you can open a stream

00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,320
will just keep pushing you updates with

00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,820
watch so to move from one car

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,320
text the other is like really easy and

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,789
it kind of keeps developers from

00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,110
thinking about this they just think how

00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:00,659
do I expect to use this so we need live

00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,220
updates or not they turn it on or off so

00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:04,110
you mentioned security which obviously

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,700
is one of the main motivations for a

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,759
layer like horizon between your database

00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,549
and the client when a client tries to

00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:13,259
run a watch or a fetch how does horizon

00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:15,000
decide whether they have access to do

00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:17,370
that yes so as I mentioned there's

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,600
basically shin to establish you know

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,309
security rules where you can basically

00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,799
define roles and you can do more

00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:24,480
sophisticated templating and so you just

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,769
define I had this type of user and they

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,990
should have access to this type of data

00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:29,549
and when the client connects they say I

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,779
am this type of user and they're

00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:31,679
authentic ated against the backend

00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:33,269
server what if I have like a

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,220
multi-tenant environment where it's like

00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:38,309
not just this type of data but like

00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,049
these records in this table our mind and

00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:41,429
those other records are some other users

00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:43,500
like how does that work yes so basically

00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:44,940
people own documents and it's a you're

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,860
able to share permissions between each

00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:53,730
other so I have one more security

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:55,409
question as a business person i love the

00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,820
ready-made solutions right i don't have

00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:58,259
to develop them I don't have to pay

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,870
anybody to develop them and I'm spending

00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:03,750
time on them I just set them up and they

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:05,429
work but as a DevOps person in a

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,860
programmer I hate the ready-made

00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:09,929
solutions because I have to freaking

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,120
update them right so anything that I

00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:13,889
have running wordpress if a new version

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,049
comes out and I don't update it that day

00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:18,659
I'm gonna get hacked I mean it's not

00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:22,139
quite that bad but some days is that bad

00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:26,100
I'll hack you that's cool so the issue

00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:28,350
is you know you want some sort of

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,090
automatic update or you you know you

00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:33,029
have to keep tabs on what's going on

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:35,250
with horizon so what is kind of the

00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:36,870
update cycle on that I mean are you

00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,899
going to release on a regular basis if

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:42,299
there's a hotfix that I need are you how

00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,950
am I going to know that so you know

00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,929
rethink TB has been a long time thinking

00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,460
about this because I mean security and

00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,779
database is kind of go hand in hand you

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,850
need to be extremely security conscious

00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:53,100
so we have a very aggressive release

00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:55,289
cycle we ship security patches very

00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,700
quickly if they're necessary and we have

00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:58,649
like a whole process we've gone through

00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,539
rethink TB is used in by some of the

00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:01,710
largest institutions in the world one of

00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,419
the biggest online brokerages in the

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,980
world with over 25 million users runs

00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,280
every day for the webbing belt and they

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,960
trust

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,920
security to it and so we've worked with

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,570
them because we have enterprise

00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,220
customers to figure out what you

00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,170
actually have to do to communicate it's

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,570
not just about the technology it's about

00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,610
the communication right and so horizon

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:19,620
is built by the same team we have a

00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,300
similar approach we're going to be able

00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,070
to post security advisories if needed

00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,110
and you just update through em cam if

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,240
necessary the other nice thing is that

00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,650
even though horizon everything to be

00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,660
seem like they're separate they could be

00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,160
shipped as like a complete stack so when

00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,380
you have a change rather than having to

00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,690
figure out do I have to update one of

00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,610
five or seven components there's one

00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,780
consistent environment and this is

00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,000
really great for larger teams as well

00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,230
because as you said devops teams are

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,940
like tearing their hair out try to

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,380
figure out what i'm going to update this

00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,760
whole products that will just scan like

00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,930
docker images to figure out what are the

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,390
security vulnerabilities and how to

00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:54,120
update this so consistency help solve

00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:56,460
this problem for large teams right but

00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,590
is there like a security mailing list I

00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,750
should be on or does it notify you

00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:04,140
somehow or I'll let you know after i

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:05,790
hack you it's cool there isn't a

00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,230
security melon list right now for

00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,060
horizon but because it's still in

00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,380
Developer Preview but as soon as it's

00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,870
like ready to launch we're going to ship

00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,480
all the things necessary for production

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:18,750
okay Chuck I think you have a rosy view

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:22,410
of what homeworld tools security is like

00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:24,330
if you're more worried about like the

00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,890
installed tools then I mean I'm going to

00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,810
write you an app and it will be hackable

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:31,110
from day one instead of when an exploit

00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:34,560
comes out so yeah a lot of times they

00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:37,320
are hackable from day one but if if it's

00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,790
a known exploit and it's a target that

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,410
is rich with information that people

00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:42,750
want okay so you're saying like

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,550
metasploit versus someone explicitly

00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,900
targeting you like channel just port

00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,790
scan the internet and be like oh they're

00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,560
running wordpress one yeah they're

00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:52,380
they're running they're running horizon

00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,580
and so I'm going to see ok I'm going to

00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,410
attack it this way and i'm going to try

00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,060
could try and get in that way and I'm

00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,890
gonna see if they have we password or

00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,170
this or that you know I mean there's

00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,760
only so much you can do but if there's

00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:05,550
an exploit out there for an older

00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,670
version of verizon then i want to know

00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:11,040
hey go update the things so that people

00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,600
can't exploit that against you so in

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,150
rethink DB we solve this problem by

00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,380
basically every 24 hours checking if

00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,080
there's an update available and then

00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,490
pinging you as soon as it's available so

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,659
your UI you see a thing drop down and

00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,190
saying you're out of date you got to

00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,179
update this when you start the server

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,289
it's going to tell you this server is

00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:25,460
out of date because you should be

00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:26,899
running an out of date database server

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,269
it's like such a critical part of your

00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:30,919
infrastructure and so you know horizons

00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:32,750
going to have very similar facilities we

00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,159
try to solve this problem for many years

00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,299
now so I'm pretty confident we're going

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,340
to come up with something that works

00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:39,350
it's also that security is built on

00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,630
trust right so like you use tools like

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,549
any tool you have that we like we

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,169
download tools from mpm all the time or

00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:46,789
different projects and we just trust

00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:48,769
that their security is good and that may

00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:50,659
not be very well placed right because

00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:51,620
you know somebody forgets to like you

00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:53,000
know to leave the password in an

00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,559
insecure place and suddenly everyone's

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,389
hacked right so there's a bit a bunch of

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,029
instances with cloud services where this

00:24:56,389 --> 00:25:00,260
has happened I would actually argue that

00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:01,970
having it be something you can sell host

00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,830
if you're that security conscious put it

00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,760
in a place that you care about watch all

00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,700
the network activity that's happening

00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,260
like open source sheds a light sunlight

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,059
is the best disinfectant especially for

00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,710
security so it's not just that you're

00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:14,029
like trusting us it's that you're

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,799
trusting that everybody in the community

00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:17,419
is also looking at and saying what's

00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:19,279
wrong with this code and you can't do

00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:21,769
that for most cloud services so being

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,240
open source I think actually is a huge

00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:25,250
advantage in that respect and then

00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,320
having it come from us we're a team that

00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,279
knows how to do this for a long time

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,570
hopefully keeps people some trust that

00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,970
they're going to be able to have faith

00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:37,130
in it Chuck if you ask another security

00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:42,289
question I'm going to fall asleep I was

00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:43,940
actually going to ask Joe yes we've

00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:47,269
talked a lot about kind of how it works

00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:49,330
and what it does we talked about you've

00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:52,490
managed not to scare me off that's gone

00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:54,590
so the next question I have is I'm kind

00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:56,269
of trying to catch the vision I think we

00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,649
kind of get the idea behind rethink to

00:25:56,269 --> 00:25:59,600
be you know we have the streams of data

00:25:57,649 --> 00:26:02,419
that we can push to we can pull

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,440
information out of we can we can make

00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:08,179
requests the API but what I mean what's

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,950
kind of the grand vision like what what

00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:13,789
am I specifically going to be thinking

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:14,750
oh I want to build an app like this you

00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:16,789
know and maybe you can give us some

00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:19,940
examples of apps that have been built on

00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:21,950
horizon to-do list that's right to do

00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,570
MVC with the Royals four months do list

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:26,120
always a paper

00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,730
but but I mean it's that kind of thing

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,930
right what kind of result you know if

00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,180
I'm thinking okay I'm going to build

00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:35,330
this kind of a poor I'm going to solve

00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:39,230
this kind of problem or I see this sort

00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:42,350
of thing going on in my app I should be

00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:45,350
thinking Oh verizon non verizon that's

00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,880
something else horizon is my solution is

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,840
the way that I want to go I think the

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,310
important thing you're Chuck is that

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,270
this is the JavaScript community and

00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:55,190
horizon is young so you should use it

00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:57,230
that's right better that was my other

00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,940
question saving it I just want to know

00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,320
how many different kinds of to-do apps I

00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,660
can build with it that's what I wanted

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,090
every flavor you could imagine all the

00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,600
to-do apps that they're right over the

00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:11,090
horizon Joe oh the puns are starting

00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,980
yeah it's a yes answer questions I mean

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,240
the easy answer is if you're building a

00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,100
jobs are good app right now and you

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,170
don't want to deal with like you know if

00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,910
education identity like access control

00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,080
permission session management anything

00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,700
that you need to do to build an app like

00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,020
this is going to be an easier way to get

00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,760
started it's gonna be any easier way to

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,170
continue to grow your app and it's going

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,730
to scale with you it's like millions of

00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,320
users because it rethink to be is

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,850
running under the hood and rethink tb's

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,860
been battle tested by a lot of people

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,690
and it can scale to like 30 plus nodes

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,130
easily teams have demonstrated running

00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,870
at a million ops per second and Amazon

00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,550
infrastructures without like breaking a

00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:42,680
sweat and it's really great for this

00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,300
kind of real-time apps the thing is that

00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,920
the reason why horizons interesting is

00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,030
because it allows you to use

00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,880
technologies you would not otherwise

00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:51,200
know how to get started with so a lot of

00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,160
people building with you know newer

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,300
frameworks things like cycle or um

00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,340
Shasta I think you guys are talking two

00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,410
shots two guys before oh yeah all these

00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,640
projects are like um people want to get

00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,410
started they don't know exactly how to

00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,020
get started with them so this makes that

00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,880
process easier but fundamentally because

00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:10,460
it's built on a real-time streaming

00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,080
architecture that is designed to scale

00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,270
to millions of users if you're building

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,760
anything with connected clients chat

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:18,860
mobile IOT lots of connected devices

00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,270
talking to each other anything where you

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,160
have large amounts of data that's

00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:23,780
constantly changing and you need to be

00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,790
able to figure out what's happening with

00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,440
it how to react in real time this

00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:29,240
normally if you're starting with rethink

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,340
there's all this code to build on top of

00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,230
it and horizon takes that experience and

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,940
raises it to the browser so it makes the

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,750
process of building these kinds of apps

00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,250
drum

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,690
matically easier and democratizes the

00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,490
ability for people to build these kinds

00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,350
of real-time streaming connected apps if

00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,360
you want to build slack if you want to

00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:46,100
build something today that's a very hard

00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,100
problem and with tools like this it just

00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,240
makes it dramatically easier so I'm

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,240
going to get to my other question now

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,090
Dave I'm a man my premiering technology

00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,610
right me too it makes my life easier

00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:00,410
because you know people have already

00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,000
proven it they've shaken out all the

00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:04,610
bugs they've worked out all of the ways

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,500
to use it you know I don't have to be

00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,000
that adventurous and I can pretty much

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,550
count on it doing what it says it's

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,740
going to do on the tin so this feels

00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:15,170
like something new I mean rethinks been

00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:19,460
around for a few years but you know

00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:21,080
horizon is a new-ish thing so is this

00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,720
something I just need to get over and

00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,880
try it or is this not for the faint of

00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,660
heart quite yet that's a good question

00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,520
um so horizon is brand new in fact it's

00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,600
been in Developer Preview and we started

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,310
building it like at the beginning of

00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,840
this year it's and if it turns out that

00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:38,870
javascript is a little bit easier to

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,520
write than databases right building

00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:42,080
everything to be and we ship the new

00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,030
release of rethink every six to eight

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,280
weeks so we have extremely fast like

00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,420
rapid iteration cycle we have a polish

00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,980
team that just knows how to build

00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,300
software incredibly well and I say that

00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,800
because they're way better than I am a

00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,480
tall building software like I would not

00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,090
touch building like the lower levels

00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,710
everything DB and at this point like the

00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,620
code base goes from assembly all the way

00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:02,360
to JavaScript right so horizon we built

00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,340
it very quickly we also had a lot of

00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,230
huge contributions in the community so

00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:09,380
it's moving extremely quickly if you're

00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,490
faint of heart wait a month maybe and by

00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,620
then we're going to be shipping it to

00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:13,760
the public and you'll be able to know

00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,380
that it's being used by some of the best

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,880
teams out there because there are like

00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,260
already banks and like large

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,030
institutions that are experimenting with

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,500
it and they're not really faint of heart

00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,990
about it because most of the heavy

00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,580
lifting is done by rethink DB horizon is

00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:27,920
like a thin JavaScript layer and that's

00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,020
pretty easy to test and figure out how

00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,480
what works and what doesn't if I wait a

00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:35,000
month will it be legacy if I wait a

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,950
month will it be legacy hahaha well it's

00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,139
just drive I've been burned before

00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,789
so article is basically like JavaScript

00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:43,409
world moves so quickly everyone has a

00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:44,970
framework fatigue it's really hard to

00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:46,320
figure out like what to look at next

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,330
because it's like almost like this like

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,240
sporadic change of technologies and

00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:52,649
horizon is like it's an attempt to try

00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,510
to slow that down and to give you

00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:55,710
something that you can rely on that you

00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,120
can then add your experimental

00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,919
technology on top if you want to play

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,690
with it I heard that you've already

00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:03,570
announced version 2 but it won't be out

00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:07,590
for two years the past two minutes uh

00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,789
proposed joke it's in the age of NPM

00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:11,570
right we're just shipping releases

00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:14,159
non-stop yeah so I have an OPS question

00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:17,279
one of the things my team has struggled

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,230
with is that we want redundancy in our

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,850
web app and we have back end we have

00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,649
front-end but it's kind of hard to

00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:24,929
manage deployment when you ever done an

00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:26,669
see because you ship new code here and

00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:28,110
then it makes a request and then that

00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:29,730
request ends up getting routed back to

00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,590
the load balancer to some server that

00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,870
doesn't have the new code yet and now

00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,429
it's like oh crap 404 or something like

00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:37,230
that does horizon help solve that

00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:38,730
problem yeah we plan to solve that

00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,350
problem because if you're shipping like

00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,480
new versions of your app constantly

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:44,100
versions to version 3 version for every

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,049
two minutes you know you want to be able

00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,639
to do rolling application upgrades you

00:31:46,049 --> 00:31:49,740
want to be able to phase out versions of

00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:51,179
your app over time and so basically you

00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,010
know we're building it's a little bit

00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:54,960
hard to do it in horizon itself because

00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:57,360
that's an ops question not a development

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,860
question but horizon cloud is a service

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,779
that will basically support all these

00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,669
things you can do it yourself by using

00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:04,110
open source tools like uber net is and

00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:05,789
building a lot of custom code but

00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,710
verizon cloud be a very easy way to ship

00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:09,779
new versions of your code new versions

00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,799
of your app do rolling backups like all

00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,940
the things you need to be able to make

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,460
sure that you don't have to deal with

00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:17,730
any ops headaches all right well we need

00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:20,370
to get to pics or you know we we have to

00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,720
get over before there's a speaker but

00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:27,320
anyway I'm really looking forward to

00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:29,429
angular Eisen and yeah let's go ahead

00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,230
Joe why don't you start us off the pics

00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:32,669
well since we're here at a conference I

00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:34,440
want to be a little conference oriented

00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:36,510
in my pics so I'm going to miss out this

00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,070
year on that conference which is

00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:39,600
actually loan of the conference that's

00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:41,100
like a tradition for you is it totally

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,360
is the first year i've missed it for

00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:44,370
like three years so I'm really just

00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,160
disappointed to be missing it so I'm

00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,840
gonna pick that conference

00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,340
i'm also going to pick angular connect

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,710
which is coming up this fall with more

00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,870
angular goodness in London awesome place

00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:56,470
to go and visit just do I don't want to

00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:59,180
live there it's too rainy too rainy and

00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:01,610
finally I want to pick react rally which

00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:04,070
is an awesome react conference done by

00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:06,050
Jameis haven't scoots our very own James

00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,900
I've been duped I stole some thunder

00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:10,640
here I've been to react conference right

00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,190
react comp and I've been to react rally

00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,160
and I won't publicly state which one I

00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:19,040
enjoyed more I'm in a hint very subtly

00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:22,040
that reactor Ali is awesome coming up in

00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,960

00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,270
and tickets i will tell you more when

00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:29,600
it's my turn to pick all right thank you

00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:31,850
there we go those are my pics quit David

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,890
all right I have one pic for you today

00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:38,930
and it is a almost brand new podcast

00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:42,190
hosted by none other than Jameson dance

00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:45,260
and some other guy oh it's me it's dave

00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:47,570
and the name of the podcast is soft

00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,370
skills engineering and it's to our

00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,230
knowledge the only podcast it's about

00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:56,650
development but not about technical

00:33:51,230 --> 00:34:00,530
stuff it's about like social skills

00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:03,200
titles organization stuff right Jameson

00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:05,920
yeah yeah I think we talked about what

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,480
do we talked about last time titles and

00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,820
pressure and a development team how to

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,320
onboard new engineers yes all that kind

00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,480
of stuff organizational processes it

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,310
anyways there's like so much stuff in

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,630
this space and people have been telling

00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,710

00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:26,220
send out for the Developer Preview my

00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:27,539

jabber pics because i find like cool

00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:34,529
like bit sick culture in some of it and

00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,180
so I wanted to share one of my favorite

00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:37,829
books that I always kind of like I give

00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,480
to a lot of people and it's called the

00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:41,640
art spirit it was written by an art

00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,230
professor an artist himself named Robert

00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,730
Audrey from like eighteen eighty to

00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,740
nineteen twenty want to say he lived in

00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:48,960
that time period now that's legacy yeah

00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,240
and he's a he's a gave a set of lectures

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,490
and essays on what it means to create

00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,680
art and software is a vehicle for ideas

00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,089
and art is a vehicle for ideas like art

00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,710
is very important to us everything to be

00:35:57,089 --> 00:36:01,109
because it allows us to represent ideas

00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,599
and share what it means to be building

00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:05,099
software and so this book it's a kind of

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,690
book you read it and you wake up at 3am

00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,950
of the words are in your head so I would

00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,289
urge anybody if you care about your

00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,490
craft if you want to find some if you're

00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:12,779
if you're feeling a little bit low and

00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,789
you need to find some way to be inspired

00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:16,490
go read the art spirit it's gonna it's

00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:20,339
going to be a really special experience

00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:21,690

00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,349
one is the the second half of what Joe

00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:35,940
said my ng-conf is awesome and I'm

00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:38,730
really glad to be here and I'm in no way

00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,960
trying to say like one better but but I

00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,509
do run a tech conference it's called

00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,920
reactor rally about react in August in

00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:46,740
salt lake city and tickets are on sale

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,420

00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,400
good time we'd love to see you there my

00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:53,460
other pic is it's an article that came

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,720
out a week or two ago called uncanny

00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:59,190
valley

00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,960
um it's a basically an essay by a woman

00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,750
who worked at a tech company in Silicon

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,390
Valley and and maybe more than any other

00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,640
article I've read it captures like the

00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,770
coolness and the weirdness of being in

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,119
that culture where it's all about you

00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,430
you can't just do your job right you

00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:17,010
have to like water slide into the office

00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:20,099
and I'm like segue your way up to your

00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:21,720
to your desk and I don't know there's

00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:23,130
just some really weird stuff that you

00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,400
don't really notice and so you back off

00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:30,780
so I love that article and then my last

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:33,060
pic is I think I'm just gonna pick kissy

00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,099
bashe it's an artist who makes awesome

00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,510
music yes Keisha Bosch is amazing oh

00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:40,290
nice now you know it's good because

00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:41,790
Michael agrees those are my pics okay I

00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,830
have to look here I have like a running

00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:46,020
list of things that I write down as I

00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:47,550
find them and this is one I think I'll

00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,140
be fitting for today because I am

00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:51,480
sitting in a room full of angular

00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,400
developers writing react right now but

00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,630
it is a blog post and you're gonna have

00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,480
to check the show notes for this because

00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:59,400
it's a really long URL here but it's

00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:04,190
just about criticizing programming

00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,190
languages so I think it is worth three I

00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:08,520
think I just had somebody recommend that

00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:11,520
one to me the other day so oh really

00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,460
okay yeah so anyway interesting but yes

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,190
it it's very very interesting so yeah

00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:18,270
yep I'll back you up on that one alright

00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,790
