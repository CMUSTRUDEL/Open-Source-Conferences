thank you thank you okay no I I'm going

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,000
to be nice to store wars this time so

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,299
this is a five-minute commercial for the

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,980
documentation and we're going to rock

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:22,500
around the docks with me your chief

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,189
editor and bottle washer and these are

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,800
your angular IO documents click that get

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:32,130
start in five minutes if you don't read

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,450
anything and you're going you may want

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,280
to try the tutorial which takes you

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,870
step-by-step through a sample

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,300
application all the major features you

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,670
need you want to learn the basics there

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,739
just ate little chapters there and then

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,140
you dive in deeper into the developer's

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,390
guide and learn some more concepts but

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,070
if you want to just answer a question or

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,030
something maybe there's a recipe in the

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,129
cookbook want to know about the methods

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,170
and the internal documentation collect

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,960
that API preview search for it in that

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,960
filter forgot how to do something maybe

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,090
it's on the cheat sheet don't know what

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,100
a word means there's just a few words in

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,240
the vocabulary hey check out the

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,659
glossary you may find something there

00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,490
now we've just added the style guide

00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,590
which shows you how to write an

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,479
application that's clean and like

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,390
everybody else it's got dudes it's got

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,850
don'ts it's got maybes and it's got

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,710
things to avoid and big red so don't do

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:34,380
those things so if we look at one of the

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,369
chapters and we scroll up a little bit

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,650
you're going to find plenty of code

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,329
snippets you look in there you click

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,310
that little box it appears in your

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,280
clipboard you go paste it into something

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,780
and you're good to go not sure about

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,549
that you want to see the whole sample

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,070
well you click that live link your right

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,810
into a plunker and then you can go up

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,240
there you can actually download the

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,909
files from a bunker put it in there

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,670
locally maybe you found something wrong

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:05,159
in app components go in there and say

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:06,840
WTF you create another bug save it

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,780
because it's not real until you save it

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,360
take that link mail it into the issues

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,190
or mail it to a friend

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,830
and there you go but we're not the

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,950
actual code driving this documentation

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:23,660
it's their clone the repo drill down

00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:25,880
public docks examples open up there and

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,220
there are all the chapters and the

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,600
samples behind that they're divided by

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,760
the language that they're implemented in

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,470
there's typescript we can open that in a

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,920
command prompt npm start and it compiles

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:42,590
and up comes a server and there's the

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,770
actual application that's driving the

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:49,100
code you see in the documentation you

00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:53,150
can kill that and you can fire up your

00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,380
favorite code editor and go in there and

00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,090
see the code is it's actually written

00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,630
with all the mark-up that drives the

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,190
documentation now you're saying what

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,959
good is this stuff I mean how many times

00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,040
have I been in documentation and I can't

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,900
trust the code that's in the

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,440
documentation you can trust this code

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,780
because every time we update angular

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,550
we're running that sample code we're

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,310
running into end tests just like the

00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,769
ones you see here so we know that the

00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,170
code that when you get that first

00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:23,060
version of angular the code that you see

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,220
in the documentation is backed by

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,750
end-to-end tests and also you can see

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,600
the end n test so you learn how to do it

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:33,230
who did it no one person did it takes a

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,110
village to do this wonderful people all

00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,600
of them contributing of their time and

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,400
some you know some of them you may not

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,620
know but you'll want to get to know and

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,890
I'm hoping that you will help me with

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:48,019
about 20 seconds here of applause for

00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:52,870
these fine people who are giving you the

00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,870
documentation please keep it coming

00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:07,480
these are great people wonderful people

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:10,180
three two one zero thank you very much

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,820
thank you authors but there's another

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,220
important player in this very important

00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,850
player in all of this and that person is

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,049
you because you can contribute to

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,489
there's easy ways to contribute the

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,530
easiest is going to get hub you see

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:25,690
something you don't like find the

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:28,060
chapter go in an air hit that little

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,700
pencil and start editing we hate the

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,740
word though we think that the vow in

00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,340
here is so boring we're going to change

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:38,920
it to the funky fresh that's really

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:42,160
important change submit that one in here

00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,440
let's just go make a commit and you know

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,180
we got we fixed it create a PR make sure

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,390
it's in another branch create the pull

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:52,990
request that I and somebody will give it

00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:55,060
all the attention it deserves got an

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,340
idea for a cookbook that's great we want

00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,400
them go into the issues create something

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,410
that says cookbook idea put your idea in

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,760
there we look forward to seeing them and

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,650
we'll get back to you to see how we can

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,600
take your idea forward and help you get

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,700
it into the guide so what can you do

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,550
again answer Stack Overflow questions

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,640
fix typos fix bugs in the code if you

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,320
can find one and you can define

00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,890
determine the glossary add a link to the

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,990
cook to the API guy to get the cookbook

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:27,540
whatever you do let's make angular great

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,540
