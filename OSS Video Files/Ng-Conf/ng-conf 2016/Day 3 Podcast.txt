00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,460
live at ng-conf this week on our panel

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,639

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,750
hello let me just start off by saying

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,870
it's really cool to not be little

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,480
squares on a computer with you all today

00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:42,809
yeah it's it's really fun to kind of do

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,550
the in-person thing earlier in the year

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,260
I was a build conference and we did a

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,090
couple of live episodes and it's it's

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,670
nice to be able to actually see people

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,090
and see the way they move in the way

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,199
that they interact so to speak until

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,390
they throw the lights up and then you

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,160
can't see anyone again I actually have

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,229
to wear clothes here I like like usually

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,640
like my pajamas to do the show so yeah

00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,830
I'm gonna leave that one no comment

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,409
Jefferson could be a bad thing yes I

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:16,009
know right I won't tell you what I wear

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:19,259
anyway these so we did this last year

00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,460
and usually what we do as adventures

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,439
angular's we just talked about the

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,520
conference there were some things that

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,930
were talked about during the keynote

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,759
there were things that were talked about

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,100
during some of the talks that were

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,350
really interesting there are some things

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,110
that are relatively new that if you were

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,909
paying attention to what the angular

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,290
team puts out there and some what some

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,079
community members put out there they're

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,479
probably not big surprises but if you're

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,420
not following along then there were a

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,670
lot of exciting things announced so to

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,720
start off I'm really curious what what

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,310
did all of you see or hear that was

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,509
exciting or interesting do you think

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,799
people ought to know about here at

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,729
ng-conf start with Jules Oh me well I

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,070
kind of knew what was going to happen

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,630
before we got here so there wasn't a lot

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,670
of surprises

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,680
I think the animation stuff is really

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,229
cool Matthias has done such a great job

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:15,840
with that that's my favorite thing so

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:20,130
far how about you Joe me well your hold

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:23,400
the mic and I am holding a mic let's see

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,709
I really like Scott's talk I like how he

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,030
made some good things to relate to

00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:30,930
learning angular 2 Scott's tuxedo is

00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,650
awesome though they are they are always

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:37,170
awesome I really like Alyssa Nichols

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,170
talk she was our backup speaker and

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,060
spoken a side place we weren't able to

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,340
get it recorded unfortunately but I

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,959
really liked her talk she actually had

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,230
two talks that were on our backup list

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,019
she didn't even know that made it easy

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:55,049
for her to be our backup speaker I

00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:57,360
really liked hers and then I think that

00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,260
Faraday was pretty fun seeing a lot of

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,069
people going around doing a lot of

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:06,090
things how about you caught you I was

00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:07,890
working in other rooms for most she she

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,420
worked hard she did Austin the shot

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,880
we've never like made her part of the

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,739
crew at least not to the level she was

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,040
this year and it was pretty awesome she

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:19,200
killed it for us awesome I am curious

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,120
though since you're around the

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,430
conference and around the attendees you

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,109
see people walking down the hall what's

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,150
kind of your read on the conference I

00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:29,010
mean what what are people feeling or

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,870
thinking or you know what do you pick up

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,700
when you see people walking through the

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,090
conference so far from everything that

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,040
I've seen everyone will most everyone

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,930
that I've talked to has loved it I've

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,209
heard very few complaints about it and

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,489
the conference even though it's such a

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,100
huge leap we more than doubled it from

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,139
what it was last year so it's i know

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,670
from being around him and being around

00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:52,940
sending everyone that it was really

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,819
really hard to like get it all together

00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,889
but I've heard very very few complaints

00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:00,900
about how the conference is going and

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:02,430
it's really cool to hear people and see

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,190
people just having a good time and

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,810
enjoying the conference

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,520
cool that's kind of what I've been

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,500
seeing too so it's good to hear it

00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:15,300
because I haven't been looking for it I

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,430
guess but what about you John I think

00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,100
the the energy level is not surprising

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,959
but it's it's still awesome to see

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,060
everybody walking around and having

00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,100
great conversations congratulating

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,590
everybody else pending speaker staff

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,720
everybody super friendly this is one of

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,030
my favorite conferences because you have

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,040
real conversations with people and it's

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,930
just the right size it's not too big

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,980
where you can't you get lost and it's

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,170
not too small where you're seeing the

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,700
same person every five seconds so it's a

00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,030
really good size really good energy in

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:49,320
the conference level but what did you

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:55,250
see frosty so I've never done karaoke

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:58,650
before in my life he seriously ever and

00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,660
so on the party night on wednesday night

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,010
there was karaoke it was like like me

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,100
and my twin brother my older brother my

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,600
sister like 10 other people it was so

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,160
much fun i was like we're doing it again

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,310
tomorrow night and so last night until

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,750
like 1230 and night we had so much like

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:18,660
a Theo singing I sing mishka saying

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,090
Michiko did his first karaoke Papa

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,830
Miguel to introduce them Papa me scare

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:27,750
school but no the community it I don't

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:31,620
know why it surprises me every time but

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:33,950
it's the best like every time I come

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,870
here it's like I have 1400 friends and

00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:40,080
I've some of them I met once or twice

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,760
but it's like the hug is just as if I I

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,640
saw my work every day or something so

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,919
it's a lot of fun the communities is

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,800
absolutely untouchable as far as awesome

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,139
communities go

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,650
so one one thing that I wanted to just

00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:56,629
mention that it kind of hit home during

00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,220
one of the keynotes and it was when

00:05:56,629 --> 00:06:00,319
Jules was bringing different people on a

00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,759
stage and they were talking about what

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,819
they were doing with angular with native

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,639
script or with some of the other ways

00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:09,800
you can use angular the angular has

00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,830
become a platform as opposed to just a

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,810
framework and seeing that it can be used

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,360
in all these different areas I mean

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,940
there was a freaking Simon game right

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,569
that you could play and so people are

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,009
using it in IOT and that it's just

00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:28,099
something that's really cool to me that

00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,659
I thought was an interesting thing that

00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:32,150
it seems like the angular team is really

00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:33,469
focused on it's it's funny because a lot

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,500
of people are like oh no we're not a

00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:38,509
framework work we're smaller than or

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,569
different than what a framework is we're

00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:43,009
kind of going smaller and angular is

00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:45,349
like now we're bigger where platform

00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:48,379
where we jumped the framework straighter

00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:49,819
to platform and so we may be back one

00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,889
will jump in and be a platform or

00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:53,630
someone will fill the framework gap

00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:55,729
because it seems like no one wants to be

00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,740
a framework seems like there's i could

00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:00,740
divide some people are going to under

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,240
framework and angular's saying we want

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,979
to fill something bigger which is a

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,469
platform and so that's something that

00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:07,940
I've noticed and I thought was cool too

00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:09,139
so what I've been really noticing two is

00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,539
the big announcement this week obviously

00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,789
and i think the jewels a direct feedback

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:15,919
live here i think it guys under sold how

00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:19,340
important the RC was this week in our

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,110
keynote the RC is huge to have a release

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,539
candidate out there that people can rely

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,190
on go it's great that it's out that was

00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:27,529
the biggest thing for me and then

00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,539
somebody asked me just recently about

00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:32,770
how do you compare into a two- one in a

00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:37,009
nutshell i thought let's see it's faster

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:39,319
it's smaller and it's easier and you

00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:41,180
didn't lose any features so what's

00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,900
what's the downside I'm still waiting

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,550
for the downside trolls when's it coming

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,169
hopefully never but with regard to the

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,980
RC i think maybe i can give you guys

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:51,410
some

00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,420
of the the background story we actually

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,670
talked a lot about whether we should do

00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,260
an RC and whether how it would be

00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:59,660
perceived if we did it for Angie cough

00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,400
where we really ready for RC should we

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,440
just release a final you know there's

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,650
believe it or not we actually super care

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,850
about how we deliver this and how people

00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,200
will perceive it and whether it was

00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,900
ready and we didn't want to do it just

00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,120
for Angie comp and I remember we had

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:17,510
this meeting where there was a very long

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,640
discussion about the perception of our

00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,730
see here at ng comp because not all of

00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,870
the bits are done and you know I asked

00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:26,030
the question because I get to play

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,280
devil's advocate in my role an awful lot

00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,470
and I said well you know is all the main

00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,960
pieces good and stable and they were

00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,419
like yeah but you know we test these on

00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,400
hundreds of internal apps and we know

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,020
how they perform and we know the issues

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,450
with lots of use cases that many

00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,800
businesses have and I think it was Igor

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,300
made the comment but we really need to

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,500
know how other people will use it and I

00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,000
was like well then that's the right time

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,620
to release RC and we need to get up

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,330
there and say you know this is we think

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,980
it's stable and we've hopefully

00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,590
identified all the pieces that we don't

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,750
think are stable but we can't make it

00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,520
final until we know it works for you we

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,500
know it works for google doesn't work

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,240
for you guys and so I think that was a

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,120
lot of the thinking behind should we do

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,710
this is it ready and I think like what

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,520
is our see me to most people and I think

00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,920
it means something slightly different

00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,450
everybody but to me and ice Rick and

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,760
Microsoft we had these similar kinds of

00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:16,100
conversations about products are see

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,200
generally feels to me like it's the time

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,180
when the company is saying go forth and

00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,340
use this in a production app we will

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,410
back you will go forward and maybe

00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,630
there's edge cases that won't work we'll

00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,760
tweak it but the core piece in angular

00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,470
like angular core that should be solid

00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,760
maybe there's an out water like

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,220
internationalisation or something that

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,560
is ready but so to me it was a great

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,090
endorsement of we're ready for you to go

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,940
use this and I think it's a few were

00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:44,270
waiting for I think they got that yeah I

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:49,160
I totally agree with that what you said

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:51,770
John because i love angular 1 a lot but

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,960
i know its legacy code even when I'm

00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,930
riding one out 5 which is the greatest

00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:00,860
singular one I know its legacy codes

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:03,680
and I have a huge interest financially

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:06,620
like for work and personally to stop

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,130
writing legacy code so the sooner this

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:13,220
thing gets into an RC and I can know if

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:15,440
I wrote this today and when I ship it by

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:19,339
christmas or whatever it's going to be

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,830
you know general release likely so for

00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:23,330
me it was huge to know I can start using

00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,950
something knowing that i'm not writing

00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,779
legacy code anymore i can start saving

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,720
money for the business and start getting

00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:31,760
us into where we need to be going

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,089
forward so that's why i agree i think it

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,880
was huge yeah for me you know along the

00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:40,399
same lines having a release candidate is

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:45,320
hey we think we're done or we think

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:49,279
we're close and you know as Jewell said

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,770
it's we all at this point if we want it

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,010
to work for us this is the time to make

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:57,140
sure that they know when it doesn't and

00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,899
so they think it's done or they think

00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:03,400
it's you know stable and so yeah it's

00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:06,290
it's it's our time now to plug it in

00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:10,130
figure it out because there's it's not

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:12,529
as volatile as a beta or an alpha and so

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,000
you know hook it up and let's really see

00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:15,589
what it does and let's say there's

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,510
changes that come I just watched Mike

00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:19,190
Rockies talk but the CLI one of the

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,800
things they're working on is hey I've

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,930
used a CLI to develop an app we are

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,880
promising or at least hoping to have a

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,190
way to help give you hints on how to

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,930
upgrade that moving forward like it like

00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,930
the energy for syntax recently changed

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,970
before RC and I imagine if the CLI was

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,250
to do something about that I would say

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,720
hey here's your energy for syntax would

00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,950
you like me to change that for you and

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,020
it could flip the switch in there and go

00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,550
run through your coat that's cool and

00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,650
let me just follow up the rest of this

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,570
conversation with you know i i'm not one

00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,640
of the engineers actually building this

00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,010
product but I've been on a lot of

00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,470
product teams at launch and I've never

00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,270
seen a group of engineers come together

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,649
over some late changes that we knew were

00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,350
significant and big

00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:02,300
and pulling all-nighters and really

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,399
putting their soul into making sure that

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,499
we gave speakers enough notice you

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,899
adjust their code I've seen a lot of day

00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:10,839
use about how amazing it was that the

00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:13,279
code was up to date you know coming here

00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:16,040
and also making the decisions that were

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,589
right instead of just pushing forward to

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,179
get to RC for this conference they they

00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:21,319
really went out of their way to say we

00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:23,290
could do this it wouldn't be the right

00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:26,300
thing long-term so let's just you know

00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,699
bust our butts and get it done and

00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,740
that's what they did I'm really curious

00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:32,990
Jules because it sounds like the angular

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,689
team did a lot of preparation for this

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:38,389
conference and I can kind of imagine why

00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:43,220
I mean this is a large group of people

00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:46,279
who use angular what what's the message

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,649
that they really wanted us to get I mean

00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:51,290
I saw a lot of things in the keynotes I

00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:53,809
I got a lot of ideas of things that I

00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,490
could do with angular but but what are

00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:57,740
kind of the key things that they were

00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:01,429
trying to get across to us as angular

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:03,589
developers and communicate to us that we

00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:06,259
could do or should do or should think

00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:08,059
about with angular I think that's a huge

00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:09,559
question right like there's so many

00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:11,240
different things that you can use with

00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,459
angular because it's not just the simple

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,439
framework anymore so I think our goal

00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,540
was to try to give as much of a broad

00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:20,149
view of what's what it's going to be in

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,189
its totality while still being true and

00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:25,850
honest where it actually is right now

00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:27,079
today for you I mean I could go through

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,449
all the things we put in the keynote but

00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:30,889
you could obviously go and reread that

00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:32,749
and we spent a lot of time you know

00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:34,399
reiterating that keynote to make sure it

00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:37,670
said exactly what those messages were

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,769
that we wanted you guys to hear but I

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,029
think the other thing we really you know

00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:43,059
here's something I'm going to say

00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:46,160
because I don't think people realize it

00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:49,730
ng-conf is not run by us we don't make

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,290
it we don't pay for it and if the

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,720
listeners don't realize that the first

00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,119
ng-conf you guys mortgaged our houses to

00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,430
pull this together and really make it or

00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:59,960
what

00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:03,390
no I don't mean that literally but but

00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:06,240
we came this close to doing exactly that

00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:07,649
mortgage housing mortgaging was like on

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,300
the table that's what that was a

00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:12,240
discussion that I believe I had heard

00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:15,000
that story oh but and my point is is

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,279
that you know we feel a commitment to

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,810
you guys who have shown so much love to

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,089
angular and to the community that comes

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:24,240
here every year to view it and I think

00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:25,890
that's the biggest message that if Brad

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,380
was here he'd want to say is it's all

00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:32,940
about you and your feedback to us and

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,920
we're listening awesome you know you did

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,060
address the organizers and I'm kind of

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,290
curious I want to ask a similar question

00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:42,570
to Joe and Aaron who are up here what is

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,220
your goal within G cough what are you

00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,470
hoping that people come away from edgy

00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:50,370
cop with is it a connection to the

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:53,970
angular team is it better skills to do

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:55,830
cool stuff with angular just a fun

00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,750
experience I mean Faraday seemed like it

00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,330
was pretty focused on that among other

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:04,500
things what are you looking at people

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:07,410
getting out of the conference I think

00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,380
that we all have a very unified vision

00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,459
on ng-conf was to what we what we as

00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,850
organizers want to get out of the

00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:17,730
conference and that's obviously it's for

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:20,220
us very obviously to fold and the first

00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,320
one came up in angular air episode that

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,900
we were on last week where they were

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,490
asking us what they want people to take

00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,290
away and that was the community at

00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,240
angular is awesome so for us number one

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,010
priority is of this conference is to

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,020
building in the community and to that

00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,510
like we have the whole extended thing

00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,339
that goes on right very few conference a

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,010
lot of conferences stream the very few

00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,540
conferences spend time because it's just

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,520
it takes a lot of time and energy and

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,260
money to do this a few conferences can

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,600
spend the time to actually try to make

00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,940
those that are watching remotely feel

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,000
more like part of what's going on so

00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:56,220
this is all errands doing a year to he

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
had the idea let's do this and took it

00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,880
under his wing and did a ton of work and

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,260
effort and now we've turned over can you

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,490
guys explain a little bit to people

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,870
listening what ng

00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,810
extended really is besides watching

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:10,290
large sphere and can so it's an idea

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:12,060
that we borrowed from google when they

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,820
do google i/o yearly they do Google i/o

00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,800
extended switch is they organize remote

00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:20,130
viewing parties around the globe and

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,529
they encourage the organizers to be in

00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:23,790
touch with them to get some little bit

00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:26,220
of behind-the-scenes information about

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,839
what will be going on and and to be

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,200
there you know liaison for those remote

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,660
groups set up ticketing and or get

00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,790
venues and trying to do t-shirts or food

00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,980
whatever you can so we borrowed that

00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,899
same idea cuz I ran a couple extended

00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,930
and they IO extended and they went well

00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:45,060
they went really well so we thought it

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:48,720
would be amazing to bring on extended ng

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:51,750
Kafka's year to we we were in a venue

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,560
that let us have 700 people and we got

00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:57,570
beat up to four only doing seven other

00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,980
people to come and so we needed to get

00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:01,980
some a bit different way for people to

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,510
enjoy ng conference is a community did

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,949
the tickets sell out last year and so

00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,079
for last year's from like 10 minutes or

00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:08,670
something yeah I mean if the server's

00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,640
hadn't crashed a little in seconds right

00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:14,280
like it it's insane Angie anything that

00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,530
really wrote anything any car that ropes

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,240
itself to the angular horse is on its

00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:21,120
its it needs to be ready for a ride

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,699
because you it gets crazy once you're

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,589
attached to the angular team so yeah but

00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,300
that's that was like a big piece the

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:30,150
message we want is about building

00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,950
bridges for other people and making the

00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:35,280
community the best that it possibly can

00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:38,340
be then so well to that and the other

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,050
aspect of that was we wanted ng-conf to

00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,260
be the kind of conference that we wanted

00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:45,600
to attend right like there's a style and

00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,860
a flavor to a conference and not

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,210
everybody that's going to come to this

00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,530
conference is going to appreciate it as

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,470
much as a different kind of conference

00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:54,000
right and that's okay we're totally okay

00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,200
with that we want this to be a

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,540
conference that as many people as

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,429
possible can enjoy but when we decide do

00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,620
we do hey or do we do be we always

00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:04,140
decide what what we like to have if we

00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,570
went to a conference and so

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,760
that's our that's kind of our goal into

00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:11,910
organizing I have to say mission

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,800
accomplished because I I showed up and

00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:16,800
this is based on my experience last year

00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,540
and now this year I tracked Sonny down

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,460
and I said what would it take to do a

00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:24,000
podcasting conference like this because

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:26,370
I mean this it's it's a fairly unique

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,520
conference in the sense that you know we

00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,080
we all it's all single track which in a

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,390
venue like this usually don't get

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,040
usually they put the partitions up and

00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,290
you have you know two or three tracks

00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,410
going at a time except for the keynotes

00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:43,500
and then just all of the extra stuff so

00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:46,290
we showed up or I showed up you know I

00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,980
live here so I parked under the hotel

00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:51,870
and you know came up and there was a

00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,150
cantina band and there were you know

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:58,140
just fun elements it was not just

00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:59,820
angular it was hey look you know work

00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,080
we're gonna have some flavor we're going

00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,750
to have some culture we're going to have

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,780
some some some good feeling and just all

00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,730
around fun and then fair day it was well

00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:11,730
do you want to go to the native strip

00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:14,100
one or the CLI one or do you want to go

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,200
learn to play the ukulele you know have

00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,290
some chocolate-covered bacon I mean just

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,570
just the overall feeling of hey look you

00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,820
know this isn't all serious and work and

00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,830
stuff we love what we do and we're going

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,870
to do some stuff that we love to do I

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:31,470
didn't have the chocolate covered bacon

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:34,140
how was it who was really good he done

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,390
messed up cuz it was good it was weird

00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:39,000
that's what we know is what I thought it

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,530
would be well bacon I don't know

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,470
together that sounds kind of weird to me

00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,210
though deep-fried Twinkies were the best

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,950
just saying yeah you put them together

00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,470
you get a heart attack I thought the

00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,510
bakery a baker at bacon was the best but

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:55,050
I must have missed that I could be

00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,790
insane but it was amazing you know we

00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,050
were talk about the extended counts and

00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,420
it's actually helped me build a bridge

00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:02,760
so for example I'm going to Barcelona

00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:05,460
that this summer and get Revere's games

00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,380
for that the angular beers awesome name

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,070
for a group right yeah over there I

00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,450
happen to

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,280
ask the guy said hey you know your guys

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,320
are going to be putting together some

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,670
stuff would you like to organize a day

00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,400
where Dan want leaner I go to Barcelona

00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,200
and this guy and within a day he'd set

00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,060
up a 24-hour turnaround an event that

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,040
we're gonna be doing over in Barcelona

00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,140
now this summer on is awesome by the way

00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,670
those guys are great your partner's over

00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,620
there are great those guys are really

00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,810
really cool they did a great job they

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,730
ran ng-conf extended and I saw many of

00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:35,550
the pictures wonderful job they ran it

00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,930
in a movie theater and like the ads were

00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,240
on the movie theater screens everything

00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,190
I mean they went way way way up it was

00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,260
it was our I think the biggest ng-conf

00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,760
extent was theirs yeah they created a

00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,380
slack channel that I joined the internet

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,510
was 300 people in that room soon as the

00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,890
selection opened okay so it's great such

00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:54,900
communities that are out there talking

00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:56,430
yes I think the another thing that's

00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,710
worth mentioning about how we organize

00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:01,080
is the principles under which under

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,370
which we organize right so our probably

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,770
our number one principle is that our

00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:07,650
conference is welcoming right every

00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:09,450
decision that we make we look at is this

00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,950
a welcoming is this is something that

00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,990
we're doing welcoming right we're okay

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,640
if people don't like Star Wars right

00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:17,160
you're not just trying to shove to Star

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,520
Wars as we girl walks up the hard work

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:22,950
bail is not Gordo enters the room my

00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:26,610
first words it comes in like a demon

00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:28,170
that was summoned by incantation did you

00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,790
know that ward bell actually they gave

00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,830
away these awesome lego star wars sets

00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,420
of speakers thank you my son will love

00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,360
that grabber Norville actually gave me

00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:40,020
his that's hehe star wars that much or

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:43,930
he loves you that much come up right bye

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:48,710
Jules he coming upward all right

00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:51,020
we are the Holland Ward is a wart and I

00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,970
have a fun time and John we all have a

00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,080
fun time messing around with the Star

00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:58,940
Wars but we're okay if somebody doesn't

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,790
enjoy one of the activities that goes on

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,590
but if they don't feel welcome we want

00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,720
to know why we want to work to make sure

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,040
that we don't have activity do things

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,810
that don't make anybody feel welcome so

00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,760
that's one of our principles another one

00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:12,710
of our principles is it's about the

00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,870
education we throw all the fun on that

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:17,420
we want but if the education isn't there

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:19,040
then we have a problem right so every

00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,560
time we talk about what fun we're going

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:25,700
to do we make sure that behind that is

00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:29,390
good content so like one thing just to

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:32,660
kind of like a an actual case what Joe

00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:34,730
is talking about so this year the we

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,000
have these wacky speaker intros does

00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:39,920
anyone notice the crazy speaker intros

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
the people in the audience in viewing on

00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,340
the live stream I don't think that they

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,950
know I think they think that Dave and I

00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:48,050
wrote the intros so they might think

00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,630
it's silly the beautiful thing is that

00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:53,570
the speaker's wrote the intros about

00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:55,550
each other so we assigns all on speaker

00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,800
to intro another speaker and then that

00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:02,660
person would in turn intro them for the

00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:06,170
angular team we had the most funny

00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:08,090
person on the team oh he's here too yeah

00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,440
Jules looks right at Jeff we had Jeff

00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,050
write the integrals for the angular team

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,150
he is but looks aren't everything so we

00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:16,370
make sure the toxic killer I make sure

00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,870
the toxic killer but then we tried to

00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:19,340
just show some fun around it to make it

00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:22,310
entertaining because you're in a room

00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:25,190
for seven hours and it can be tough am i

00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:28,010
right so you guys did an intro with me

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,420
and mentioned I worked in a prison and I

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,220
thought that is real I need to know if

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,690
that was real they did I was getting

00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,340
text message from people on the angular

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,930
team even going hey that's really great

00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,920
that you do that can you help out my

00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,900
friend I believe

00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:43,370
he looks like he worked in a prison cell

00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:45,320
thanks Joe yeah but that said I mean

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,760
even the star wars party I mean there

00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,420
were Star Wars stuff all over the place

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,040
on on what tooth Wednesday when San Ward

00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,650
was holding a lightsaber by the way I

00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:57,230
have pictures seem to know videos of

00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:59,840
water actually had a neighbor dual

00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:02,210
angular team with the lightsaber my foot

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,690
says you don't like this true work is

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:07,670
this true uh yeah I got into a fencing

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,830
match with nyomi with the light safe I

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:12,590
have video are not video caller but I

00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:15,290
can understand them or whatever in Star

00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,940
Wars but the thing is is like you come

00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:19,820
to these bins you go to the after party

00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,530
it's a star wars-themed after party but

00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:26,660
the great thing is is you can you can

00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:30,050
walk in you know they had hiked poker

00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:31,640
tables and stuff up in here and if that

00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:33,710
wasn't your speed then you could go talk

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,050
to people you know in the little foyer

00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,960
area out there or the dueling pianos

00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,670
yeah yeah yeah but they're carry or so

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,770
many people so many great people here

00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,840
that you know it really doesn't matter

00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:47,930
you know so you could talk to some crazy

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,750
guy who was wearing it Jedi robe or you

00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:53,000
could talk to know who is that crazy

00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,880
that's here though is that crazy I don't

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,240
know but John John has the same haircut

00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,770
is that guy anyway you know but but you

00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,600
you know you could you could you could

00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:04,160
find people we all have something in

00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,650
common and there are so many great

00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,600
people here that yeah I mean that

00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:11,060
welcoming aspect and it comes out of the

00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,980
community as much as how the conference

00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:15,200
is organized I hope that doesn't hurt

00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,240
anyone's feelings but you know it really

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,180
is we have a terrific community and then

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,980
it's hey just come and be part of the

00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:25,110
group

00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:26,789
absolutely so we talked a little about

00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:29,220
the sessions and some of our favorite

00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,149
ones but I think it's really important

00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,950
to note that I think one reason we

00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:33,629
didn't talk too much about them is a

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,820
good conference doesn't mean great

00:25:33,629 --> 00:25:37,139
sessions I mean it's nice to have the

00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,299
sessions but that's not the reason you

00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:40,799
go I mean at least it's not why I go I

00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:42,899
can watch them on the internet watch on

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,580
youtube it's the camaraderie with the

00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:46,740
people it's the conversations we're

00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,809
having to can't have unless you're here

00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,250
with these people all the time and I've

00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:52,590
learned so much with so many people

00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,299
feedback they're giving us about how

00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,860
they use angular problems are trying to

00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:58,440
solve what they like what they don't

00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:01,559
like that stuff you just can't get it's

00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,240
like a 1400 person focus group so to me

00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,590
that's really valuable to see what you

00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,059
want to do yeah can I tell a story

00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,860
really quick about that because I was

00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:10,320
sitting at lunch I think it was

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:13,289
yesterday and I was talking to a few

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,029
people and somebody mentioned that their

00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:16,919
biggest problem was there build process

00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:19,289
and they mentioned that they have people

00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:22,259
working on different parts of the front

00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:25,620
end and then no I think it was a dinner

00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:26,909
last night anyway so they were saying

00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,200
you know they're like 14 different

00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:30,750
pieces that have to get pulled together

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,769
as part of their build process and just

00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,330
sitting there and kind of thinking

00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:36,210
through a problem that I had never even

00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:38,279
considered was an issue I mean cuz most

00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,990
of the angular I've done backs up onto a

00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:43,379
rails application and it's all kind of

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:46,379
just part of the same blob and so you

00:26:43,379 --> 00:26:49,320
get to see that it's like oh ok so then

00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:51,659
they're looking at web packer JSP em or

00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,759
system j s or whatever through a

00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:55,500
completely different lens than i am and

00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,529
how do we solve that problem how do we

00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,509
look at these things and you know just

00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:03,509
just hearing how people deal with that

00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:05,460
or you know well i found testing this

00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:07,059
particular type of component was really

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,279
hard i've heard that a few times

00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:11,049
and just just kind of figuring out how

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,249
people think about this or hearing

00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:15,100
people talk about how they plan to use

00:27:12,249 --> 00:27:17,440
the CLI it's all of that stuff that's

00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,059
that's the magic here and if you come

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,669
here with a problem there's probably

00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:23,590
somebody here with a solution and I've

00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:25,749
seen this at multiple conferences where

00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:27,490
I have come to the conference trying to

00:27:25,749 --> 00:27:30,700
figure something out I talked to a few

00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:32,710
people and they all say well that guy is

00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,559
the guy you want to talk about or go

00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,749
talk to and then other people will help

00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:39,129
me find that particular person because

00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:40,899
they have the expertise that I need and

00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:43,679
you just yeah you can't get that

00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:43,679
anywhere else

00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:50,260
so Ward what did you think of the

00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:53,140
conference that you just join us well I

00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:54,610
loved it and I loved it for all the

00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,520
reasons that you described there's an

00:27:54,610 --> 00:28:00,690
enormous number of hallway conversations

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:04,180
that go places that you weren't even

00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:06,220
knowing that you could go and there's a

00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:08,830
friendliness to it in an openness to

00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,650
talking and sharing uncertainties that

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:14,890
we all have and are uncomfortable

00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:16,480
sharing that comes right out there were

00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:19,300
a number of things that were done at the

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,010
conference to promote that they asked me

00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:24,340
anything's we're really cool because

00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:26,800
people would do it there but it could be

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:29,170
you're standing in line to get a get a

00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,610
drink of some song and you're you're

00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:32,380
there in that line and you that's an

00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:35,470
opportunity for us to turn to each other

00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:39,670
somebody you don't know and then have

00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:41,530
your mind blown I would also say though

00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,940
that the sessions were very strong the

00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,530
prep the formal presentations for which

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,210
we were all gathered together we all saw

00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,910
at the same time we're very strong and

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:51,370
there was one in particular maybe you

00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:53,880
all called it out already that I I was

00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:57,670
deeply moved by which was Tarot's

00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:02,110
generative art one that one that took me

00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:05,560
to a different place it brought

00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:09,130
computing to the soul somehow and I

00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:11,020
admire that one a lot and I hope that

00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,640
one of the things seeing something like

00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:15,340
that can do is make me think about how I

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,400
present my own stuff in the future and

00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:22,600
to try and touch people that talk I

00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:24,100
think that talk was amazing and not to

00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,440
kind of go with what John was talking

00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,780
about that's what you get when you come

00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:32,080
like it's one thing to hear his talk but

00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:33,700
to come here and meet taro it's like the

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,540
next level because he's one of the

00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:39,090
nicest people ever and his talk I think

00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,590
it meant a lot to a lot of people and

00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:44,650
like the native script team that's here

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:47,620
they went and they modded his repo or

00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:49,230
whatever and they've built it as in the

00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,150
native iOS and Android

00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:53,160
now using native script and they

00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:56,700
deployed it to the app store or to the

00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:58,530
Play Store so let's talk like in

00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,210
particularly is a focus point for a lot

00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:05,940
of really cool things that happened here

00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:08,820
I agree so I'm curious specifically John

00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,740
Ward as speakers one of the things that

00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:11,850
we did this year which was I think a

00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,770
little bit different as we kind of gave

00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,900
speakers assignments besides just

00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:18,750
speaking right in addition to speaking

00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:21,059
you had to do your am a kind of Q&A

00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:24,120
session which isn't that unusual but we

00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:25,020
also had two rooms a tour of Heroes room

00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,510
where people could go and walk through

00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,820
the tutorial on angular 2 and we have an

00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:32,309
expert's room as well and we asked

00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:34,830
speakers we actually assigned speakers a

00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:36,210
couple hours during on Faraday that they

00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,429
needed to be in the room and be there

00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,990
for attendees and we I've had

00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:41,610
conversations with Jonna bah he loves

00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:43,290
the hallway conversations and this is

00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:44,910
almost like you want a hallway

00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,140
conversation it might happen in the

00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,059
hallway but if you go to this room it

00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,169
will happen so for you guys and the time

00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:52,290
that you spend on those rooms what was

00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:54,809
your impression and experiences there it

00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:56,700
was fantastic over those who don't quite

00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:58,559
understand all the details of jobs you

00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:00,419
weren't here there was a true heroes

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,250
room which people could come in and work

00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:04,290
on the tour's tutorial and we would help

00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,059
you were four or five people in the room

00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,679
of time there was another room they ask

00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:09,960
me anything think people experienced

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,090
that before experts rooms we also had

00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,340
side sessions too and those side

00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:16,230
sessions were packed which was amazing I

00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,210
could barely get to the stage when I was

00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:19,350
five minutes late to getting here does

00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,330
trying to run from a to her euros room

00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:23,820
to that one when dan and I were speaking

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:25,890
but to me it was great I was exhausted

00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:28,110
yesterday I think it hits six of those

00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:30,570
and if at the end of it I looked like I

00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:32,490
probably looked it but it was amazing i

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,799
love all the people i got to speak with

00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:39,000
i wish every conference would do that

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:42,660
honestly that is really cool i was going

00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,640
to just say I agree we need these kinds

00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:51,210
of opportunities to meet with people and

00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:53,010
saw so see them selves problems and

00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,929
the hallway encounters are great but

00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,580
this is this this broke some of the

00:31:54,929 --> 00:32:00,059
barriers to people talking to each other

00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:02,640
it was exhausting problems exhausting

00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:04,070
for them is for us but it got us there's

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,149
no sitting around in the speaker room

00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:08,700
which is what happens at a lot of

00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:09,899
conferences we're not having a speaker

00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,340
yeah thanks for yeah we don't need a

00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:13,049
speaker room that our speaker room is

00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,980
right out there with with the people who

00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:18,480
are coming and attending and and having

00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,190
them look us right in the face and say

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,320
then this this doesn't make any sense to

00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,149
me that's that's gold that that's a new

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,220
wave to I gotta say this cuz I help

00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:27,419
share some other conferences I don't run

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,649
them like you guys didn't help chair

00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:30,870
them and I've been trying to bring this

00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:33,210
idea to them that people here pay to

00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,799
interact with everybody that's what

00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,690
they're here to interact not just to

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,730
hear the session and when speakers go

00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:40,770
hide in a room for eight hours and you

00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,630
never see them you lose that interaction

00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:44,190
and they are going to hear back as

00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:47,370
speakers or like well I need the time to

00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,720
prepare you've had six months so come

00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:51,270
here and talk to people where else can I

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,909
need everybody so that's something great

00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:55,770
I wrote I like a lot that your comment

00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:57,059
kind of brings brings us back to a point

00:32:55,770 --> 00:33:00,210
that Joe is talking about that I wanted

00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:01,919
to come back to anyway one of the point

00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,960
one of the purposes we have like one of

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,600
the outcomes we hope for him that we

00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:09,330
have because we have multiple but along

00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,730
the way Jill mentioned that this is an

00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,770
angular team's conference but we try and

00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:16,740
respect as many of the things that Jules

00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:18,600
or her team's going to ask for and one

00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,539
of the things I've asked for is we need

00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,309
a chance to say hi to every attendee

00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:27,630
like every tiny needs to meet at least

00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:30,149
one of the court see members and so part

00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:32,039
of what we do is to try and make it an

00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:34,200
environment where that your team can be

00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:36,419
available for anyone who wants you to

00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,370
come up say hi to them they need to be

00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:41,279
approachable and there they've agreed to

00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:43,169
be there and to welcome anyone who wants

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,490
to come up and talk to them and so part

00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:46,220
of our goal like another one of the

00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:49,710
goals is to create an environment where

00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:51,659
anyone who wants to can go chat and like

00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,429
meet Jules for the first time which I

00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:55,409
recommend because she's really cool and

00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:57,149
ever since she's come on a team like

00:33:55,409 --> 00:34:00,779
I've had a lot more fun

00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:03,210
so that's another one of our big goals

00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:04,649
is because that's one of their because

00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:06,659
they've asked us to do a few things but

00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:08,010
that's one of the more one of the more

00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:10,950
things the things are their moisture so

00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:12,419
that is we need to be everyone so so

00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:14,760
yeah so because if you said hi to

00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:16,770
everybody yet hi everybody here want to

00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,760
say hi to Jules count three one two

00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:23,909
three there you go you just solved half

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:29,069
the conference she was nice to me ready

00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:30,329
for next year all right well I I want to

00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:33,149
make sure that we're respectable time

00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:36,589
that there is I just wanted to mention

00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:39,210
shiz talk because I love every year that

00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:41,309
there's there's something just to to

00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:44,460
laugh at and it's something that is

00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:46,470
specific to us right we're all insiders

00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,419
and it's all inside jokes and it's just

00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:50,190
it just adds another flavor to the

00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:53,460
conference so last year was ng wat this

00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:55,710
year was the ng show which I thought was

00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,510
kind of a fun name there I mentioned

00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:00,119
that I did that when I was here last

00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:01,559
year at ng-conf I didn't work on the

00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:03,990
angular team never planned to work on

00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:05,760
the angular team I was here just trying

00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,619
to get a vibe for how the developer

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,400
community had moved since the last time

00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:14,160
I was a part of it and in my ng-conf

00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,859
troof report I had a whole paragraph on

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,140
shiz Angie what session they were all

00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:20,940
inside jokes to you guys but the thing

00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,740
that I saw from I actually cried in the

00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,420
audience last year's it was so funny and

00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,950
I didn't even know what any of the

00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,230
things meant Freight I never used

00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:30,210
angular at that point but the thing that

00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,799
it showed me last year and like when I

00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,750
had the opportunity to meet Brad and

00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:35,460
they asked me to join a team I kind of

00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:37,890
went back to that moment of sitting in

00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,720
the audience last year and hearing

00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:42,720
everybody just really come together over

00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,339
these you know funny things and and I'm

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,990
it was an amazing experience for me

00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:47,130
being external to the team at the time

00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:49,140
and then to be able to sit in the front

00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,510
row and see the one this year and know a

00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:53,839
lot of what's behind it was really this

00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,890
a great session

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:58,289
so one last thing I kind of want to

00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:59,970
bring up is there are a lot of talks and

00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:03,180
they happen really fast I mean some of

00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:05,279
them in 20 minutes right so you know you

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,650
kind of just get that taste of something

00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:11,130
and then it moves on to something else

00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:12,750
and I think sometimes I come to these

00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:14,760
conferences and I'm like you know I'd

00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,859
really like to go get a deep dive but

00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,329
the flip side of it is is that I kind of

00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:22,019
get to see a little bit of everything

00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:23,579
and then move ahead with that I wonder

00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:25,529
how deliberate that is though with the

00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:28,380
conference format when you think about

00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:30,059
that are you looking at these topics and

00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:34,950
going yeah that's a 20 minute topic and

00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:37,440
that's a 45 minute topic sometimes we we

00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:41,039
don't really do 45 minute topics so

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,829
before we did ng come Joe and Dave and

00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:46,890
myself had spoken quite a bit at

00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:48,569
conferences around and and gone to a lot

00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:51,240
of conferences well I know a lot of us

00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:53,099
in the room have and you get there and

00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,049
when you have a 60-minute talk on 45

00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:56,910
minute talk the talk actually last 30

00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:58,890
minutes or 45 minutes when it's a 68

00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,660
talk and then there's 15 minutes of

00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:03,450
fluff so that means you got a 10 minute

00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,950
intro of who they are and you got to sit

00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,529
and listen to John talk about everything

00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:10,349
he's done including the prison work and

00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:12,690
every repos ever owned and in what else

00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:14,819
right and then after 10 minutes in a

00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:16,109
warm up he'll actually do some wait a

00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:18,329
minute you're not going to take away my

00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:22,200
that's 10 minutes of John's time in

00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:23,849
prison are you no no so it's and so we

00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,740
were like we're done with that that's

00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:28,470
not a talk that's going to happen if

00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:30,390
we're organizing these talks will have

00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,069
zero time to enjoy yourself other than

00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:35,309
your name and your Twitter handle and

00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:37,650
then you cut at that point you've got 19

00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:39,059
minutes and 40 seconds left to actually

00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:42,140
get your point across which is not easy

00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:45,089
and and in John smoke innumerable times

00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:47,700
the ward spoken or multiple times they

00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:49,200
know is cocky as spoken here it's not

00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,609
easy to fit your talk at that time limit

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,799
so that's what we're doing we're

00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:54,420
challenging the speakers to get to go

00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:55,840
straight to the point and there's no

00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:00,410
fluff so

00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:02,030
when it's that intense though it has to

00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,940
be a lot of fun as well because yeah

00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:06,710
about end of the day your brains like I

00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:08,660
I'm shutting down now right like it's

00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:11,420
it's over so unless you put an electrode

00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,950
in it you could do that but it's great

00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,710
because if you come to a conference

00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:17,330
wanting to learn like to learn like a 40

00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,130
hour workshop kind of thing like a week

00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,620
long that's not a conference in my mind

00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:23,450
today I get asked more than any other

00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,860
question at this conference I've been a

00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,930
s and it's every conference how do you

00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,790
keep up with things and one of the ways

00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:31,010
i love with this conference that kind of

00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:33,050
goes with that is because i'm getting so

00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,910
much content information i'm being

00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:36,650
inspired to look into some things other

00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,690
things I saw I'm like that's cool but I

00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:40,400
can't use it right now but I can file it

00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:42,800
away for later know how to get back to

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,770
it I come here to be inspired by topics

00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,510
not to learn every single feature and

00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:49,220
how it works under the covers and you

00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,980
guys provide that Avenue and I think

00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:53,330
that's really viable yep now I know

00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,350
we're up against the time barrier so

00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,990
we're going to go ahead and just go

00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:58,370
straight two pics if you listen to the

00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:01,460
show you know what those are if you

00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:03,710
don't it's just one or two things that

00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,480
make our lives better is kind of the way

00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:08,570
I describe it so could be a TV show that

00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:11,630
makes you laugh or it can be a technical

00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:12,980
tool that makes work easier we'll start

00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:18,140
down here with Ward and we'll just work

00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:20,320
our way down that's terrible man I'm

00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:24,440
just going to say go watch Tarot's talk

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,180
and think about how you can combine your

00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,020
the art and something personal in your

00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:32,180
life with your technology my pick is for

00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:34,940
you and your entire team of people who

00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:37,040
the NGK you know I've been working with

00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:39,020
sunny and you guys for a number of

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,060
months now to try to make sure that this

00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,650
event gets pulled off right but we have

00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,960
everything and I don't think the

00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:46,670
attendees realize how much work this

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,140
team has put into making sure this

00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:50,299
conference is great you show up the

to just kind of do some things that we

00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,090
couldn't do because we had day jobs

00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:53,460
you're too sunny was basically running

00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:55,080
every aspect that didn't involve us

00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,610
making a decision and in year three

00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,760
sunny is one of our decision makers

00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:03,690
right so she's an amazing entrepreneur

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:06,890
an amazing organizer the hole 0 slope of

00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:09,990
its team is awesome she's brought on now

00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:12,780
multiple people that work a lot for her

00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:15,270
and a lot of people that work a little

00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:18,540
for and she has done a great job picking

00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:21,060
staff that are amazing every aspect of

00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:23,520
being an entrepreneur I admire about

00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:26,730
what she does and working with her and

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,850
is a pleasure and having her on our

00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:32,520
organizing committee is just invaluable

00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:34,040
so that's gonna be my pick is sending

00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,260
her staff

00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,760
yeah I'm really quickly since I have a

00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:41,060
moment to shout out I'm gonna pick the

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,970
sponsors you know I think a lot of times

00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:47,600
we we think you know we come in they

00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:50,090
have the boots and you know they want us

00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,590
to come talk to them but honestly a lot

00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,570
of these companies are out there

00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:55,610
providing solutions to our problems and

00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:57,470
we need to take a minute to go see what

00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:59,390
they're about the other thing is is that

00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:01,580
these conferences can't happen without

00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:03,290
them and so the fact that they are

00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,660
generous enough to put some money down

00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:08,900
send some people out to meet us and see

00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:11,930
how they can help us and then you know

00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,580
we we get to show up essentially at a

00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,380
discount because they're covering some

00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,390
of the costs so that we can have a great

00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:20,270
event I just think it's terrific so here

00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:23,090
going to pick them yeah I'll pick the

00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:24,680
spot the organizers again and for

00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,030
different reasons something they do here

00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,130
that's genius that I'm not sure being a

00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,660
live stream can see is in between

00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,580
sessions there's like three minutes

00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:33,530
sometimes five or six and technical

00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,470
difficulties or a speaker not getting up

00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:38,360
there like me and one thing they do is

00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,430
they give away these prizes and the

00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,170
prizes are either one of two categories

00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:44,720
that I've seen the rather something

00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:46,670
really cool or something so bizarre I

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:50,960
have no idea where they found it like a

00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:54,860
vajayjay the jetty what this is a clean

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:57,410
show of vegetables pasta maker yeah

00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:59,000
vegetable spaghetti Ligeti but it keeps

00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,950
people it's genius because they keep

00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,260
people in their seats in between the

00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:05,450
sessions and people don't leave the

00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:07,280
whole day there in this room and they're

00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,870
paying attention and it's fantastic the

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,610
problem is they can't say anyone's name

00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:15,030
unless it's date

00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:17,550
yeah that was that was weird how many

00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:19,530

00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:21,660

00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:31,980

00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,970
