okay hello everyone so today's talk is

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,420
titled look deeply into your app with

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,190
Audrey my name is Igor and this is

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,750
Vanessa and we're both working a

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,949
triangle so first of all what is Audrey

00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,109
well you might have heard about ugly

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,199
before we were formally codenamed bad

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,330
angle and Audrey is a chrome developer

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,099
tools extension that allows you to

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,650
visualize your angular 2 application on

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,780
runtime now to be more specific we think

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,230
of augury as more than just a tool to

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,790
find bugs but more as an aid that gives

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,160
you additional insight into your

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,050
applications behavior at runtime now

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,940
Audrey is an open source effort that we

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,750
started a triangle I oh and it's written

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,250
using typescript and angular 2 so let's

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,100
see where we are coming from with this

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,530
so let's look back at the past so in the

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,750
fall of 2015 we started working on this

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,570
tool we kind of hacked a quick prototype

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,190
in about a week for angular connect as

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,559
you can see on this animation is pretty

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,080
basic but nevertheless it Illustrated an

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,900
important concept of as being able to

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,390
get this information from angular 2 and

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,180
that we could do something with it now

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,830
we went quite far since then I believe

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,590
and we went through several major

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,900
iterations we gathered a lot of feedback

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,180
from internal usability testing as well

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,009
from the community and now we have a

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:30,540
beta version available on the chrome

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:32,130
store so with that in mind let's look a

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:40,409
little bit more deeply into your up with

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:43,290
Vanessa so augury is not just a debugger

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,790
as you all know the demand for complex

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,430
angular application is growing every day

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,049
and as the app gets more and more

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,970
complex they're all these layers and

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,229
layers of abstraction and all these

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,329
information it's really hard to keep

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,759
everything in your head so augury aims

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,979
to make your life a little bit better by

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,290
giving you in size to the dynamic

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,299
behavior of your application so you can

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,259
understand what really is going on under

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,360
the hood it does so by giving you

00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:10,520
graphic representation of component

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,920
relationship

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,270
see hierarchy router structure i'm not

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,250
going to go through the whole list

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,930
because that's a mouthful of words but

00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,850
the idea is that by understanding how

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,860
all these elements tied together us a

00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,980
developer will be able to build better

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:27,230
and more optimized applications so with

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,780
that all that talk of what Audrey can do

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,780
I think we're ready for a demo

00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:43,010
so first thing first you have to install

00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,010
it from the chrome store

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:55,700
checking checking awesome so after

00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:58,379
that's installed you can fire up any

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,440
angular 2 application and there's no

00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:04,800
extra work that needs to be done on your

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,599
end open up the dev tool you should see

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,250
a new tab all the way at the end Calgary

00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:14,340
fry that up we're at the back you will

00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,620
see a list of all the currently loaded

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,360
components in your application sorted by

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,060
the hierarchy and as you roll over

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,519
there's visual cue showing you where

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,170
they're located in the Dom much like the

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,220
elements panel that we're all so

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:31,769
familiar with and any change to the Dom

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,180
tree or sorry the componentry or

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:38,190
components will be highlighted as such

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:41,360
so that's all just a component tree

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:46,769
stuff and on the right-hand side we have

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,650
sorry zoom in the font is up to get

00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:53,000
better

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:54,860
okay right so on the right-hand side

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,290
info panel we have all these useful

00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:01,310
information such as properties change

00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:04,760
detection and put outputs the dependency

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:08,750
children for output if your component

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,310
has an event mission you can manually

00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,209
trigger it by using this handy button

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,579
here and the state tracks the component

00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:21,350
state dynamically which means if i

00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:24,590
change something here it will show up

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:27,199
there alternatively can also edit the

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,449
state of the component directly on the

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:35,419
info panel so let's I want to make this

00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:37,760
bigger tada so when I was working with

00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:38,840
angular 2 there's one thing I found a

00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,510
little bit hard to wrap my head around

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,820
with it was the dependency hierarchy

00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,979
even after I understood how it work it's

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,930
really hard to keep track of what is

00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:49,970
injecting what is initializing what what

00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,190
is depending on what so if you're

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,699
anything like me you will find this a

00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:58,960
lifesaver this is the injector graph the

00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,960
component hierarchy here

00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:08,449
the component hierarchy here shows where

00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:10,639
the components coming from and the

00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:13,039
injector graph illustrates the

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,430
relationship between the component the

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,139
injector and injectables there's another

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:21,680
visual feature that auger provides is

00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:23,090
this router tree here it shows you all

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,279
the routes that you have in your

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:27,110
application now the demo is a very

00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,539
simple app so there aren't that many

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,449
routes but once you get to the more

00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:34,729
complex apps with a lot of routes this

00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:38,930
will be really helpful save you a lot of

00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:40,969
time and brain juice so oh there's one

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,610
last thing I wanted to show you in this

00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:46,129
demo so let's say this custom component

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,419
is in behaving as expected and you want

00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:52,009
to see what the hell's going on the

00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:54,229
source code there's this handy view

00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:56,089
source button here that will take you

00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:58,069
directly to the typescript source code

00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,870
so you don't have to dig through like

00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:04,370
web hag and drill down to source and all

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:07,279
that anymore so that would it my

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,770
presentation go okay so that about sums

00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,779
up the demo there are however a lot of

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,330
features I couldn't get into details and

00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:16,580
this demo but we do have a workshop

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,949
tomorrow at 1pm it will be led by myself

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,449
and my colleague submit we will walk

00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,129
through all the features of augury with

00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:23,689
live examples and we'll be there to

00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:27,770
answer any questions if you shall have

00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:30,770
them so a little bit about augury as a

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,169
software so augury is obviously a Chrome

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,300
extension but under the extension rapper

00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:37,460
author is really just an angular 2

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,250
application written in typescript we're

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,699
using the Chrome extension API we also

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,830
rely heavily on the angular to debug API

00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:49,789
so here we have to give special thanks

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:54,919
to Tobias Igor and meshkov sorry papa

00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:57,229
misko and the rest of the angular core

00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,089
team of course for tailoring this

00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:02,089
debugging pij needs and helping us

00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:03,889
tremendously along the way if you want

00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:06,439
ever interested in knowing more about

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:09,110
the architecture of augury we have a

00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:12,939
more detailed documentation on our repo

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,939
on github so feel free to check that up

00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,919
okay so I think everyone's seen where we

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,540
stand at the moment so let's talk a

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,030
little bit about our roadmap and where

00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,680
we want to be in the immediate term well

00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,840
first of all we have to make it work

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,770
with release candidates and thanks papa

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,960
Mishka for that was lovely but

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,360
essentially it's quite simple so we're

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,949
in beta and we have to hunt down some

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,169
bug's make the two a little bit more

00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:46,030
stable and we want to improve

00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:48,340
performance of Audrey it works quite

00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:50,680
well with small apps medium even large

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,990
ops but nevertheless we can improve on

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,540
the very very large scale of the

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,400
application now after that what we're

00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:01,030
thinking off is to be able to provide

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,010
some kind of view or visual aid in order

00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,510
for everyone to be able to inspect and

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,100
measure the performance of your

00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:09,010
application so we can build faster

00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,360
applications with that and as usual we a

00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,729
triangle are focused on usability

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,260
testing and feedback from that as well

00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:17,110
as the feedback from the community which

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,120
will be incorporating as we go as per

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,889
usual as well so I guess it's worth

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,810
mentioning the team behind this so

00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:25,060
you've met me in Vanessa but you also

00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,010
have submit who will be doing the

00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,930
workshop with Vanessa tomorrow and we'll

00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,970
be going over the features in a lot more

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,729
depth and even showing more features

00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:36,370
with Bertrand who is our man of ideas

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:38,289
and at the bottom we have some of our

00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,300
designers which worked on different

00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:42,580
iterations of Audrey throughout

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,410
different times and helped us you know

00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:48,010
improve on our design and usability of

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,990
the tool having said that we are open

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,870
source and it's really important for us

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,490
that we gather more contributions for

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,890
the community this is a tool that we're

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,779
building for everyone to use and I just

00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:01,930
wanted to thank some of the existing

00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:04,570
contributors that contributed to the

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,490
stool some pors and again community

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:10,810
involvement is our first priority so

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,970
let's look deeply into our documentation

00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,680
so there is a few sources of where you
