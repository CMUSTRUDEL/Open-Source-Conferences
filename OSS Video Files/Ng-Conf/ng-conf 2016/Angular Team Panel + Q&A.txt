	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,890
me okay sound all right little louder I

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:13,889
really like to hear myself talk there it

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:17,880
is okay well thanks for coming no just

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:20,939
kidding okay we are going to wrap this

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,250
up with a panel but first point let you

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,590
guys know the funny little intros we did

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,390
we're actually written by each of the

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,070
speakers got assigned one of the other

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:35,340
speakers and they got to write their own

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:37,500
intros so we had fun with that so who

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,260
doesn't love the angular team stand up

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,260
if you don't love the angular team

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,830
nobody they all love you see I told you

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:58,320
Igor alright so that's organizers we

00:00:49,830 --> 00:01:04,220
were yeah says the guy in a comfortable

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:06,510
chair while I stand here it's not good

00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,700
all right so we wanted to do something

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,729
nice for the angular team because these

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,580
guys work guys and gals work tirelessly

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,610
to make amazing tools for all of us

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,640
right so we racket our brains thinking

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,560
what can we get them what we do for them

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,470
and we came to the conclusion that the

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,009
best gifts are the ones that are

00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:30,960
expensive and if you don't have money

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,229
after that the next best is the

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,200
sentimental kind so is it sleep huh

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,610
sleep sleep do you have one you could

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,700
have plenty of that this week get Brad

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:46,050
promise alright so what we what we did

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,390
is we made something for him and the

00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,659
story behind this when I was a kid when

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,820
I was about eight years old my dad is a

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,040
Potter right so he he taught me how to

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,590
make these little augury nose out of

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,950
clay and we're pretty poor you know

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,650
growing up and in seventh grade I wanted

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:07,470
a trampoline so bad and we just couldn't

00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,899
afford it so I practice and practice and

00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,970
practice I made hundreds of these silly

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,070
little whistles until I got like really

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,900
good at it and I took him to school and

00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,870
i sold my friends at school and i bought

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,260
a trampoline and it's been the kind of

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,900
an obsession ever since then so I want

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,970
to kind of show you how that's done so

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,500
this is what we made for the angular

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,739
team these are ceramic ocarina is first

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,880
you make them they're all made by hand

00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:40,140
you make them out of clay let them dry

00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,730
put them in the kiln this is the kiln in

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,209
my basement luckily I didn't burn down

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:49,670
my house while doing this after their

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:52,530
bisque they look like that and then you

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:56,760
glaze them and there's some

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,500
there's a close-up of the glaze then you

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,690
put them back in the kiln careful not to

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,030
get be touching any of the kiln shelves

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,650
otherwise the glaze actually melts

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,440
during the process and will run

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:11,090
everywhere if you're not careful fire

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:15,180
the kiln to 2200 degrees Fahrenheit

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:19,230
takes about 12 hours and when you're

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:22,350
done they look like that and there's a

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,730
close-up so we made one of these for

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,500
each the team and a little book that

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,820
shows them how to play it your kids are

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,130
mostly going to love this so if you have

00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,780
kids or if you're like Igor you're gonna

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,390
love it so I had to give one for Igor

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,910
and one for each of his kids cuz I know

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,920
I knew he wouldn't be sharing it so

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,540
sunny why don't you come and give those

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,540
each to them and

00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:53,910
so I expect a little concert I expect

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,590
you to be good by the next ng-conf while

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,030
they're passing that out those out all I

00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,090
government I'll show you what it sounds

00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,090
like

00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Oh

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,710
Oh

00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,259
love you guys

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:54,240
beautiful and Igor the ones for your

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:57,600
kids are actually perfectly tuned so

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,070
they can annoy you a ton now they're in

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,950
the same exact key so you can play

00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:04,260
little duets and stuff don't like it all

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,730
right let's end this with a panel so

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:09,240
we've taken some questions from Twitter

00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,650
and we've got some mics so if you have a

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,280
question in the room and you were too

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,390
lazy to tweet it go talk to Aaron and

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,390
we'll we'll just kind of go back and

00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:22,380
forth and are no Brad you want to kind

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:27,200
of decide who takes what okay first

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,200
question when is angular 2 coming out I

00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,750
think you know that right after that

00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,790
template compile it gets done so that'll

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,220
be your key you'll know the template

00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:42,000
compiler yeah all right so when those

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,470
stars align well no will play we're

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,290
going to go back and we're gonna work on

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:50,940
that thing sweet I hope you take the

00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:52,410
weekend off at least first all right sim

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,450
but in the room yet know if you have

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:58,380
questions come talk to frosty and just

00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:01,200
will form a line okay where do you see

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,150
the progression of pwas going with

00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,510
angular will become less important in

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,670
the future to build native mobile apps

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,580
that's the hope is that the web platform

00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:13,920
continues to catch up in ways that

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,930
native leads right now in terms of our

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,550
own support for pw a's we're focusing on

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,140
the three areas of app shell

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,710
architecture building tooling for that

00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,880
service workers doing good tooling and

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,980
strategies for that and then install the

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,540
apps in the future I think we'll

00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,330
continue to focus on the performance

00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,070
critical areas like looking at service

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,830
worker in HP to and what kind of

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:37,080
strategies we can employ to have

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,600
efficient updating of applications and

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,130
pre caching and things like that and

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,140
also continuing to focus like working

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,390
with Patrick and Jeff on universal to

00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,940
have a full end-to-end pre-rendering

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:52,690
and/or pretty building and taking over

00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:54,460
on the browser side and then web workers

00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,800
is another big performance or that we've

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,980
been focusing on so beyond that probably

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,660
probably focusing more on data model off

00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,570
lining words right now we're focusing a

00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:10,210
lot on just static asset offline awesome

00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:14,440
okay next question when is angular 2

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:16,360
coming out just kidding all right what

00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:26,070
is the future of dollar sign Q and

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:29,650
promises in angular 2 it's is Rob here

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:31,180
Sosa dollar sign Q Q's the promise

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,430
implementation angular 1 for those that

00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,660
don't know in angular 2 we actually

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,120
don't need a custom from its

00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,980
implementation because by now all of the

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,440
African browser is already implemented a

00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,570
promising a pharmacist natively so you

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,310
can just use those and the reason why

00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,470
you don't need to do anything special is

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,800
because zones know how to integrate the

00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,270
native promises with angular um Rob

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,690
could probably talk about observables

00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:59,560
and how we think about promises in the

00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:01,870
future of promises I think that we'll

00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,250
we'll keep supporting promises because

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,500
there are cases where the make sense but

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,180
I think that we will we will push very

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,070
hard for observables as well I think

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,710
that them together is very very nice

00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,810
pattern observables but yeah like I

00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,840
think that

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,950
right so we had a special right like now

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,510
we're just going to use what the

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,650
language gives us going forward and

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,919
hopefully we'll have observables in the

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,919
language

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,330
alright awkward silence after that

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:39,840
answer is the offline compilation

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:41,610
already available in RC 1 yes we do have

00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,140
something published right now it's not

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,340
quite ready to use there's a couple big

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,040
bucks who didn't get out before the

00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:49,470
conference RC 2 will probably be the

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,650
first chance to give it a try for real I

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:55,590
suspect there will be a few more cycles

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,630
of finding and fixing his juice I was

00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:00,200
working with the ionic guys yesterday to

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,980
see how how their extensions to the

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,870
component annotation are going to work

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,980
we have other partners to work with to

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,690
make sure that they can hook things up

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,360
and then obviously we need to do things

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,220
with built dueling so that you can you

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,770
can mix and match from you know for

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,150
example using webpack right now our demo

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,490
was just using roll up but we want to

00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,660
also make it work with closure compiler

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:23,840
and we also need to write documentation

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:28,820
so that so that you know what to do cool

00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,820
how does lazy loading work with bundling

00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:36,070
so most of the butler's have a concept

00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:40,310
of splitting bundles into multiple

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:43,010
chunks if you take for example um d-md

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:47,690
bundles can be composed so that was just

00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:49,520
fine webpack come has a notion of splits

00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,080
and coats plates and can understand how

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,300
to load different chunks and combine

00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,520
them together system builder does the

00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,209
same thing so all of these bundlers that

00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,670
we use today have some notion of

00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:03,110
combining multiple chunks so it's just a

00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,440
matter of loading the chunks at the

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,240
right time and then continuing the

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,800
application from the time and what's

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,930
with the code arise to the browser can

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,209
okay is in G helping influence browsers

00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:22,490
to bacon more native binding of objects

00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:23,899
saddam or other related items what are

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,080
you guys making doing to make the web

00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:29,120
better basically know are you guys

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,120
working to put pushing for more native

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,750
bindings of objects to the dom or other

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,700
related out like a zombie sure

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,280
oh it subjects little thing of the

00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,100
future I think I think object observe

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,560
has been taken out of tc39 so it's no

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:49,160
longer a part of the thing it turns out

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:51,680
that when you do data binding the order

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,480
of things matters and you want to make

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,030
sure that you go from the roots to the

00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,030
children so if you have a predictable

00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:01,340
data flow and the object observe API

00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:03,650
didn't have a concept of this kind of a

00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,780
direction so that was kind of its its

00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,050
flaw that was not exactly obvious at the

00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,050
very beginning

00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,590
and on the subject of like the web api

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,090
is in general i think that what we hope

00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,590
is that things like service workers and

00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,090
web push and background sync and all

00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,760
these things like we want to make it

00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:25,170
easy to use these things and increase

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,790
adoption that way and i think that if we

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,440
can make it easy to use those kind of

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,350
api's they can be complicated sometimes

00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,670
then other browsers pick it up right

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,710
like we we want to make sure that it's

00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,300
easy use these these api is that exists

00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:43,800
and keep pushing more aps into the

00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:48,120
platform sure they like that one all

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,890
right so i can see benefits to angular 2

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,870
as a developer but you have any advice

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,850
for convincing management to move to

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:57,450
angular 2 i actually have one you get a

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:59,220
pinata and you practice your speech no

00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:06,510
this is right for you Brad any advice

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:10,140
for convincing managers Jules any advice

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:12,180
for convincing managers my mind let me

00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,900
start off and then you can correct me

00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,070
arrival screwed it up so I think

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,230
managers want to see that somebody else

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,760
has already been successful with

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,200
implementing this thing so you know I

00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,260
don't want to be the first out there on

00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,660
something that's marked as beta and we

00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,190
you know early on we didn't have much of

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,050
in terms of deployment but now we have

00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,540
this awesome set of people who are

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,640
already implementing deploying and for

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,830
Google like big one is Adwords and it's

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,820
the biggest moneymaker google has so

00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,580
it's probably the biggest money maker

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,100
app on the planet already deploying on

00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,960
angular 2 and at this conference we

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,170
heard of the keynote from The Weather

00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:51,720
Channel and capital one and lucid chart

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:54,450
and and all of these folks you know

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,670
fidelity was up on the slides so you can

00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:59,520
now actually point at a whole bunch of

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,320
big folks who are working on this

00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,630
working with us to ensure all of those

00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,760
use cases work and so really the risk is

00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,610
low and you know mishegoss always hey

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:12,090
are moved from beta to release two final

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,350
is words and you know we a lot of these

00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,970
things are beaten down we're being

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,260
really open with you guys about what's

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,300
not there it's you know template

00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,590
compiler and maybe there's your favorite

00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,530
thing that's not there and that's how I

00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:24,920
would go about it is to say there are

00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:26,779
big companies betting there

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,820
livelihoods on this and so obviously

00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:30,260
there a lot of these cases are done and

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,300
so what we should do as a company is

00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,190
look at it from the use cases that we

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,500
need to see if it's there for us the

00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,000
only thing I'd add to that is that at

00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,620
least the managers that have approached

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,120
me directly for this conversation and

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,220
that's actually what I usually say is

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,990
they also want to know that there's the

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,540
resources necessary to get their teams

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:51,170
over to angular 2 so that's why we made

00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,940
such a big push before of RC to make

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,320
sure that there was already angular 2

00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,760
training that we had worked with those

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,589
trainers to make sure that it's how we

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,470
recommend you approach not only the

00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:01,970
upgrade but using angular 2 and then the

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,860
other thing that I was getting asked a

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,600
lot and Brad sort of mentioned this in

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,820
the interview if you saw it yesterday is

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,070
that it's not an either/or we were

00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,630
getting a lot of oh my managers telling

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,149
us we have to make a decision between

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,339
react and angular or ember and angular

00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:18,649
or whatever the framework that they were

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,510
looking at is and I think as the team

00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:23,120
has hopefully communicated this week is

00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,649
we work with all those teams and so it's

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,750
not an either/or decision and that

00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:31,339
should make managers a little bit easier

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:33,740
to convince yeah and they can come talk

00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:35,829
to our developer advocate folks over

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,940
here Robin Steven who are there to help

00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:41,240
reason with it and figure out what does

00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:43,550
it fit my needs so from your your

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,500
perspective would you say that angular 2

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:49,010
release candidate is production ready

00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,990
today for many of our big clients yes

00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:52,760
and like with then you know look we

00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,779
don't know all the use cases so maybe

00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,699
there's something doesn't work for you

00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:57,589
you kind of have to own that part but

00:14:55,699 --> 00:15:00,430
yeah there's a ton of big folks using it

00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:00,430
awesome

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:12,650
that was a yes okay well on that same

00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:14,900
topic what things is angular 2 done to

00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:18,290
make migrating from angular 1 to angular

00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:22,250
2 easier than migrating to say ember or

00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:24,770
reactor some other option so we have

00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,300
this thing called ng upgrade that allows

00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,100
you to mix and match angular 1 and

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,440
angular 2 components there are some

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,480
restrictions it's not magical right but

00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,550
does mean that you can take an angular 1

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,310
app I mean and decide that a particular

00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,630
service gets converted to angular 2 so

00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:42,470
we have Bridget engine bridge the

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:44,180
injectors we have also made sure that

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,530
you can bootstrap an angular 1

00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,730
components out of angular 2 and vice

00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,010
versa angular 2 components out of

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,900
regular one the injectors are bridge so

00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,370
you can inject different things and so

00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:56,180
what you can do is you can start with a

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:57,830
nap and convert individual components or

00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,810
services one at a time while the

00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,850
application is still functioning there's

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,640
a good demo on the angular i/o on how

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,750
this can be done and to give it a try so

00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,430
I think the energy upgrade should go a

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,430
long way towards this goal

00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:15,320
we should also mention all the work that

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,209
has been done in angular 1 were many

00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,420
features that we came up with an angular

00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:22,579
2 were backported back to England thanks

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,279
to pete and her heroes and Martin many

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:27,170
other people so if you are working with

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,339
angle 1 applications today you actually

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,180
can start using many of the features

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:33,290
that are were introduced in angular 2

00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,200
and you can use them in a glove one

00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,540
today so that that's going to make it

00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,459
easier for you to start using angular 2

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,980
once you're ready for it and I think

00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:44,660
like on a philosophical level max lin

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,980
chu who works for ionic but a really

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,589
really good blog post you should read

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,420
and it's called something like angular 2

00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:52,970
or angular as a design pattern and I

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,110
feel like for all the talk of syntax

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,060
changes everything like that if you're

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,680
an angular 1 developer you pretty much

00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,120
already know how to use angular to write

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,769
like it's something that that the the

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,680
ideas are the same the philosophy is the

00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:05,000
same and it's really just like when you

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,380
get an angular 2 you'll be very very

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,780
comfortable so if you've got a dev team

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,549
full of angular 1 dads they'll migrate

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,079
their brains to angular 2 very very very

00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:17,569
easily I think that's an important thing

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:19,730
to say so like Jill said we have

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,220
invested a lot in training on our site

00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,799
there's a very nice cookbook article put

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,500
together by tero that walks you through

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,210
how you migrate an app from angular 1

00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,429
tengo tu and many of our training

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,960
partners like wrangle and thought RAM

00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:35,120
and others have actually built guides

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,130
and can like in class walk you through

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,360
this porting process so we really want

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,980
to support it from you know the

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,140
infrastructure to our docs to our

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,610
training partners we think we're we're

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,720
going to do a good job you guys should

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,880
tell us what else you need to be

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,110
successful because we want this whole

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,919
community to come over to angular 2

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:53,750
because it's awesome very cool ok let's

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,500
take one from the audience here quit and

00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:59,480
say your name and question this is zak

00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,150
well hey this is zach just talked about

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,630
performance one of the questions I had

00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:08,210
now that we have HTTP two coming out do

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:12,500
you see bundling dying and what else can

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:14,700
we do to further cash as much as we can

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,460
of the application

00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:20,490
it'd be where Jeff actually maybe Jeff's

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,710
been looking at this the most yeah our

00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,420
hope is or our dream is that one day a

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,630
bungling could go away everything can be

00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,890
loaded individually and like the you

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,830
would actually loading the parts of

00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,330
angular that you need at runtime right

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,580
now it's not quite there browsers are

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,290
really focusing on this though firefox

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,090
chrome we talked to regularly we do some

00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,920
of our own measurement of what the cost

00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,080
is of doing it this way and we share

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,120
that with them so browsers are working

00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,250
on making that reality making sure it

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,020
can be as fast or faster than within

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,850
bundle strategies and we're also

00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,590
starting to think about how we can make

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:56,580
serviceworker play well with HP too

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:58,080
particularly with HP to push making it

00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,650
efficient only pushing things that are

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,900
already cached and a few other things

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,340
with that as well so yeah we're hopeful

00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,140
hopeful hopefully we see a lot of

00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,140
progress in that in the next year or two

00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,310
still one more here hello my name is

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,350
andreas i'm a bit concerned about the

00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:22,830
world of languages that we got now with

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:26,700
annular to that we learn type spit okay

00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:28,830
that's quite ya might like it but i had

00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,230
bad experiences with CoffeeScript before

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:36,090
I had lots of effort to get that out of

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:38,610
my code base so yeah really and I have

00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:41,190
to that's that's a real concern for our

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:44,640
developers what we shall use the next

00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,950
language again so what is your opinion

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:51,240
on the development of the language

00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:54,510
JavaScript itself will that merge in the

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,270
future will that be add one of the

00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:01,740
languages that compile down to stuff

00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:03,540
like as in a sm j s or yeah where are

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,870
you going are you working on getting

00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:09,810
typescript into the standard process of

00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:12,360
javascript or will the Chrome browser at

00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:15,120
any point in time maybe except native

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,580
typescript for instance as

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,860
fire salsify without compiling there's

00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:25,700
probably a question for each of you in

00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:28,770
there Oh civics I know the question

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,380
sorry so I think that like my first

00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,790
answer that would be I would strongly

00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,440
recommend if you're going to use any

00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,640
others using typescript like that that's

00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,440
my that's my right that's my first

00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,270
answer right but I think that the the

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,890
nice thing about typescript and you

00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,840
mentioned coffeescript right and i think

00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,100
that there's a very large difference to

00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,440
be mentioned between coffee inscription

00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,910
typescript and that is like if you if

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,710
you forget about the types and

00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,390
typescript then it's it's JavaScript

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,710
right like that's the big thing about

00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,300
typescript I think for us is that you

00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,170
get the benefits but if you decide one

00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,360
day that you know long going to use

00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,010
typescript right it's one transpiler

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,540
step and then you've got a pure e 06

00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,120
codebase right and I think that that's a

00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,280
big thing maybe somebody else to talk

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,780
about like the language as a standard is

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,490
probably not my discussion but I think

00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,140
from a dev of you like it's so

00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,730
productive and so awesome and there's

00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,470
very little risk for me and using an

00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,820
using typescript and six months ago I

00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,950
would have said that right and I think

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,050
that it's they've made huge strides to

00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,700
be a six ready and working with us that

00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:26,700
I think it's it's the best choice for

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:28,770
the forebrain go to for sure so one way

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,250
to think about typescript is it is it is

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:34,020
it's an exact superset of es6 or yes

00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:37,080
whatever because they're tracking the

00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,220
standard if you ever don't like it you

00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,570
can look at the output you notice it

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,890
looks like what you had written by hand

00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,660
with just the type stripped out and so

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:45,150
you could always just run it through the

00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,590
compiler past es6 and just check that in

00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:50,220
and move along as if nothing had

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,780
happened as far as standards go like we

00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,630
think about this we talked to andrews

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:57,330
and the team a bunch about it it's a

00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,770
little unclear to us what the browsers

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,540
would do if it was in it you kind of

00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,740
don't want it there because it's big so

00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,940
you would probably strip it out for

00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:06,090
production anyway you might want it

00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,679
there as a developer but there's nothing

00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:09,960
it would only be for kind of if I don't

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,030
like a little nicer than source maps is

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,070
what you would get out of it we we

00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:17,220
actually the chrome team did a really

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:19,890
in-depth experiment to see could types

00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,470
and even strong types in fluent in the

00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,150
browser be helpful and kind of the the

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,500
answer that came back was no

00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:29,470
and we talked about this of the TC the

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,420
last tc39 meeting that I was in and so

00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,520
like it was kind of a revelation like

00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,830
there's just too many roadblocks to get

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,660
value out of it in terms of like maybe

00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,420
performance optimization or other

00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,820
interesting things like that so that I

00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,370
think there might be value in it being a

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,170
standard but maybe not part of tc39

00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:51,990
maybe being another standard that's just

00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,990
personal opinion on top of other stuff

00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,260
alright the next one is what keeps all

00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:02,049
of you guys working at Google when there

00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,640
are so many other opportunities you

00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:06,150
probably have a lot of recruiters I

00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,470
wouldn't want to see your LinkedIn inbox

00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:14,679
Naomi do you want to talk about why

00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:17,529
you're here really come on honey yes

00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,270
it's on okay I have the worst commute it

00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,770
takes if you go at rush hour it takes

00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:23,350
two and a half hours to get to google

00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:26,320
and I've I've been at Google for nine

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:28,090
years now almost ten and I I kept

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,799
thinking well I'll probably this will be

00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,559
good and I'll leave but what keeps me

00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:36,039
there is I get to work on problems at

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:38,409
Google that are on a scale that blows my

00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:41,020
mind when you look at what we're doing

00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:42,520
on angular we have the potential to

00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,710
really change how front-end web

00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,010
development is done for the world and

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,570
being able to work on that is such a joy

00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,620
and a privilege that even when it gets

00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:55,240
hard it's worth that crazy commute and

00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,529
working with these people working with

00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,350
all of you in the open source community

00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:01,830
and having that be my job that gets me

00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,830
up in the morning

00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,940
we're not going to do better than that

00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,950
let's go next question all right and

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,320
then what is your number one biggest

00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,919
regret having after having worked on

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,570
angular 2 for the last couple years Oh

00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:23,970
myshko you got mad Misha goes your

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,370
biggest regret is that I pretty sure to

00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,019
ask Mishka what his biggest regret it Oh

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:31,529
his biggest regret is working with me

00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:36,000
probably but good recovery any regrets

00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:38,460
anyone we're all very positive people I

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,019
know we're trying to break that show and

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:47,370
get to the good stuff okay if you think

00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:49,559
of one all right does redux does the

00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:55,100
Redux / reducer architecture have a

00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:57,600
place with angular 2 yes yes it does

00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,710
yeah I think but it does we're just

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,389
having a conversation on the hall with

00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:02,850
the Wrangell folks about they have redux

00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:05,700
and I not just me but the people who

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,250
contribute to ng RX yes and I think that

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,350
like in a larger sense that not just

00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,880
redux but there's a lot of things that

00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,230
all these JavaScript communities can

00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,789
learn for each other like there's a lot

00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:17,460
of react versus angular and I think that

00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:19,230
like redux and some of the stuff that

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,450
comes out of the rack land is incredibly

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:23,429
interesting stuff that we as angular

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,919
developer should all take a look at we

00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:27,409
should all learn from that and yeah so

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,900
yes it's the short answer that question

00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:32,910
yes is the long answer of that question

00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,740
I think they're doing a lot with with

00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:38,490
that very thing at Netflix aren't they

00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,860
yes okay of all the improvements in

00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:50,910
angular 2 what's your favorite what are

00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:53,130
you most proud of observables i like how

00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:57,960
global it is and the speed of

00:25:53,130 --> 00:26:00,510
improvements being made nobody else is

00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,310
proud not really I like the overall

00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,830
architecture and how it all hangs

00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,240
together like we've tackled more

00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,830
problems than we've ever tapped before

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,510
so the fact that we can do a universal

00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,630
that works with web workers that works

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:15,570
with animations that's all super fast

00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:18,660
I'm really proud of that I would chime

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:20,880
in and say the static analyze ability of

00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:23,250
the framework is really i think the

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,650
hugest thing that is different about

00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,420
angular 1 that lets you do incredible

00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,310
optimizations and developer experience

00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:33,600
improvements that were impossible before

00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:35,760
i really like that we were able to get a

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,650
read of lot of stuff like the dalek you

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,540
that we mentioned before like in angular

00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,520
1 we had to make up many of these things

00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,140
are written ban the wheel and a glue to

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,990
we don't need to do that anymore and I

00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,280
think that's really cool I was going to

00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,210
add that it's finally a framework I

00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,210
don't have to be embarrassed about

00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:57,540
can I like the other thing I would say

00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,650
is that you said this to me in the

00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,300
office the other day we were like

00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,470
polishing up the last couple steps of

00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,360
something and you looked at me and you

00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,220
said something like this is so cool

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,900
because nobody else is doing this right

00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,490
like nobody else is in the position that

00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,930
we're in right now and i think that the

00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,880
next two years of angular are going to

00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,440
be just ridiculously exciting because we

00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,030
built a really cool platform and the

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,410
kind of stuff that people going to build

00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:19,890
on top it's going to be pretty rad i

00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:21,150
think so go do that all of you edem it

00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,230
seems kind of prosaic to say this

00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,390
because this is an obvious thing

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,830
everything needs but I'm really really

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,020
proud of what words been able to achieve

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,760
on the docks bringing a team of people

00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,860
together and delivering dots that are

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,179
really addressing your needs in a way

00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,559
that I think on angular 1 we weren't

00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:36,750
able to do I think we've come a long way

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,480
and I'm really excited to see we have a

00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,890
lot still to do but I'm really really

00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,000
proud of how far the docs have come on

00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:47,540
angular 2 for me I think that it's yeah

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,540
absolutely

00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,960
yeah I find the core abstractions of

00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,580
angular 2 are just much simpler than

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,500
that was an angular 1 like looking at

00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,900
templates I can see you know what is

00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,880
data binding go property what the events

00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,220
are the structural directives are much

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,260
clearer I find it's much easier to

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:14,280
understand the concepts of angular 2 vs

00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:17,010
angular 1 so actually very well the next

00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,990
question which is are you guys worried

00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:21,510
at all that angular 2 will be harder to

00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,670
learn for a new developer than angular 1

00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:28,890
with new concepts like observables

00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:30,600
decorators type script etc so as I said

00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,860
I was only half joking about not being

00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,600
embarrassed about the first framework

00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,000
there are certain things that you will

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,890
have to unlearn like the dollar scoop

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,890
dollar apply and all those things that

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:48,000
so i think it is simpler but if you if

00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,680
you brand new I've never seen angular

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,630
before I think learning angular 2 is

00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,550
relatively straightforward if you're

00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,830
coming from angular 1 you might have to

00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:59,340
like relearn couple of things and

00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:00,750
unlearn a few things so i would add you

00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,940
know when i joined the team i hadn't

00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,350
worked with angular before so i went

00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,820
down the path of like oh I need to learn

00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,800
this and I need to learn it in a weekend

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,270
and I started taking angular 1 courses

00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,520
and I came in on a Monday and Brad said

00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,960
you know if you just learned angular 2

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,910
there's like fifty seven things you

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,350
don't have to know anymore and I was

00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,850
like forget this annular one thing I'm

00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:20,010
just gonna go forward with angular 2

00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,050
because it was so much easier and if i

00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:24,240
look at angular 1 code now I'm able to

00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:26,190
understand it but there's just so much

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,170
stuff in there and I think not having to

00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:31,130
learn all that stuff is is really

00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:33,120
awesome and it's going to be way easier

00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,410
but the other thing is that a lot of

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,210
people talk to me and I think that

00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:38,460
angular is a framework is far simpler I

00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:40,560
think that honestly the hardest thing

00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,390
will be the rest of being a JavaScript

00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,500
developer right tooling and packaging

00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:45,780
and bundling and all that other stuff

00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,980
and a lot of people upset that to me and

00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,470
I think probably you as well but like

00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,790
we're super confident the framework is

00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:53,760
better and stronger and easier to learn

00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:55,110
but I think we also are now very aware

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,820
even more so than we were that like

00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:59,100
tooling is a thing that we need to

00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,480
handle and we we want to handle for you

00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,490
where we can write so I think that

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,110
that's will try to take that next step

00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,090
for you I think of making that easier to

00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,139
deal with

00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:10,179
one thing I that is that I think there's

00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,620
a lot of things that you should be doing

00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:13,179
if you're building any sort of

00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,789
JavaScript application now right

00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:17,649
progressive web applications server-side

00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:19,600
rendering for the first run of the

00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,429
application and those things were really

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,870
hard in that you or one and their heart

00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:23,919
a little bit in any or two but we're

00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,179
trying to make it easier and we're

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:32,919
building the tooling that makes that

00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:39,779
easy okay so you are all superheroes to

00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:39,779
this community who are your heroes Brad

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,390
maybe when you're a hero you don't need

00:30:45,700 --> 00:31:00,909
a hero Victor South Caen he couldn't be

00:30:49,390 --> 00:31:03,159
here but he's my hero Tara position my

00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:04,720
hand winch I'm cuzzo this is a little

00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:07,120
bit pandering but some of you actually

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,890
douve in to angular 2 way before it was

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,500
ready and you give us a lot of feedback

00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:13,179
so thank you I don't know if that's hero

00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,860
worship but you guys did dangerous

00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:19,059
things that were not sure it was going

00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:21,279
to pan out well and I guess I would say

00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:23,590
like from the cos I'm the observable guy

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,840
right like matt potter sake for our X

00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:28,539
and Ben Lesh for like redoing our X for

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,370
us they've been huge partners for us and

00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:32,380
that's awesome and I think like on a

00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,929
personal note dan abramov he does Redux

00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,279
right like he's a big big big person for

00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:40,179
me right now I've learned a huge amount

00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:42,460
from those guys so I want to add to be

00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:44,080
us who's not here with us at ng-conf has

00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,080
been doing a lot of great work over the

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,730
past few months yeah that the offline

00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,380
compiler is mostly based on his work to

00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:53,140
take the online compiler and make it

00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:55,630
powered by static reflection so plus 12

00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:58,919
Tobias I'm hoping we can name it the toe

00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,919
Beiler because it's so awesome

00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:05,090
hassle you first I was gonna add tell a

00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,830
little story about to be as that you

00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,660
know every time he comes to office he's

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,340
like I have an idea Mishka it's like

00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,410
what's your idea I'm gonna rewrite the

00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,179
compiler and I'm like okay and he always

00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,799
reef actors the thing it's like twice as

00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:17,900
faster than it was before it's like how

00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:22,030
do you do that over and over again like

00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:26,150
at some point you gotta hit a limit I

00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:28,190
would say frosty and Dave and Joe Eames

00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:29,510
and sunny and everybody else who's

00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:33,130
involved with organizing this conference

00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:33,130
whoo wouldn't be able

00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,280
thank you you all everybody who was

00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,980
involved in organizing this made this

00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:49,980
happen three years ago from nothing and

00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:52,170
made angular conference thing happened

00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,770
and it's wonderful that all of these

00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:58,110
people can be here and be a part of this

00:32:54,770 --> 00:33:01,860
thank you I just I stopped listening

00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:07,200
fast Dave so whatever else you said I

00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:10,980
agree with it okay what do you guys love

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,860
best about the angular community and

00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:20,370
maybe what would you like to see changed

00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:22,170
to end on a negative note you know the

00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,700
places i like the angular community best

00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,320
is where I see collaboration where

00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,120
people come together to build things I

00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,980
don't you know we we get involved in

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,420
some of the places like the docks like

00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,680
some of our favorite people have written

00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,850
docks and cookbooks and things for us

00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:37,860
and then universal and the CLI I would

00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:40,290
love to see more of that I would just

00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:43,020
love to see folks organized into groups

00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:45,120
where you see a problem find a way to be

00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:51,690
a leader and bring other people with you

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:53,430
along so like I got started on an

00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,830
angular on IRC back in the day I'm like

00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:57,720
hash angularjs yeah and that's what I

00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:59,040
learned angular and just being in that

00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,690
community and helping people and then

00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,340
the same things happened on Gator with

00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,080
England to right there are thousands of

00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,850
people in that room every day helping

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,020
people answering questions everybody's

00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,310
kind of learning together and I think

00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,260
that's the best thing about the England

00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:11,520
community is that you those like what 20

00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,470
of us and we can't teach you everything

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,180
but then we have this like force

00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,470
multiplier this awesome community who

00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:19,520
teaches everybody and it's it's

00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:19,520
brilliant so keep doing that

00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,419
okay we'll take one for the audience in

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,429
this we have any notes that wanted to

00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:34,040
answer that last one okay i am no rash

00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:35,780
and i was really surprised that no

00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,710
questions have come up for material yet

00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:43,629
and it's so awesome that angular is

00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:46,609
beautiful but giving a very high quality

00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:49,040
front end library is equally important

00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:50,899
so I really want to thank the material

00:34:49,040 --> 00:35:01,400
team right there for doing such a great

00:34:50,899 --> 00:35:06,530
job with coming up with the beta okay

00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:09,050
one more right here Oh awesome hi well

00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:11,000
first off thank you and secondly i had a

00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:13,160
practical question when it came to ngf

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,609
grade which still kind of blows my mind

00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,950
but if we if you're working on an

00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:22,520
angular 1 application that is going to

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:24,680
stay angular 1 for about a year is it

00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,720
still but it will eventually go to is it

00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,119
worthwhile right now to be building

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,540
components through ng upgrade and

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,609
angular 2 or would be better to wait

00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:37,369
until you're closer through the

00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:39,520
transform and refactor that's a really

00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,520
good question

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,270
I'll try Robin you can go on so there's

00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,619
a if you move to angular 15 there's this

00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,750
nice option you can write your

00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:54,330
components in the style of angular 2

00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,010
without ever leaving angular 1 at the

00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,930
same time you know Pete and the rest of

00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:00,150
the team are working on bringing more of

00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,520
the api's like Igor mentioned router

00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,800
already exists but animation i 10 n

00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,390
there so you can actually take advantage

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,920
of a lot of the pieces of angular 2 you

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,960
might move to type scripting your code

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,850
base as another way that can help you

00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,490
refactor things when the time comes

00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:16,950
where the ids can do more work so you

00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,840
can actually completely exist on an

00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:21,540
angular 1 code base and still be

00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,100
preparing for angular 2 if there are

00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,680
some components that you think would

00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,910
benefit from the speed up angular 2 you

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,000
might rewrite some of the big

00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:34,130
problematic pieces and include those in

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:37,290
rob you of other things ok good awesome

00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:41,160
ok I think we will end with just one

00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:42,960
last question and you are all welcome to

00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,109
answer it or just whoever has a thought

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,900
but is what would you say or what would

00:36:46,109 --> 00:36:52,020
you hope would be the main takeaway from

00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:54,590
ng-conf and this is a chance for all of

00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,730
you to give your talks all over again so

00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,770
no what do you think should be the main

00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,310
takeaway it's ok if we have lots of

00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,310
different answers

00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:08,660
I'll try so these conversations we've

00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,220
been having this is the most magical

00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,190
thing for us I think I hope you folks

00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:15,320
have had some value out of meeting folks

00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,820
who are doing what you're doing and

00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,080
collaborating with them there are some

00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,900
awesome meetups in your neighborhood and

00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,790
if there aren't please start them go and

00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,900
be part of those meetups give talks find

00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,490
other people to give talks because

00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:32,200
that's where we can all learn from each

00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:35,000
other and become a bigger community I

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,130
was going to say that it that anglers

00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,930
kind of grown-up is not just for web now

00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:42,460
it's also a full-on platform for

00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:42,460
rendering to other things to the web

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,120
some say that like the thing they made

00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:49,250
angular 1 great was that there was this

00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,540
entire huge ecosystem of components and

00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,160
directives and all this stuff that

00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:54,140
people built like lazy loading and all

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,210
the stuff that we didn't build that's

00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,130
like I want you all to know that now you

00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,690
can start doing that like that's what

00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,460
for me like the takeaway for me is you

00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,050
should go home now and all that awesome

00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,610
stuff people of regular one like Google

00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:07,040
differ angular 2 like because it's ready

00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:12,020
to do that but I think migrated to

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,760
angular 2 yeah yes it build it I would

00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,260
like you guys all to walk away knowing

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,670
that all these guys appear build this

00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,830
product but it's not just about the

00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:21,020
technology they really build it for you

00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,880
guys and it drives them to get up every

00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,170
morning and I've seen them I've seen

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,840
them stay up all night every night

00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,610
especially for the last month or so so

00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,010
it's all about you and we want to hear

00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:32,630
from you yeah I would definitely echo

00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,250
that and say go build amazing things

00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:37,120
with angular 2 and let's make the

00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:37,120
platform better together

00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,560
it looks like we have one last question

00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:54,300
from the audience go ahead it's actually

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:59,230
for you when it's free comp 2017 Oh

00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:01,690
educomp 2017 we've just been grounded

00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:07,660
from angular team by Brad so I don't

00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:09,520
know well let you know we were going to

00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,590
call it off except for that ocarina gift

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,890
and so now we should talk so we're back

00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:19,150
in our back yeah we're back in excellent

00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:21,840
okay well that's that wraps it up give
