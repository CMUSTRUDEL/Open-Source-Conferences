in case your boss or coworkers are

00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,660
sitting next to you that would be really

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,920
operator to be even more awkward if you

00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,090
just co-founded the startup and your

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,500
co-founder was next to you come on man I

00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,820
didn't hate my job when I started in

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,350
this industry in the mid-90s if that's

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,440
even readable sorry it's a career

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,670
timeline I wrote 14 desktop apps for

00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,960
Windows including the world's first

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:40,770
automatic pop-up advertisement killer hi

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,270
thank you it was terrible I didn't know

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,240
what I was doing I didn't make a lot of

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,040
money but I was super happy after a

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,500
two-year interlude where I depending on

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,470
your point of view either taught or

00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,210
bothered people about religion I got my

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,650
first job working for somebody else in

00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:01,110
2003 and I didn't love it over the next

00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,420
seven and a half years I changed jobs

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:08,490
five more times and things only got

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:13,710
worse hi was miserable why was I so

00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:14,910
unhappy was it bad luck maybe was there

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,410
perhaps a common thread running through

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,900
those six jobs something at the root of

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,160
it all that was making me unhappy it

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,720
took me years but I eventually reached

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,720
the obvious conclusion the one that no

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,740
doubt you have already figured out and

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,090
that is that I needed to give up

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,360
internet explorer 6 as my default

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,360
browser

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,380
okay it wasn't your next 4-6 it also

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,660
wasn't a seven-year-long no doughnut

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,590
diet I would never ever agree to that

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:43,620
the real problem is that people suck

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,870
people suck so badly and are so wrong

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,430
that one job I had to keep a text file

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,170
on my computer call things I am right

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,970
about txt in order to keep track of all

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,560
the things like it rub in people's faces

00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,540
later when they realized how wrong they

00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,100
were and how right I was I once had a

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,400
super crappy employer all right this

00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,890
this employer friction jerks they wanted

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,570
to give me a raise for taking the job

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:13,500
seriously and showing up on time every

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:17,640
day in the morning I can you believe the

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,920
nerve they had crazy jerks another super

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,600
crappy jerk face of a CEO didn't trust

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,950
the development team sure we might have

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,290
been behind schedule and the company

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,600
wasn't doing that well but to refuse us

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,880
our promise bonuses I don't think so I

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,890
did the obvious thing sent an email to

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,890
my boss telling him I was quitting so I

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,850
could go to Aruba with some friends now

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:41,040
this may seem weird and unintuitive but

00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,280
sometimes rage quitting isn't the best

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,280
option

00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,410
sometimes things I am right about txt

00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:51,410
isn't quite enough sometimes you need to

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,390
tell the world I feel deep inside right

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,220
who in here be honest has ever

00:03:53,390 --> 00:04:01,640
complained to somebody about else about

00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:03,050
code you didn't write yeah me too I was

00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,370
one so frustrated this code was so bad

00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:07,400
so awful eyes had to tell somebody

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,660
anybody about this code so i opened up

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,760
my instant messenger and fired off a

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,310
frustrated complaint to a friend or so

00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,600
frustrated only to realize a few seconds

00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,090
later that I'd accidentally sent the

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,730
message to the wrong person I had in

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,130
fact sent the message to my coworker

00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:25,130
dude you suck your code is terrible I

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,420
hate you creeper friends now it was

00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,890
really awkward and terrible so I gave

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,130
him a poisoned apple and then that was

00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:33,650
into the story at the time I was super

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:36,290
frustrated with a coworker just really

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,490
annoyed me had to tell people about as I

00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,420
told everybody you've been home behind

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,650
the co-workers back and one day just

00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,870
went on for weeks and one day the

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,900
co-worker pulled me aside hello here

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,550
comes Oh found out my coworker on

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:56,000
ironically thanked me for being a nice

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:59,150
person and told me how grateful they

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,940
were that I was I always took extra time

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:06,260
to help out when it was needed I felt

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:07,880
like garbage I have always presented

00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,840
myself to the world is a nice person hey

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,070
I'm nice to me but what I was what I

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,710
pretended to be when I appeared to be

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,090
were not the same thing so I began to

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,370
examine my thought process is my

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:23,450
behavior especially how I treated other

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:26,630
people and I especially how he talked

00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:29,270
about people behind their backs I wanted

00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,190
there to be an evil boss concocting

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,440
vicious plans designed to destroy all

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,960
happiness crush me into the ground I

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,440
wanted my problems to stem from I six I

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,200
seven eight nine ten eleven from no

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,470
doughnuts in the kitchen from my boss my

00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,560
coworkers

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,450
at one of the problem to the outside of

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,890
my control and while those and other

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,510
things were at times contributing

00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,360
factors to my unhappiness they weren't

00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:59,500
the root of the problem I had to face

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,910
reality but the problem was me now you'd

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,040
have to actually slow this gift down to

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,660
take about six months that's about how

00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,520
long this realization took place I was a

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:11,170
bit slow but I got there so in 2011 it's

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,880
really probably blurry I became a

00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,040
walking cliché by quitting my job to

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,530
travel europe and find myself figure out

00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,030
i'll figure out all my problems i

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,220
briefly considered calling this talk you

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:27,070
too can become a cliche and encouraging

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:28,780
you all to quit your jobs and travel it

00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,400
was going to be epic but then i

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,540
remembered a bunch of the angular core

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,310
team members are here and we can't have

00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,140
them quitting at least until 2 point 0

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:39,460
is finalized so team you'll have to wait

00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,570
you can become clichés later so

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,380
realizing i was the source of my

00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,760
happiness was not fun especially

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,280
depressing to look at the magnificent

00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,160
works of Bernini da Vinci Michelangelo

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,860
and realized you suck but this

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,740
realization was also freeing I became

00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:00,520
aware of how I actively made choices to

00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:03,270
keep myself from being happy I avoided

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,270
responsibility

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,040
and so when I armed with this knowledge

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,690
and upon my return from my travels I

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,669
began looking for a new job and I wanted

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,500
this new job to be different not because

00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:18,130
it would magically solve all my problems

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,410
but because I could be different so 2011

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,790
in September I started a new job and I

00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,520
made specific goals to keep me from

00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,840
basically being an idiot again and these

00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,260
goals have been instrumental in making

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,410
my current job my favorite job ever the

00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,850
goal number one no complaining so

00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,130
obviously I've been magically complaint

00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:39,520
free ever since instead of complaining I

00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:43,180
sing songs now you know the one and then

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:47,050
other people complain mostly about my

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:49,210
singing ok so I still complain i do but

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,330
i do complain less and i am happier as a

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,289
result here's what i do now instead i

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,389
complain to someone unconnected from

00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:57,400
work I take responsibility for my

00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:59,770
actions and my role in the problem I

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,210
honestly look for solutions and I stop

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:05,050
if it makes me feel bad I don't always

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,580
succeed but I try and I am happier goal

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,530
number two no gossip I was never

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,940
interested in standing around the water

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,360
cooler and we sprang about the private

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:16,539
lives of my co-workers but I did gossip

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,450
about my co-workers their motivations

00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:21,490
their code their decisions their code

00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:25,840
their schooling the code they wrote

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:27,099
their supposed experience it went beyond

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,440
supple complains to being about their

00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:32,770
character has human beings I was this

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,200
guy it took me a long time to figure out

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,300
that that was still gossip my third and

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,279
final goal was to keep the job for three

00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,719
years I thought this was going to be

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,820
impossible all my jobs up to this point

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,980
had never been longer than two I made

00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,160
this to keep me from doing anything

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:50,500
stupid basically I wanted to face up to

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,620
my problems and have to solve them

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,209
instead of running from them i will have

00:08:53,620 --> 00:09:00,300
been at my current job for five years

00:08:55,209 --> 00:09:00,300
this September I thank you

00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,890
have there been problems yeah of course

00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,260
I have had to work on PHP for a while

00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:15,360
now i'm at now angular it's good now

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,540
have I wanted to rage quit yes did I

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,529
know because it would have been stupid

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,880
something if I take a new job it will be

00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:22,410
because I feel it is the right decision

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,510
for my career and family and not because

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,760
of a pile of petty complaints in

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,020
conclusion I learned more than the last

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,510
four and a half years and I've been able

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:34,020
to put into this talk but these three

00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:35,970
goals have been instrumental in making

00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,760
me happier than basically anything else

00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,740
I've done I challenge each of you to

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,270
look at any unhappiness you experience

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,770
at work and identify where it's coming

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,520
from be willing to accept that it might

00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,570
be your fault you might be sad inside I

00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,540
don't know what your specific problems

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:54,270
are might be ember react jquery LOL koj

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,860
yes i don't know but i am confident that

00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,930
whining about it being a jerk and rage

00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,670
quitting aren't going to help what will

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,620
help is committing to solving problems

00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:04,830
instead of hurting yourself and others

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,020
and then finally for those of you who

00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,190
are unhappy work or perhaps even hate

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,600
their jobs and have been awkwardly

00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,459
avoiding eye contact with your boss or

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,160
coworkers next to you throughout the

00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:16,890
duration of this talk i now invite you

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,420
to look them in the eye hello laughs

00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,290
awkwardly and say wow not nearly as

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,290
messed up as that guy was

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,870

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,130

00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:32,970
using this user name on the internet but

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,170
