when how is ng-conf awesome for those of

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,300
you that don't know me I'm Jules

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,680
last year I was part of the angular team

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,910
this year I'm just their best friend but

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,710
I'll always be part of the angular

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,480
community so this is the angular team

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,420
panel it's always been my favorite part

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,330
of in G conf and this year we're gonna

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,650
take mostly live audience questions so

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:34,170
if you have a question find Tara or

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:36,059
frosty over there to get us started I'm

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,160
gonna ask a question of Stephen that

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,670
I've been asked about ten times at the

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,610
conference myself welcome back again

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,260
though well is that welcome back I'm

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,559
always coming back we love having you

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,410
just can't get rid of me good so Stephen

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:58,199
can you tell the audience why ng IV is

00:00:52,410 --> 00:01:01,730
called IV sure sure so I projects so

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:05,040
first of all names don't matter right

00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:07,470
he's clearly in Devereau we tried

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,360
picking a name that intentionally didn't

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,710
have a meaning even though I think

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,320
internally to the team it actually did

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,760
originally have immediate meaning so

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,619
part of the origin story of it was that

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,270
we have a lot of really great open

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,680
source contributors people that we

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,840
include on the team from other companies

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,840
and one of these these groups the

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,909
Amadeus group Pavel Lucas and a few

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,409
others they've been working on some

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,240
ideas around how we could do the

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,820
rendering pipeline better and they

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,970
actually had four instances of that and

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,259
so they were calling an IV we it's not

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,030
the fourth one for us it's actually the

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,890
third renderer for us and so we wanted

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,670
to try and get rid of the number and so

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,619
we went with IV IV y hopefully it

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,909
doesn't confuse anyone hopefully it

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,290
doesn't have too much meaning we just

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,430
want it to be a name because eventually

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,619
it's gonna disappear right it's gonna

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:57,180
just be angular and we'll stop talking

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:58,829
about IV frosty

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,540
we got a we got a question over here

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:05,070
he's ready so I'm an educator all right

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,670
I like to say that I'm helping people

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,619
get into tech and angular as Alissa was

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,750
mentioning is big and there's an p.m.

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,170
and there's getting there's verse

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:18,670
controllers right you go on and on so my

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,690
question is to bring people into tech

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,280
especially front-end development what

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,800
are what do you recommend they start

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,470
with to get to angular because like

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,760
JavaScript you teach jQuery develop me

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,910
to teach all that stuff and they're out

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,160
and they're now immediately behind you

00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,080
know they're behind so what advice you

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,540
guys have for teaching brand new people

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,120
whether it's programs or as myself

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:44,530
building material to help people it's

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,290
Rob why don't you take that question

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,820
that's a really good question so I think

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,320
one of the things that we like about

00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,570
angular and we try to maintain with

00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,430
angular is this basic idea that HTML is

00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:58,310
kind of the core of templating right and

00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,480
so I think for a lot of developers hTML

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,800
is a good place to start getting a feel

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,709
for kind of what it is and how to put it

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,810
together I'll be honest though like I

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:08,959
learned angular as I learned JavaScript

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,400
as I learned HTML right and there's a

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,410
lot of different opinions on this but

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,900
for me one of the things that I like

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,100
about angular is that and I liked when I

00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,989
started back in the you know the very

00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,150
very beginning of angular for me was I

00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:22,010
got immediate feedback and I was

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,769
immediately successful right I was able

00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,120
to build stuff and that got me kind of

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:27,500
sucked into actually wanting to continue

00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,180
to do programming right when you do a

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,680
huge amount of tutorials you learn like

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,769
you know how the world owns do an input

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,730
box and all these things it can get slow

00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:37,400
and you feel like you're not getting

00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,610
anywhere right and so certainly some

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,410
HTML some JavaScript maybe but you know

00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,060
it's it's equally as fine to sort of

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,980
jump right in and run our tutorial right

00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,900
and kind of learn on the fly I'm sure

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,750
other people have other opinions but you

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,180
know that's that's where I came from

00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:58,190
okay this question was asked in the our

00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:00,260
Xterra learn rxjs and Ben had a really

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,290
good response I thought which was that

00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:06,440
he learned by just running up some

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,450
Eric's Jes like mini demo and then just

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,430
playing with operators and I think that

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,430
things like stack blitz provide a

00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,380
perfect way to do this you just run up a

00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:19,280
stack licks and then just start mucking

00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,930
about with the HTML the JavaScript you

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,680
see it immediately happening and you get

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,699
that immediate feedback

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,570
there's nothing better than doing

00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:32,430
hands-on dairy got a question out there

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:37,080
I got one over here in the middle cool

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:40,380
go everyone my name is Eric this

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,720
question is for Igor he or this morning

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,389
in the keynote you mentioned Google

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,289
applying the code of conduct conduct to

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,850
the broader community

00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:55,020
would you mind elaborating a bit on this

00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:58,710
sure when we started with angular eight

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,780
years ago nine years ago we were a very

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,460
small team and back then already we

00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,100
thought you know the only way we can

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,660
build something as big as what angular

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,570
is today and back then we had no idea

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,889
how big it would be we knew that we

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,080
needed help and we need to get more

00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:16,139
people involved so we started thinking

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,210
about the community very early on and it

00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,539
didn't think too long for us to post

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:24,449
code of conduct and start looking for

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:28,349
ways to make people aware of these

00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:31,169
things and help each other and whenever

00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:33,840
they see a problem interfere and and

00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:36,720
stop and deescalate any kind of issues

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,830
and over the years I've seen numerous

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,620
issues on github or just common threads

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:46,590
on git er where I was so proud to see

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,440
the community or even angular team

00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:52,080
members just jump in and deescalate the

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,810
situation say hey maybe you're not were

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,720
but you're being rude maybe you could

00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,870
rethink how you how you communicate with

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,240
us and in many cases it helps you'll be

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,849
amazed you know if you just say hey this

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,159
is not nice that's enough to de-escalate

00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:11,370
many of these situations but sometimes

00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:13,770
it's not and that's when we are still a

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,740
team get these escalations and from the

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,659
community and we get involved and Steven

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,479
me and several other people usually look

00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:23,220
at these things and reach out and try to

00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,490
help and try to figure out what's going

00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,380
on is this a systemic problem it has

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,930
this person been problematic for a long

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,139
time and if that's the case when they do

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,110
reach out directly with

00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:37,300
to them and see hey we see you being

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,629
part of the angular community but you're

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:43,300
not understanding of values we really

00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:46,180
value the welcoming community is very

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,479
important for us maybe you could rethink

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:51,580
how you interact and there were cases

00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:53,349
where we had excellent technical

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,029
contributors and people who were making

00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:57,419
huge difference to angular contributing

00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:59,800
lots of changes lots of improvements and

00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:01,919
we had to bend them from all of the

00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,759
channels stop them from contributing

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,250
because even though they were

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,990
technically super skilled they were not

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,960
being nice to everybody else on github

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,779
they were rude and they were making the

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,550
pace the place very hostile and for us

00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:17,439
even though those technical

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,689
contributions are very important what is

00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,120
more important is that community that is

00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:25,270
building angular feel safe and welcoming

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,789
so in those cases we are willing to take

00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,279
very harsh actions and exclude people

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:32,529
from the community sometimes it's just

00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:36,250
temporary because just giving a warning

00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:37,960
is enough in other cases there are

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,509
people that are still banned and I'm not

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,990
able to contribute or be part of events

00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:46,439
like this because of their past behavior

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,879
we have a question over here from Mike

00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,469
hi this is just more of a generic

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,740
question I think we're all looking

00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:56,199
forward to angular 6 coming out and I

00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,909
know that it was mentioned that other

00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,680
packages are going to be updating their

00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:04,569
versions to six are we going to be I

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,460
guess assuming that those other packages

00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:08,770
will be following the same sort of non

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:12,039
breaking every way P of waiting for the

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:21,129
next version release you know going

00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:23,680
forward and even okay sorry and then

00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:28,149
also that are they gonna follow the same

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,819
sort of LTS sort of timeline that was

00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:32,620
explained earlier on yeah so we use

00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:35,019
semantic versioning for all of our

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,039
packages even those that like a dev kit

00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:38,169
and things like that some of the these

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,120
sub dependencies that we're not bringing

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,409
up to 6 so semantic versioning is kind

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,969
of always how we do things so when

00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,800
there's a major that's where we can

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:45,490
possibly have breaking changes minors

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,200
we're gonna add feet

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,570
patches we're only going to be doing bug

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,850
fixes so we're bringing together the

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,709
kind of I call them the core factors of

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,660
the framework packages so at angular

00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:57,910
core common compiler platform browser

00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,380
platform browser dynamic etc etc all

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,480
those are going to be six and your

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,209
material is gonna be v6 as well as in

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,459
your CLI and the the LTS promise that

00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,290
we're we're making is kind of extends to

00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:09,640
all these things cuz it's really we want

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,200
you to make the decision use angular and

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:15,430
then not have to worry as much about the

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:18,100
easy version numbers so I will make a

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:21,640
small comment on that so we're not

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,260
promising that version 4 or version 6 of

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,020
the CLI is gonna necessarily work with

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,940
version 8 of angular right the ideas you

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,620
move these things together although we

00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,620
do have an N plus 2 for any libraries

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,190
and also just to make sure that we're

00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:42,070
disambiguating this a little bit rxjs

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,050
hop just happens to be at version 6 it's

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,570
it's serendipity that it's at version

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,490
version 6 at the same time so it might

00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,920
not always remain in lockstep because it

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,450
could get could get to the point where

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,250
there aren't many more breaking changes

00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,020
left to make to arch rxjs so it goes a

00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,029
much longer time without you know

00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,700
updating the version but just just to

00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:05,040
make that sure that's clear we have a

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:08,079
question over here from Sean when

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,300
version 6 comes out what does that mean

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:15,579
for the version 4 LTS when can we expect

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:17,890
that to stop being supported when we

00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:21,370
announced the LTS support for version 4

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:23,980
we said that the active part of the

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,490
support would stop when we shipped v5

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:30,399
and LTS for version 4 would remain for

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,800
the next major to major cycles so you

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:37,230
have LTS support for version 4 until we

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,230
release version 7 so six more months

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,459
summarize that is 18 months from release

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,470
so we do six months of active

00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:46,360
development on every major and then

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,279
after that it's 12 months so from

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,440
September 2016 or whenever it went

00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,079
version for tomorrow's March right March

00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,440
of 17 so we have 18 months from March of

00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:58,220
2017 for version 4 and I think we even

00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,830
just did a a one

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,980
first we're working on one of the first

00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:05,750
bug fixes back to version 4 yeah there

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,060
was a security enhancement not a

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:11,150
critical patch but we still felt like it

00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:14,270
was security related so we cherry picked

00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:18,890
it and released obvious version and just

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:20,360
last week I think recently frosty all

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:24,410
right we got a question over here from

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,540
Jacob hi

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,640
I know we are giving a lot of emphasis

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,580
on testing right Q question

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,180
loud snap short testing are we planning

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:42,200
to bring that home supporting snapshot

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:45,230
testing in desparate we don't have any

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:54,860
plans for that but if you want to

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:57,140
contribute here from Gerard over here hi

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,180
Ken will you wait for version 6 but

00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,190
there's a last github comment some we're

00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,670
talking about in version 7 that energy

00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:08,230
module might not be necessary anymore

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,230
could you maybe elaborate a bit about it

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,660
so I've been trying to get rid of energy

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,190
modules for as long as I remember but in

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:23,320
a way that would not be painful to

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:25,760
anybody and with I we we finally have

00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,830
the building blocks that will allow us

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,040
to do that so we'll see I'm not

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:34,820
promising this will happen in v7 first

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,710
goal for us is to get ivy to be fully

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,410
backward-compatible before we start even

00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:42,490
adding any kind of new features that ivy

00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,930
enables and released that so that that's

00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,540
what we are trying to do before we even

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,430
get to these things but yeah we're

00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,610
discussing this we feel like there are

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:54,290
situations especially when you're using

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:57,170
elements where ng modules are just

00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,520
unnecessary complication and in those

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,330
cases you should be able to build

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,920
angular components without ng modules

00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,340
it's fair to say that there I'm over

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,220
here

00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,170
tier 8 hello is it fair to say that

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,970
they're optional rather than we're

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:15,300
getting rid of them

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,709
yes you didn't raise your hand all right

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:22,649
you didn't you didn't call my name out

00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:25,440
when I got on stage that we have a

00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:27,750
question from jewel hi I was just

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,149
curious with the rate at which you know

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,980
all the stuff changes in combination

00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:34,950
with you guys you know traveling and

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,320
submitting blogs and you know videos and

00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:40,620
all that how do you guys balance between

00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,180
family and work and extracurricular

00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,990
activities and all that without feeling

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:53,930
completely overwhelmed that's a rough

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:56,070
question like we are not overwhelmed I

00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:58,620
will say I think one of the things that

00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:01,770
we're trying to do is make sure that the

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,839
the engineering team spends time on the

00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,880
engineering so they can go back to their

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,500
families etc I mean it's if you went to

00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,120
every angular conference now at this

00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,279
point you you would never run another

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,690
line of code because there are amazing

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,459
anger conferences all over the world I

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,630
think the the anecdotal number I keep

00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:18,480
throwing out that I don't have any

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,589
scientific graphing backing is I think

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,810
the number of angular conferences it's

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:23,220
tripled in the last year and so we we

00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:25,200
are not going to be going to all of

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,990
those I apologize you can still ask us

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,700
to let me know we want to know about

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,579
these great conferences but we can't

00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,860
always support them directly but we can

00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:36,079
ask our gde support them around the

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,529
world

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:42,240
yes geez raise your hand all right these

00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,380
people have all gone through an

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,680
interview process a certification

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,800
process that they are experts in angular

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,630
they travel all the time they speak they

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,029
blog their write content we want to

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,890
really empower these people to be

00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:58,170
representatives of angular across the

00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,399
world so if you're if you're running a

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,510
conference and you want to make sure

00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,579
that the team gets home to their

00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,579
families maybe reach out to a GD instead

00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:12,110
so maybe to get back to the question

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,970
anyone have anything that they tried to

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,740
do in their daily life to keep some

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,360
work-life balance I can mention

00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,690
something that the angular team has done

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,520
as a team we have a yoga room well I

00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,200
don't even work there anymore but it's

00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,970
so recent that I still feel like I do

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,800
and I visit the yoga room but we have a

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,690
yoga room so sometimes at lunch we get

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,610
together and do yoga and meditate

00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:39,050
there's a running club what else do you

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:41,660
guys do board games there's lots of

00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:48,620
runners as you mentioned so we often go

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:49,850
running together or go hiking it might

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,130
sound a little bit silly but one of the

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,230
things that comes as part of your Google

00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,960
training is this thing that they they've

00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:59,270
cleverly branded gpause which is

00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,420
literally just take a moment breathe

00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:04,930
reflect be present and then kind of move

00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:08,180
on so hey should we do it together

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,160
no should we do it all right do a G

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,900
pause so just this is a very very short

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,710
energy pause there you go whoever said

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:19,460
that it's genius

00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:20,410
just breathe it's gonna be okay I'll

00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,940
feel better

00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,980
another good suggestion that Brad Green

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,570
had for me personally and I think for a

00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,690
few other members of the team is an app

00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,670
called headspace yeah

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,950
so using headspace can really help you

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,540
keep you know centered so when you find

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,100
yourself working at two o'clock in the

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:42,170
morning five days a week and looking at

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,970
you Igor you might change your attitude

00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,040
about it

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:52,240
another good work/life balance thing is

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:54,650
to just leave at the end of the day I

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,150
also have a recommendation if you work

00:16:54,650 --> 00:17:02,900
from home you don't have a commute so

00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:05,110
that's a lot of free time go back to my

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,110
house

00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:10,400
so do we have another question in the

00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:14,000
audience can see frosty we have one from

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,520
John over here so I actually have like

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,140
two question first question mostly about

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:23,720
the conference what I knew it is that

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:26,360
the team really worked hard for putting

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,720
this conference together so I appreciate

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,060
their hard work but I see like most of

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,280
the talk in general for people from

00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,710
angular team definitely they are very

00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:40,430
best in the angular world but there are

00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:41,750
millions people using angular they might

00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,430
not be working on the latest things

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:47,090
what's coming and the next and next

00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:48,890
things but they're solving angular or

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:51,620
using angular to solve their problem

00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:55,460
might not be shiny things coming next on

00:17:51,620 --> 00:18:00,440
your corner so I feel like there is a

00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:02,960
less representation from that white big

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:08,300
audience group maybe they might not have

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:11,450
liked that good our good talk submitted

00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:14,090
there could be some extra effort or is

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,040
there any guideline to take the real

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:19,100
stories out there where people solve

00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:23,210
their problem in parallel to what's

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:26,480
coming the shiny corner from the all the

00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:31,270
package manager or all the angular team

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,270
at Google team that's question one and

00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:39,750
I knew there was a question in there

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:41,870
somewhere so answer that question first

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,700
before moving on to the next question so

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,800
there's a couple things so one thing

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,230
that to note is actually we don't put on

00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,410
ng cough D and your team we are not the

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:54,180
hosts we are invited to come speak and

00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,190
so we're very lucky so actually a huge

00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:01,779
thank you to the ng-conf organizing team

00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:01,779
[Applause]

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:06,360
they do a ton of work to get the

00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,950
speakers here to make sure that there's

00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,170
a really great content they do surveys

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:13,140
to try and connect all the content to

00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:14,460
what people hear about so maybe if they

00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,960
want to respond to that first part of

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,870
the question the second part that I'll

00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,780
mention very briefly he's all about this

00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:26,580
idea that we all blanking what was the

00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:27,660
second success rate so that's something

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,730
that we're really trying to do a lot

00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,500
better so I don't know we just did a

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,750
blog post last week from Charter who

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,130
they had a great story about how they

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,870
they were designing component libraries

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,570
and things like that and so if you have

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:41,010
those stories let us know let me know we

00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,620
would love to highlight those because a

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,030
lot of clicked so we always say that 90%

00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,920
of angular apps are behind the firewall

00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,480
kind of developed in secret like my

00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,130
company building the coolest thing in

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,830
the universe and I can't tell anyone you

00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,150
can let us know and we can help you tell

00:19:52,830 --> 00:20:00,960
these stories and we can help and your

00:19:54,150 --> 00:20:07,370
developers everywhere okay we have a

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:10,590
question from Julia over here hi future

00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:13,850
soldiers and change detection in angular

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:17,220
I heard a lot of great plans about other

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:19,350
areas and nothing about zone and change

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,740
detection and I feel that it's extremely

00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:25,890
important for performance so I want to

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,780
know I hate videos owned and current

00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:32,570
change detection or you're planning to

00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:36,360
do something cancer future thank you rob

00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:38,580
so the answer that is kind of both right

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,790
I think one of the things we did in v5

00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:43,080
was zones became optional they work

00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,550
pretty well for most people but

00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,890
certainly there are cases that we

00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:48,390
into where they don't work so well and

00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,410
one of those cases for example is

00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,870
elements right

00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,610
and so in v5 we made zones optional so

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,930
that people could begin to experiment

00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:57,060
with you know where we're gonna go with

00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,440
stones so you can pull them out the

00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,410
reason we have them is to know when to

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,270
run change detection right so I think

00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,800
that we we will keep them around as long

00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:07,170
as we need them if there becomes a

00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,610
better solution we will do that there is

00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,410
an effort obviously there's this big

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,000
kind of reactive push on angular right

00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,700
and so there's some some opportunities

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,440
there to you know to maybe change the

00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,790
way we do change detection maybe you

00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:20,640
don't need zones if you're doing things

00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:22,650
in a push kind of way and the new IV

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,630
architecture open ups opens up some new

00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,400
options as well they're kind of long and

00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,690
short of this is that you'll be able to

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,540
continue to use them as long as you need

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,010
to but we are certainly investigating

00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,450
different avenues different ways of

00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,310
doing it different paradigms for this

00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,020
kind of thing because you know users

00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,490
have different use cases certain people

00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,140
who are building you know enterprise

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,360
apps have very very different needs than

00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,560
people who are building you know stock

00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,540
ticker apps that are doing you know

00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,190
thousands of ticks per second so we want

00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,390
to give people the flexibility to you

00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,130
know do the easy button which is what

00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,990
zones do and if you want to then you

00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:56,460
know take very very low level control of

00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:58,110
angular and do what you need to do okay

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:05,280
we got a question from Delvin over here

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:08,120
I work with a small team and one of the

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:11,340
concerns we have is the pace at which

00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,590
angular is evolving angular is changing

00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,240
and this is a great thing because I

00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:18,990
believe the team is adding some

00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:23,160
significant features to the platform but

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:25,530
my concern is breaking changes I'm so

00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,650
happy that you presented on ng update

00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:31,080
and that this will help to to minimize

00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,150
the amount of manual changes and manual

00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:38,880
edits that we have to make to our core

00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:41,490
I'm wondering moving forward the future

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,340
releases are going to have a significant

00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,910
impact on the amount of changes that we

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:50,490
have to make to our code

00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:54,270
Igor Stephan

00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:56,280
I can Vic this one so I think this is a

00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:58,380
good question because I hear from lots

00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:02,460
of people that they fear that our early

00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:05,970
cycle is look too fast for for their

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:09,050
company when we decide and when we

00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:12,090
decided on two major releases per year

00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:13,800
we did it because we looked at what

00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,980
Android was doing what what chrome was

00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,990
doing and those were two extremes chrome

00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,420
releases every three months Android and

00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,190
iOS they release once a year on the web

00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,380
everything changes pretty much every

00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:28,280
month so in order for us to stay

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,300
relevant and stay with the pace of web

00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:36,510
we thought that six months were the

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:40,530
right cycle for angular but having said

00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:45,179
that we understand how painful breaking

00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:48,570
changes are and even for us because my

00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:50,370
team angular angular team supports of

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,950
the applications at Google there is

00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:55,380
currently about 600 applications that

00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:57,270
use angular at Google and whenever we

00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,860
make break and change it's my team that

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:02,130
is responsible for updating those

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,960
applications this forces us not to make

00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:07,170
big breaking changes because we would go

00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,940
crazy and it's good for everybody

00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,890
because it means that there is a sense

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,080
of stability there is a stance but at

00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,730
the same time sense of evolution so

00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,700
we're making big changes IVs a big

00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:19,410
change but the way we are building it is

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,480
backwards compatible because otherwise

00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:23,429
we would not be able to release it so

00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,710
even though we are releasing quite

00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:28,080
frequently I would say that the number

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:31,170
of significant breaking breaking changes

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,970
between version 2 and 6 is minimal I

00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:35,970
can't even think of anything that would

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:38,520
affect every single application right

00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:40,320
now so most of the breaking changes were

00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,990
just corner cases and things that would

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,330
affect a small portion of angular

00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:47,429
developers and whenever we make these

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,110
changes the first thought is like can we

00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:50,850
first deprecated the API can warn

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:53,580
developers not to use this can we

00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:56,490
provide tooling material design the team

00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:59,850
they did an excellent job when they went

00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,510
through a very big transition from MD -

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,820
prefix to mad

00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,889
they released a tool that would update

00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,090
all of the applications and we build

00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:08,889
these tools because we need them for

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,230
ourselves in order to update all of the

00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:15,130
applications of Google Eric chase is the

00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:18,549
same we invested a lot of time into

00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:20,380
backwards compatibility for rxjs v6 we

00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:23,080
built tooling that refractors all of the

00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,669
applications from version 5 to 6 and we

00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,340
use these things at Google to update

00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:28,750
developed applications so I wouldn't be

00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,909
worried about the breaking changes I

00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,490
know that it looks scary on the paper

00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:36,309
but what we hear from developers around

00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:38,740
the world is that updates are actually

00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:40,929
pretty smooth and they feel very

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,230
confident in updating it's not a big

00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:46,419
deal you know I think the creation of ng

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:48,580
update really is is kind of being baked

00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,080
into our mindset as well so now that we

00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,580
have this this kind of centralized way

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,830
of applying these transforms to your

00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,179
codebase as part of the update process

00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,500
we're gonna be thinking that way when we

00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,669
start designing this breaking changes

00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,289
because if you can design them in a way

00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:01,510
that we can tool them that that's gonna

00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:03,279
be better for developers and are really

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,510
big hope in our our big bet is that the

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,309
community is gonna do the same thing so

00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:08,440
that if you have to push breaking

00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:09,580
changes into your package being able to

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,320
take advantage of something like ng

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,399
update and schematics under the hood you

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,480
can help your developer stay up-to-date

00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:21,549
as well we have a question over you oh

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:23,320
okay from she cut hi I'm sue con so my

00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:25,179
question is regarding online courses a

00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,070
lot of you guys I'm sure you guys have a

00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:29,380
lot of online courses which is great

00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:31,330
but most of these are paid contents or

00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:34,000
like in a pro version of it which we

00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:36,970
have to pay for it does Google or

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,669
angular team has any plans or a roadmap

00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:42,340
to make these online contents available

00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:43,840
for free reason is like you know

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,149
there'll be more users and they'll be

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,830
like now if I mean I'm sure there are a

00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:50,980
lot of YouTube courses but they're not

00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:55,179
that professional as you guys are so no

00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:58,330
offense so so do you have any plans to

00:26:55,179 --> 00:27:02,380
make these online courses for free as a

00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:04,269
angular team I think we we always want

00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,889
to make angular io our central spot for

00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:07,659
factual information about angular

00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:10,330
getting started guides tutorials

00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:12,070
techniques those sorts of things I don't

00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:14,550
think we'll ever be able to or want to

00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:16,020
replace the the amazing content

00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,420
the community a lot of its free a lot of

00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,010
its paid we can't replace them because

00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,000
they're bringing something different

00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,310
than what we bring right they're

00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,620
bringing a context that if you find a

00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,750
course that matches your your situation

00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,060
your context you're gonna be much better

00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,560
at learning from them than you could for

00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,240
us because we fundamentally can't

00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,980
address every context that a developer's

00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,320
coming from and so a lot of our content

00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,990
is gonna necessarily have to be more

00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,060
general so I think we want to do better

00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,640
I think we'd love to do videos if we

00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,710
could find the time to make more videos

00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,540
but we we really rely on the community

00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:51,810
because you said that we're better than

00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:53,400
you than them maybe not in terms of

00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,860
building applicative building angular

00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,820
right but we have amazing people on the

00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,890
community they're great at building

00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,880
applications solving problems for for

00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:05,250
developers solving problems for

00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:09,260
businesses in ways that we can't do okay

00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:13,560
we got a question back here from yarrow

00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:16,080
hi my question is regarding the other

00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,690
Google services that already scale in

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,210
Google themselves for instance the

00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:24,480
Google Maps API you can display almost

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,770
half a billion pins on the map itself

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,350
and still scales and it's still

00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:30,210
responsive my question is if we want to

00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:32,640
use Google Maps API with angular how

00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:35,610
much angular adds overhead on top of

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,880
that like if you can answer in in

00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:42,570
seconds for instance like how many

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:45,560
seconds does angular adds on top of the

00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:48,720
native JavaScript or plain JavaScript

00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,310
API that's my first question I have a

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,160
second question but Oh Rob I think

00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:55,080
you're the right so I think if you're

00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,510
using like the the Google Maps WebGL API

00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,900
angular is gonna add little to no

00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:03,360
overhead right that the Google Maps kind

00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,190
of API and like kind of map drop-in

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,480
widgets are fairly self-contained right

00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,830
and so angular can talk to them and say

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,770
you know add a thing or remove a thing

00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:12,780
but I can't think of any specific

00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,520
overhead angular is gonna add other than

00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,560
obviously what angular costs already

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,970
right but I don't think there's gonna be

00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,980
any sort of detrimental interactions

00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,450
between them like angular isn't getting

00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,160
into the you know the Google mapping

00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,070
sort of plug-in or anything like that so

00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:28,790
I minimal impact if if any I think it's

00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,790
the answer that question

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:35,460
and we have a question from yen up here

00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:37,110
I know you're not quite done yet but I

00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,360
was wondering what's next for you guys

00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,680
but instead of listing everything why

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,030
would you be excited that you're gonna

00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:48,030
be working on next I'm most excited

00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:49,470
about taking elements and taking IV and

00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:51,420
putting them together because I think

00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,270
that's gonna be a very very exciting

00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:57,570
very very useful piece of tech Alex

00:29:54,270 --> 00:30:00,750
Eagle what are you excited about I'm

00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:03,240
excited about built tooling I'm excited

00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:05,250
about getting getting the - getting to

00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,530
the point where our internal built tools

00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,750
are sufficiently similar to the built

00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:11,400
tools that you're using that we can we

00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:13,800
can share support and documentation and

00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,600
so on between them but that's still

00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:19,320
under angular labs and it's gonna be a

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,180
while before we have I mean I neither

00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,040
lab is where we do our our big bets the

00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:26,340
things that are things that are still

00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,050
more than one release out so I'm not

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:35,310
gonna give any dates but you weren't

00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:37,800
asking that community contribution

00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:39,690
process so we can accept and better

00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:50,480
process contributions from the angular

00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:54,030
community so stay tuned sure imagine a

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,160
library support from the CLI as of right

00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,500
now a building libraries for angular has

00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,890
been done through the community through

00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,130
a few different packages that are out

00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,950
there

00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,720
so bringing that support into the CLI to

00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,910
be able to build libraries with the CLI

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,179
is one thing I'm really excited to get

00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:18,219
out with six

00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:22,789
work one thing that I haven't heard yet

00:31:18,219 --> 00:31:24,259
it's an Giada Nanji update are for me

00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:25,999
like what I'm most excited about in the

00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:27,649
future and I'm not talking about like

00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:29,269
the next six point overlays I'm talking

00:31:27,649 --> 00:31:32,239
about like maybe a year or two down the

00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:35,809
road n Giada and G update will enable a

00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:38,029
lot of libraries to do to help users and

00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:39,559
developers like really enhance their

00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:42,559
application in ways that we probably

00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:45,049
don't even think about right now but

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:49,969
really like these basing these basic

00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:52,009
blocks that will enable a lot of crazy

00:31:49,969 --> 00:31:56,899
use cases that I'm sure will be super

00:31:52,009 --> 00:32:00,889
awesome hey Kara what are you most

00:31:56,899 --> 00:32:02,239
excited about it like this is so obvious

00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:05,899
but I'm really excited about finishing

00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:13,129
up ivy and making things smaller and

00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:16,039
faster that's it I'm really excited

00:32:13,129 --> 00:32:17,989
about how angular is having a big focus

00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:21,320
on making stuff tree shakable and how

00:32:17,989 --> 00:32:24,049
that's becoming like a known concept and

00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,869
very familiar thing about like in the

00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:28,399
community so that's cool because once

00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:30,889
you get more libraries being pre

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,719
shakable and libraries being built in a

00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:34,969
way that means that they can be tree

00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:37,190
shaped you get like a lot of gains you

00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:38,989
get like it's not just this library

00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:41,089
that's free shakable it's like this

00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:43,519
library uses another and since this one

00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:45,169
is free shakable you don't use that so

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,089
I'm really excited about how in the next

00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:49,279
what year people get a more aware of

00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:51,619
that the tooling gets better at

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:54,109
identifying those things and like we get

00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:56,059
I don't know maybe like a 50% gain out

00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:58,190
of nowhere that we didn't have right now

00:32:56,059 --> 00:33:00,700
because a big part of the community is

00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:04,969
aware of that and I think that's amazing

00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:06,139
so lastly Tina or Jeremy can one of the

00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:09,889
two of you tell us what's most exciting

00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:12,049
in angular material so I mentioned some

00:33:09,889 --> 00:33:13,909
of this in my talk I'm actually most

00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:17,599
excited about the additions we're gonna

00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:19,609
be making to the cdk because well I mean

00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,190
Taylor angular material is really great

00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:24,130
we know a lot of people aren't able to

00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,470
commit to that material design a set

00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:29,170
they want to do something else and so

00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:32,020
being able to provide tooling for people

00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:33,900
to build their own components without

00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:37,210
having to reinvent a lot of stuff is

00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:40,360
really valuable and coming up soon we

00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:43,510
have drag-and-drop and virtual scrolling

00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:49,000
is going to be what we're mostly working

00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:50,860
on after 6.0 cool so I think that's our

00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,600
time for our panel thanks to the angular

00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,950
team for showing up then answering

00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,740
everybody's questions and I'm gonna hang

00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:59,050
it over to frosty and thanks to thanks

00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:04,390
the jewels we're coming back and being

00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:09,010
part of this this event with us okay so

00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:10,629
here's a fact I love this team I need

00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:13,379
everyone to get it loud and say things

00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:13,379
to these guys

00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:32,589
so we just spent three days listening to

00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:38,510
likely the best group of speakers we've

00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:41,349
ever had so everyone show thanks to the

00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,349
speakers to please

00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:54,649
so together with with the angular team

00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:58,709
and the speakers this event can't happen

00:34:54,649 --> 00:35:00,809
without an amazing group of sponsors so

00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:03,259
I need another thanks for the sponsors

00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:03,259
as well please

00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:16,839
I also want a round of applause for

00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:21,029
sunny and her whole entire staff ng-conf

00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:21,029
staff they're fantastic

00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:31,560
without them our home away from home

00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:34,530
here wouldn't exist so a serious thanks

00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:39,690
to sending their team I'm gonna give a

00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:42,650
huge things to Tara who was she was our

00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,650
MC this year

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,960
she helped pick talks which was crazy

00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:56,470
and that was the first thing we had to

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,720
do she worked with us on the code of

00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:01,690
conduct and she's been fantastic to

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:05,770
Werth with so thank you Tara I want to

00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:09,819
say I give a huge thanks to Bonnie Kip

00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:11,349
and Joey for for organizing this event

00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:13,630
and for all the effort they put in it

00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:17,020
literally takes 12 months to id8

00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:19,299
and id8 and reaiity over so many things

00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:20,410
to get an event this electric so big

00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:30,549
round of applause for the ng consonant

00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:32,920
walk and then lastly I want everyone

00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:36,279

for the for the attendees and for the

00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:40,359
community this worldwide because this
