Tara and I we had planned to come out

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,270
here with this weird not weird we're

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,570
going to do a goofy thing where we

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,720
dressed up like Care Bears okay just

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,850
imagine it I was the pink one with the

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,909
rainbow in the belly

00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:25,909
she was grumpy bear for obvious reasons

00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,280
but we're not gonna do that we were

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,100
going to come out and talk about the

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,729
code of conduct and trying to have fun

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:39,180
and in a in a fun way talk about the

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,680
code of conducts but we're gonna talk

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,020
about the code of conduct in a little

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:52,250
bit more stoic way instead so when we

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:54,479
created the ng-conf code of conducts we

00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:59,040
committed everyone who comes in the door

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:02,040
to obey do it right and as organizers we

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,930
committed to enforce it to try and keep

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,720
our events safe and to try to make sure

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,710
everyone here feels welcomed and

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:16,420
included

00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:18,640
we promised to talk about issues if

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,810
there are some times like some of the

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,270
issues we need to talk about as a

00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:26,520
community so if you look around it's

00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,700
your left and your right

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,620
find your co-workers today there's some

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:38,890
people that aren't here that we're here

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:41,350
yesterday and I don't know how many of

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:49,660
you saw when the police were here

00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:58,470
yesterday that's tough as an organizer

00:02:49,660 --> 00:03:02,500
to deal with as has a team of people who

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:06,390
spend a year trying to create a home for

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,390
some friends that's tough

00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:24,750
we all own the enforcement of the code

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:28,680
of conduct right I mean I can I can lay

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,150
down a hammer but the Code of Conduct is

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,030
something that we live it's not

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:39,540
something that I apply or the terror has

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:44,250
to apply and so we want to do a call to

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:48,660
arms everybody - if you see something -

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:51,860
speak up and to get involved in and make

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:55,049
sure that everyone's safe yeah

00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,349
five years ago I got a I started a

00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:01,380
pretty cool partnership with the angular

00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:06,569
team so I wanted to ie go out here to

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:08,310
talk about the code of conduct and as he

00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,500
leads the community from on top which is

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,630
truly my opinion I want him to come out

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,910
and talk just a little bit about angular

00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,910
community so everyone welcome Igor

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,790
[Music]

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:31,590
Hey good morning everybody I was here on

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:34,890
stage last year talking about community

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:37,500
and the values we have I mentioned that

00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,200
angular is about building applications

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,570
that people love to use by developers

00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,830
that love to build those applications in

00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:48,600
a community where everybody feels

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,250
welcome and I believe that we all have

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,890
the responsibility to build that kind of

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,740
community when I talk to people they

00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:58,230
often think that angular is about code

00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:01,440
but for me and for many on the team the

00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:04,140
code is just this by-product a symptom

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,870
of the people that are together in this

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,750
community working together building

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,770
angular if it was if it weren't for the

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:16,410
community I don't think we would meet

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,300
such a great friends and we want more

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,410
people to come and be part of this and

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,570
the way we can do that is by all of us

00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,850
taking the responsibility and making

00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:30,840
sure that everybody around us feels

00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:34,350
welcome because many of us we don't want

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,850
to do anything bad but we also have the

00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,950
responsibility to say something when we

00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,229
see something bad because often it's in

00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,120
the first moments of when you see like

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:43,710
oh this could go bad if you say

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,150
something can stop it and you can make a

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:50,610
difference so for today please be extra

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,430
kind to everybody around you and when

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,720
you walk out of here keep in mind that

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,850
angular community is all around the

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,530
world it's not just in this room it's on

00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,960
github it's and git er it's in many

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,960
different places and you're part of that

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,150
community and you can make a difference

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:13,830
so please do thank you

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:21,240
[Applause]

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:25,210
so I want everyone to know that that uh

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:28,810
when when there's a violation there's a

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:32,410
period of time where you know one too

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:35,770
many people don't feel safe and I want

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,750
everyone to know that that that the

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,340
people involved that didn't feel safe

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:44,919
they feel safe again

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:46,450
okay so it's a thing that had a start

00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,580
and a stop I just want everyone know

00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:51,330
we're not like we're no we're not in

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:56,710
crisis mode okay we're in a mode where

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:59,890
we get a we get a reflect on a bigger

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:02,050
message and our part in that bigger

00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,330
message is kind of happening in our in

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,479
our communities not just the tech

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:14,020
community but in all the communities

00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:16,690
that we run in and so it's up to us to

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,970
make this a safe place to make everyone

00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,280
feel welcome so that's our call to

00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,020
action for everybody is to make sure if

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,190
you see something anyone even slightly

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:29,770
distressed get involved to say hi make

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:37,210
sure things are okay we all have the

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:41,110
power to do that so yeah I can for the

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,669
fifth time it's it's my pleasure to get

00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,330
