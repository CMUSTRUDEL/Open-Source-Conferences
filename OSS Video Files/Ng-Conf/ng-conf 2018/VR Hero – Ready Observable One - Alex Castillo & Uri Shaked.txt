anyway so we are going to show you how

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,090
to build amazing VR we think it's

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,010
amazing engaging VR experiences with

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,679
angular and a bunch of other

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,859
technologies like Eric GS how many

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:21,210
arcgis people the users here observe

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:24,029
robles that's how we say anyway so and

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,580
we got a small surprise for you

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,470
yesterday morning there was a little

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,359
twist in the plot after we watched the

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,690
movie how many of you watched it by the

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,760
way quite a few so after we watch the

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,440
movie we decide to operate the workshop

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,450
with a new device and I need to meet you

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:49,379
at my phone so please do it yourself

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:51,840
make your phone on silent and we have a

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,670
surprise for you it was unplanned but we

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,520
worked yesterday for the entire day to

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,340
add this to the workshop it will come

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,239
later but let's start with the plain VR

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,400
thing so welcome to our workshop today

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,360
we are going to do we are but first of

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,189
all real quick few words about us so

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,140
Alex introduce ourselves

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,780
hi my name is Alice Castillo I'm a

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,080
Google developer expert I'm super

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,380
passionate about the human brain I do a

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,689
lot of projects including air technology

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,070
angular react and this is my favorite

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,380
conference this is where most of my

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:33,479
friends are so I have to do you guys

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,670
welcome thank you Alex and myself Ori I

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,579
love to do project involving new

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,310
technologies so VR electronics robotics

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,220
whatever you want just you can check out

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,490
my blog here and read about what I do

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,100
and without further ado I want to say

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,290
first of all thanks for a friend Monica

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,890
Korova will really help us with your

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,200
workshop she couldn't be here today but

00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:01,680
thank you Monica for helping us to put

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,360
is together and let's think about our

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,009
inspiration for the workshop so of

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,299
course ready player one I asked about

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:11,009
the movie how many of you have read a

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:13,750
book even more so who thinks the movie

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:17,680
is better who thinks the book is better

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,390
who doesn't think at all thank you thank

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,940
you for being honest and the other

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:25,240
inspiration if you watch the movie or

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,740
you are growing the 90s 80s you probably

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,490
know invaders

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,980
space invaders we are going to create a

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,170
little space invaders but the plot is

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,880
going to be a little bit different

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,430
instead of protecting the earth against

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,790
space invaders we are actually going to

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:45,910
be space invaders and we are going to do

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,980
the space invader ceremony this ceremony

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,200
happens when the space invaders are

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,270
getting ready ready to invade a new

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,790
planet so we are going to do the

00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,400
ceremony alex is going to be the master

00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:01,540
of ceremony and they will throw balls of

00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:04,210
energy at you the invader players in

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,820
real life yeah but don't tell them about

00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:10,660
the surprise yet of course not in real

00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:13,270
life and you will have to jump and catch

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:17,130
them but before you can do that we have

00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:21,160
to write a code for that let's go with

00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:23,260
virtual reality so please virtual

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,010
reality this is virtual reality how I

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,010
feel

00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,380
right immersive experience we want to

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,370
pull our brains to things we are in a

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,810
different world

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:36,640
not real don't before and we have the

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,770
headset of course and we have

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,730
controllers so we have a lot of gadgets

00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:44,830
that let us manipulate the virtual world

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,450
anyone missing one of the cardboards

00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:51,610
please raise your hands okay so we have

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:53,350
one okay and today as I mentioned we

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,769
have a surprise it's related to take

00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:59,769
controllers but I got quiet

00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:02,620
Sandman can you fix this okay perfect

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:04,750
but more on that later so without

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:09,100
further ado let's good I want everyone

00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:11,850
to follow this really quick introduction

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:15,130
to WebGL in order to create 3d worlds

00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:17,230
for VR we need to use some technology

00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,900
and WebGL is how we create ready for the

00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:22,390
web so yeah it should be pretty easy

00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,760
just a few lines of code and then we'll

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,850
see the amazing result so first of all

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,400
we create again it can

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,020
we create a new WebGL context we clear

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,930
the viewport so we have a black screen

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,940
we create a buffer of verticals so we

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,770
know where to grow the point yeah we

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,330
create a vertex tray there will explain

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,100
the planer it's not important

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,100
I will create a fragment shader that

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,080
gives color to the points then we need

00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,720
to compile the shaders create a program

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,570
associated to program link it use it of

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,280
course then I have no idea why this is

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,870
needed but I don't know why it's needed

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,840
no one knows

00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,120
and finally we drop the array of all the

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,580
things that we did and we get is really

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,160
amazing result it was worth writing all

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:09,510
this code in order to get a pixel on the

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:14,340
screen so this is WebGL and when I first

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:17,190
saw it this is how I felt and I didn't

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,900
want to do whoa it's it's show you

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,290
doesn't want to move to the next slide

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,750
I'll try yeah this is how I felt I

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,150
didn't do want to do any 3d on the web

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,370
anymore

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:32,190
luckily things have got a little better

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:35,010
thanks to Mozilla which created a new

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:37,830
library called a frame it's based on web

00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,840
components and it makes we are a little

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:44,400
bit easier than what we have you have

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:48,210
just seen so how many of you watch this

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,400
technically it's stuck so for those who

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,190
don't hear it now you are going to meet

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,110
Stiglitz now I really really loved it

00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,660
when I saw the Turk so I decided to try

00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,530
to use it for the demo which basically

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,840
means you are going to open this URL

00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:07,530
HTTP origin or flesh VR and if

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:12,000
everything works you will see the hell

00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:15,230
new angular app page so this is HTTP Soh

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,750
that herb /vr while you are connected I

00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:20,310
will wait for a moment because we'll

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,260
probably take some time for the page to

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,870
load have anybody got it loaded on their

00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:28,580
phones or laptops yeah and how much

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:30,870
people doing with the headset

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,870
were you able to put it together pretty

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,070
easy huh yeah five steps if anyone have

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,790
questions about how to put it together

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,260
yet thank you yeah so why do you are

00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,420
getting connected

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,070
- this experience can anybody show me

00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,830
our screen or phone just so it C doesn't

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,750
work ok perfect I see a lot of angular

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,450
loggers they should have taken a selfie

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,340
with that so I hope everybody had a good

00:06:51,450 --> 00:07:02,370
time getting connected we are not

00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:04,800
getting sound up okay so right now we

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,110
are going to switch to the coding mode

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,330
and in coding mode you have this welcome

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,130
app I'm going to check that it works for

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:15,180
you if it works for you you should see

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:17,040
the word it works on your screen it

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,470
should library load does it work for

00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,340
anybody do you see it works on your

00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:25,740
screen look at your own screen yes so we

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,200
have an early-bird cool so stiglitz

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,060
works right now I have no idea why I

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,800
don't see the amount of people connected

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,440
it should have shown to me before still

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,800
waiting yeah is it still loading for

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,540
people oh yeah perfect it works so since

00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,550
it works we can start coding with a

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,620
frame and for that we are going to use

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:47,340
the custom components custom elements

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,290
that a friend introduced into HTML the

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,380
first one is called a scene it's just a

00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:56,100
wrapper for all our virtual reality and

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:59,910
it's not happy because angular does not

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,400
recognize this async component therefore

00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:05,580
it gives us a hint if a scene is the web

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,370
component which is it it is we need to

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:12,510
add a custom element schema to our ng

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:14,490
model schema let's do that by the way

00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,290
everything we do here this is our app

00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,920
module it is just a few imports we'll

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,980
use later

00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,380
everything we do here is also written in

00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,120
our github repo and we prepared at

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,000
playbook for you which you can follow

00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,240
later with everything that we did so no

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,860
worries if you miss one or two parts so

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,430
we're going to add this custom element

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:39,120
schema to our schemas part of the

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:41,669
application I have to get used to this

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,400
editor and it will still say it works

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,710
it shouldn't oh it should I removed it

00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,260
and the next thing we are going to do we

00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:52,290
are going to add some 3d objects that

00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,310
would be a sphere and we will position

00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:59,850
it

00:08:53,310 --> 00:09:02,250
we'll give it a position of x0 y 1.5 Z

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:05,730
minus 5 so it's into the screen and you

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:08,160
can see let's also give it a color

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,470
I love eating someone so let's make it a

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,740
salmon color yeah that's a valid HTML

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:17,939
color and it's still not happy maybe I

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:22,379
have to just make it realize that I

00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:24,269
changed the file and I guess you can all

00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:27,569
see now this sphere on your screen

00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:29,579
anybody sees it do you get it on your

00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:30,149
phone or your computer not on the screen

00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:32,279
on your phone

00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:37,649
yeah does it work yeah technology works

00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:39,600
all right okay so at this point you can

00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:42,089
probably look around by moving with your

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,920
mouse or with just your phone it should

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:46,319
work if you want you can try it with

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,629
your BR it set and while we are at it

00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:51,750
let's add some more interested in

00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:58,550
squeezing let's I sky and the sky color

00:09:51,750 --> 00:10:03,149
will of course be sky blue Hades

00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:05,279
yeah okay this quotes but we got a sky

00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:08,370
and I think the next thing we want to

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:12,269
add we want to add some reference some

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:17,639
floor so we had a plain colorful yellow

00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:21,540
colored plane we can give it a size of

00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:23,519
five by five the sizes are emitters I

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:27,569
know we are they in the US but this was

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:31,319
created with imperial units with metric

00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:35,069
units in mind and then let's also give

00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:39,269
it a position of zero zero minus five

00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:41,220
just below the sphere and when we are

00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:43,259
saving we should see there is a sphere

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,139
and there is a plane but the orientation

00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:49,740
of the plane is incorrect it's some

00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:53,550
rotation yeah great idea let's do some

00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:57,689
rotation so it will be perpendicular to

00:10:53,550 --> 00:11:01,559
the sphere and well mmm nice thank you

00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:03,689
and now we have this sphere and a bunch

00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,000
of shadows that's a good idea let's add

00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:06,780
some shadows that just add this shadow

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,390
at will

00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,190
to the sphere and to the plan and they

00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:15,480
should both participate in the shadow

00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:18,750
system so now we got some kind of low

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:23,520
world - a frame so you're telling me

00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:26,760
that we just a few a few HTML elements

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,800
were able to get a 3d scene with sky

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,990
when a ball with shadow and you can

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,720
actually see it in 3d and we in a

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,580
virtual reality setting right just five

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,190
lines of code compare it with what we

00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,870
had with WebGL for that pixel I think

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:44,490
that's pretty good back to the bug yeah

00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:46,620
totally so now we have like the basic

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,080
world and we want to get you into this

00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:52,350
world so we are going to use firebase

00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:55,920
for that we already created some service

00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:58,770
called the user presence service and

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,420
this service has a lot of code we are

00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,620
not going to go over it you can do it

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,510
later at home

00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,400
but there are two important things you

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:09,210
can see that whenever it is in the

00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:12,270
constructor we actually create a new

00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:14,690
user F object which has a random color

00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:18,720
and random X and Z position so whenever

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:20,970
these scene loads on one of your laptops

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,160
or phone you will actually be given a

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:25,710
random color random X and Z and this

00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,060
will be pushed to firebase I see so it

00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:30,510
basically sent it to fire went to the

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:32,970
cloud with some custom color so everyone

00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:35,100
that joins has their own user objects in

00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,520
firebase right with a color and position

00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,380
and then we have this observable don't

00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,810
worry about this code basically it will

00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,970
give us an array of the users that are

00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:48,630
currently logged in and we are going to

00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:50,880
bind it to this fur so let's go back to

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:54,300
our first of all let's go to our

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,520
component and inject the service I'm

00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,640
going to cheat here and use a snippet

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,750
yeah it worked right thanks these are

00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,790
the services that we're gonna be using

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:06,030
throughout the workshop huh yeah so

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:09,270
that's a little spoiler and let's head

00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:13,050
east user presence which is a five user

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:15,870
presence that we're using in the

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:19,080
constructor for the component flat right

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,430
so we are going to use to take the

00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,250
user's observable

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:27,930
they're users though are equals user

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:29,190
presence this diffuser presents I was

00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,230
always curious about that dollar sign

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:33,360
but that is pretty much its semantics

00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,680
for this is the type of observable so

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480
when you're working with it

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,790
you know pretty special II as an

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,590
observable right it just reminds me that

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,560
this is an observable just the coding

00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:45,090
convention good point Alex thank you and

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,330
now what we are going to do we are

00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:50,310
basically going to ng4 over our users

00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:54,180
and create a sphere a different spheres

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:59,550
for each user so we are going to ng for

00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:02,370
for user in oh let's user of users

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:05,100
though are it's an observable so we need

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:07,140
to use the async five right and then we

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,630
are going to attach the color attribute

00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:14,910
so that's the attribute binding syntax

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:17,520
of angular to user that color that makes

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,140
sense so we're using the iterated user

00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,490
and we just using whatever color we

00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:23,130
assigned initially from the service

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:26,010
right and let's do it the same for the

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:30,560
position so here we have a little bit of

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:33,470
a challenge because position actually

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,940
expects an object when it's assigned

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:39,750
dynamically so we are going to create

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:43,710
such object with X that would be the

00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:45,390
user X Y would be just one point five

00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:48,990
meters above the ground as we have here

00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:52,250
and Z would be the user dot Z likes Li

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:56,280
from the movie you remember him yeah and

00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:58,770
since angular doesn't really play well

00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:01,230
with a frame we need to do some work

00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:03,930
around using a pipe called the a-frame

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,330
pipe you can find it on NPM and this

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,820
pipe will just convert this object into

00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:11,070
something that a frame can work with so

00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,140
hopefully as soon as they save this

00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,420
types trip is a happy so as soon as I

00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,460
save this it will be scattered with

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,280
balls and we'll be able to see how many

00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,920
of you are in there and how well these

00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:28,320
really think scales we haven't tried it

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:30,690
with so many users I see one ball yeah

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,020
yeah it's starting to reload for

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,990
everybody so yeah

00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:39,390
Wow this is crazy

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:41,300
I love that I love that thank you thank

00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:44,190
you

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,240
so yeah I think it's time to add a

00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,029
little bit more

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,450
chicness like more starting to distill

00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:55,370
make it more like a tea style let's hope

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:58,980
this treaty won't kill my browser though

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:03,180
so let's start with the floor actually I

00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:05,790
want to use an animated gif I think it's

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,550
it fits well with the 80s right yeah

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,980
it's retro right yeah so first of all we

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:14,160
need to add an asset section to our sin

00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:18,120
and in these assets we are going to load

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:22,050
gifs will do IMG let's give it a give

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:25,470
idea of that would be Fleur texture and

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:28,410
the source would be I already got it

00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:32,040
ready ready flirted if I think that's

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:34,950
the name so we're just a acid is just

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,470
Austin heck frame that we want to import

00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:40,110
this and we give it an ID and a source

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:43,380
so then we can reuse it through our our

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:46,230
a frame semantics tree exactly reuse is

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,510
the key here and then we can change the

00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,709
plane that we created instead of giving

00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,510
it a yellow color

00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:53,160
let's also remove the shadow that will

00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,350
improve the performance and we won't

00:16:53,160 --> 00:17:00,000
need it later

00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:03,930
right right and we can replace the color

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,300
with just material and we'll use the

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,760
gift shader which super exports for

00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:12,020
animated gif and tell it the source for

00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:15,870
this material is inside this floor

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,730
hashtag blur texture image now we are

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,400
going to save and if everything works

00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:24,990
well we'll have animated gif on this

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,959
theme night but it's a little bit too

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:30,420
small for dancefloor I'm shooting we

00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,240
just like make it whole floor yeah let's

00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:36,030
make it like really big like 300 by 300

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:40,350
meters how much does one 1000 feet I

00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:42,770
think Allah and also we will need to

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:46,220
repeat the texture so it won't stretch

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:48,500
so let's repeat it 100 by 1

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,480
with time and I think we are going

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,929
getting yeah we're getting something

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,710
here alright we're on to something or

00:17:53,929 --> 00:18:00,049
maybe not

00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:03,260
oh I know there is a Cullen after repeat

00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:07,190
it's like CSS with a train stuff and now

00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:09,350
we got it work this is us up let's do

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,110
the same let's give the sky the same

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,840
treatment we have a star tech chure for

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:17,780
you so that would be the sky tech chure

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:21,470
and it would take the stars to give and

00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:25,669
then we discuss the sky we can say the

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:28,659
same material equals shader gift this

00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:33,650
time I'm not going to forget the Cullen

00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:38,390
SRC would be the sky texture and we will

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:41,360
repeat it 5 by 10 times so just it will

00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:44,990
be more scattered let's save and see if

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,510
we got stars in the sky every happy

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:51,200
happy it's white and it's sorry

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:54,049
and it's animated dancing so it so many

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,120
balls we're taking a gif or Jif or

00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:58,960
however you say it and you are applying

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,640
it in a 3d environment as a shader

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,740
material innate right here right there

00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,820
are so many invaders if it repeats

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:10,690
scales yeah it Webster Gale ok the web

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,400
scarce yeah so I think the next thing

00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,530
you are supposed to be invaders and just

00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,580
not just those floating in the this

00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:21,740
party space so for that we're going to

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:25,460
use a 3d model of an invader we are

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,610
going to load it from another asset so

00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:32,570
let's create an asset PvP ID of let's

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:36,740
call it invader objects and the source

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:42,080
will be just the tag the source will be

00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:44,270
it's inside assets invader to that

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,340
object ext the reason I needed to use

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,230
the if the extension is some limitation

00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,450
of cyclists hopefully they will fix it

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,309
soon other than that it's great but I

00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:55,399
think it's amazing that we're having an

00:19:52,309 --> 00:19:56,690
ID right now on the browser and we're

00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:59,220
collaborating with like everyone here

00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:01,860
yeah we couldn't do that without Specter

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,600
I mean you would have to deployed to get

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:09,540
a bell and people have to be refreshment

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,400
that's so it is yeah anyway okay so we

00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,970
are going to replace replace replace

00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:18,870
this fierce with a of Jamaat oh yeah

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:21,530
which basically tells a frame that we

00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:24,870
want to load an object model that is 3d

00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:28,130
object format and we only need to add

00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:31,320
SRC attribute that will point to our

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:34,080
invader herbs so we're pretty much

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,810
referencing by ideas like we did before

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,870
and I hope it works let's see let's save

00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:41,700
and see are we all invaders now are we

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,760
are we are we that was too easy an

00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:48,360
innocent workman ah yeah it was too easy

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,940
but I this is something I think it's

00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:54,080
that the browser doesn't like the amount

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:58,550
of object it has to render right now

00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:01,680
yeah do you see it how many of you see

00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:03,720
most of you so your my computer needs to

00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,450
be replaced across just like try zooming

00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,670
out yeah now I think maybe I'm not

00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:14,370
looking at the right direction or but

00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:17,160
you see that's what important yeah you

00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:19,950
see the other invaders though can you

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,890
showed it can you show me please whoa

00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:24,450
that's crazy

00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:26,190
okay well that's how it works I don't

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,230
know why didn't work for me but they

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,960
will probably work in the next reload

00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:34,320
and now what we are going to do I think

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,150
you are the invaders and we want you to

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,670
be a part of this pretty world we are

00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,930
creating if it doesn't work we load or

00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:47,280
use your friend's computer every time

00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:49,770
yes and we want you to be a part of this

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,820
invader world so what we are going to do

00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:55,830
now we are actually going to attach to

00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,080
your camera that's your phone moving

00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,970
around it's moving big a frame camera

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,180
and we are going to listen for your

00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,170
rotation and reflect this rotation into

00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,470
firebase

00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:09,240
let me show you so we are going to first

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,800
of all at me that's cool because you

00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,270
have different attitudes it has like the

00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,790
assets you have the

00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:17,640
you have the plane and are you going to

00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:19,410
add another entity of a camera yeah in

00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,150
order to take the control of this camera

00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:27,570
we are going to add another camera

00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:30,920
entity if my browser will not die yeah I

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,920
think I think it killed it

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:37,350
so camera entity do you want to come or

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:41,760
not let's try that again if not I have

00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:44,760
some cheat sheets okay time for a cheat

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,990
sheet don't tell anyone about this this

00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:53,490
never happened yeah yeah luckily we have

00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:56,370
this cheat sheet I think my browser just

00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:59,100
gave up on it like you see it doesn't do

00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:01,080
a syntax highlighting nothing let's

00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:05,190
write and see if this work basically

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,210
what I'm doing here listening I'm taking

00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,120
control of the camera

00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:12,000
those blue controls basically tell the

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,860
browser to rotate the camera whenever I

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,650
reverted the phone they are used for the

00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:20,040
phone version of this and it was

00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,720
controls can you guess what they do let

00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,170
me control the camera with the keyboard

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,760
first or the kids right and then we have

00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:30,840
this rotation listener it's another

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:33,450
element that extends a frame it's on NPM

00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,240
and it will emit a rotation change event

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,610
whenever I rotate my phone same for the

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,650
position and since these are just web

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,130
components we can use the event by text

00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:47,130
index of angular to connect them to

00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:51,150
events in our component and analyse

00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:52,920
syntax highlighting loaded Wow the web

00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,890
structure now like physics into just

00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:59,280
point HTML right now right Wow so let's

00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:04,650
implement those event listeners in our

00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:06,960
code so basically I think I think it

00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,460
totally gave us up let's save and Fri

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,150
trillo's maybe this will help

00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,150
yeah

00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:25,889
and if not oh now I can also people

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:28,200
connected so did it save the camera yes

00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:30,450
we have the camera now you'll probably

00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,970
have a lot of errors sorry for that I

00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:38,840
didn't implement the listeners before

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:41,490
itself but it's like I could see you oh

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,389
we are everything in a performance issue

00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:48,299
here do you see this yeah why is that

00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:50,429
yeah well I shoot do we have any shadow

00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:53,039
let lingering around because those are

00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:55,769
pretty expensive actually no but if you

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:59,220
see this ng4 you will probably notice

00:24:55,769 --> 00:25:01,860
that it renders the entire Annie you

00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,139
need to track by it right right that's

00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,919
basic how didn't I think about that

00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:07,350
myself

00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,330
so we'll try it by a user ID function

00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:12,779
and let's create this function in our

00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:14,789
controller if you can get there and we

00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:18,960
shall say to explain the problem

00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:19,860
whenever we are using an NG for angular

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,450
whenever there's a change detection

00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,799
angular has to rewrite there every

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,350
single item because it doesn't know

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:28,200
exactly what change so by tracking by in

00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:30,690
a specific property of each items then

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,850
it only rear Enders and want to actually

00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,440
change and that's why it's faster

00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,779
because it doesn't kindly do everything

00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,559
every single time so yeah for every user

00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:42,809
it has an ID property that is populated

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,440
by firebase and then we are just going

00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:48,210
to track by use this track by user ID

00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,399
yes that's how we call it create this

00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:53,190
function on our controller that will

00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:56,460
make the tracking happen now the browser

00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:58,679
is really really sad because still

00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,809
uploading because I did something really

00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:04,110
bad here in terms of performance but

00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:06,779
luckily sorry I killed your battery but

00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:10,470
luckily it's now reloaded and why

00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:13,100
doesn't it work it does just yeah I mean

00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:17,639
there are like 100 people on this Wi-Fi

00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:20,490
plus there's almost 40 people right

00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:22,470
right so it's fast now it will probably

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,360
login into far base in a few moments and

00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:27,840
we'll see the users but first of all

00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:31,529
let's implement the missing methods for

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,840
the rotation and orientation so first

00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:36,929
thing first let's add this rotation

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,110
change listener and we are getting its

00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:43,200
correct value which would be a frame the

00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:45,450
coordinate that component coordinate

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,909
which is basically an object with XYZ

00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:51,480
and then we can tell the user present

00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:53,460
service to update my rotation with this

00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,250
value and it will write a new rotation

00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:00,210
value to firebase by the way anybody any

00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:02,279
of you seen invaders on the screen No so

00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:04,429
we screwed up something really waiting

00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:08,059
for us to implement a let's see if

00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:13,159
implementing those methods hell yep

00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:16,230
update my rotation update my position

00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,149
let's say I see a bunch of errors

00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:21,929
probably because of the missing events

00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:28,350
and let's see so right now we should

00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:37,440
have yeah now long your errors do is if

00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:39,450
you here oh so friends we are doing it

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,990
all the better if you see me do silly

00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:45,809
mistakes like putting the async pipe in

00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:49,679
the wrong word place or forgetting track

00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:51,570
by just let me know or Alex will okay I

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,809
will save that and hopefully now we have

00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:57,629
invaders and those invaders are going to

00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:59,759
be all around the place and with high

00:27:57,629 --> 00:28:04,490
performance without flickering without

00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:08,220
without killing my browser and yeah

00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:10,860
there you go no flicker browser is still

00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,889
slow but no flicker and we have invaders

00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,799
so the look a little static though what

00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:19,200
can we do so yeah so now we saved

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,210
whenever you rotate your phones we

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,350
actually save this to firebase you can

00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:27,450
see it real brief these are the methods

00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,429
that are called update my rotation just

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:32,159
updates the current user with rotation

00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:35,410
eeks and rotation Y same goes for update

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,450
my position updates it with X&Y I see

00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:42,210
somebody has already got ahead somehow

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:44,860
and is updating its position yeah nice

00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,680
so we just need to bind those new

00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:51,370
rotation and position to the users so we

00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:53,200
have those users here remember this is

00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,610
the object model and repeat it for each

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,650
user later yeah

00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,750
each invader we already set a position

00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:01,960
we now just need to take care of the

00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:04,120
rotation so we say at her third rotation

00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:08,770
we bout bind to the rotation attribute

00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:12,280
of a frame equals x would be quotes yeah

00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:16,660
X would be the user that rotation X Y

00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:18,730
would be user the rotation Y & Z would

00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:22,240
be 0 because we don't want your work to

00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:28,210
rotate on the z-axis yeah that's yeah we

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:32,320
don't want me to go sideways I think it

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:35,470
comes and I'm going to save this so this

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,930
applies to every single one of you and I

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:40,810
think now we should be seeing a lot more

00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:44,110
updates oh it's so good we implemented

00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:46,210
this async pipe to make sure that we

00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:48,820
don't we render everything on every

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,810
update and the Wi-Fi is having a hard

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:54,610
time with all of you thank you for

00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:56,950
choking the white pipes we will show

00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:00,880
ng-conf but a group of three our heroes

00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:03,640
can do to the Wi-Fi and still waiting

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,660
for five days so while we are waiting

00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:09,010
for five days I'm going to does it show

00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,790
for any of you by the way

00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:14,680
or did we screw up with no invaders no

00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:17,380
invaders I think we usually do at the

00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,050
pipe a frame just to let alright the

00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,960
apron pipe thank you so much others yeah

00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:24,240
yeah I tell views it's good to have you

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,350
here thank you

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:32,470
so we now may get this work thank you a

00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:38,280
frame angle our firebase god of live

00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:42,310
demos please Meiji words anything

00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:44,680
anybody see if you are here is everybody

00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:48,380
and I want you to rotate move around

00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:50,840
like right somebody's dead

00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:53,539
the people in the floor I think okay

00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,980
that's the people on the floor yeah you

00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:57,200
might you might zoom in on a little bit

00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,419
so we can see like yeah you can if you

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,759
are using a laptop you can walk around

00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:04,970
with your keys I just killed my browser

00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:07,190
sorry for that and you can do like

00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:09,230
amazing things now I hope you get better

00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:11,440
performance on your phones maybe you can

00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:17,360
open it on your phone so I will see

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:20,240
actually working yeah I think that for

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,210
the next step I will hide this preview

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,009
how do I do that close I was hiding

00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,980
spree view otherwise we won't be able to

00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:29,450
write the next slide a few lines of code

00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,080
so but you have it on your phone so it's

00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:32,690
all good

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,149
so I think one more thing I wanted to

00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:38,690
add here right now we are all viewing

00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:41,210
this theme from the center of this world

00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:42,740
so you are also seeing your avatar but

00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,509
it's not in yours

00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,830
you're not standing there where it

00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:50,029
should be not on your point of view

00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:51,529
right yeah so since we already have your

00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:55,509
position we are tracking the camera

00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:58,159
position and we know your initial X&Y

00:31:55,509 --> 00:32:00,529
because we chose them randomly we can

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,320
make the camera started that position so

00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:07,730
each one of you see is this thing from

00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:10,879
is own point of view for that we'll just

00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:13,129
need to do two things first of all we

00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:16,639
need to go to the app component and

00:32:13,129 --> 00:32:18,740
there is another observable we can

00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:22,370
subscribe to on the user present service

00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:25,279
called me and this observer basically to

00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:28,220
that me that's you know me that's me

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,279
that's me okay but never mind

00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:37,009
and we'll subscribe to it and save the

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:39,590
value to my component controller this

00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:43,399
does mean equals value and let's define

00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:49,639
me me is a type a user or users and now

00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:53,929
we should have me updated in this in

00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:59,010
this component and then we can change

00:32:53,929 --> 00:33:01,560
our controller our views so

00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:05,580
instead of just placing the camera at

00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:08,040
the beginning at 0 0 at 0 & 1 6 0 we are

00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,830
going to wrap it with another any entity

00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:13,800
and that will be the current element of

00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:17,250
the camera you kind of bring in the

00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:19,830
camera to the current user orangy that's

00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:22,770
true I'm going to give the current

00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:27,090
entity a position of let's just copy

00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:29,280
face because yeah it's like like I

00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:32,640
usually code but I do copy paste from

00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:34,920
stackoverflow I do that all the time yes

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,860
so let's change it instead of user data

00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:41,430
links and user does it to meet at X and

00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:43,770
meet of Z so now my camera is standing

00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:46,500
where I am it I'm not going to say that

00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:49,740
anyway at this moment because if I do

00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,210
you will all see a very big avatar

00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:55,650
looking your field of view and that

00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:57,990
would be you you yes right

00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:00,780
so another small fix we are going to do

00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:02,820
I think it forgot to close this a entity

00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,010
right here oh you're right right I

00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:08,100
always fall for that so now it's happy

00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:11,700
and I'm going to do another trick I'm

00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:18,780
going to say for each of this user it

00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:21,330
will be only visible if it is not me so

00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,820
right now I'm going to save and you

00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:26,610
probably should see yourself I'll try to

00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,710
I will risk open this myself and you

00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:31,710
should probably see yourself teleporting

00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:34,370
to teleported to each one will have a

00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:37,260
different view from a different position

00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:39,179
I'm here some of you will need to turn

00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,480
around in order to see the other crowd

00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:48,120
and somebody's looking to the sky during

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:50,340
service yeah yeah so Wow

00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,350
so many invaders yeah I think we're

00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:58,220
ready for the part where you jump

00:34:52,350 --> 00:35:02,790
yeah so for that we are going to use the

00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:07,920
observer the observer of the table yeah

00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:10,680
I win a car but you are okay so for that

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,500
part we are going to use another service

00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,530
I created for you are not going to

00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,660
overly code but basically it has it

00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,520
listens to the device motions events

00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,740
from your accelerometer so if you are on

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,770
the phone you can actually jump and it

00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:26,960
will make the Avatar jump and we are

00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,090
also for those of you with left up

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,630
because for some reason most if you have

00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:35,780
laptop set no idea why you can also use

00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:38,420
the space key you see I fill there by he

00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,850
equal space to trigger a jump and

00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:44,720
whenever you do we just merge those two

00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:47,180
observers into a jumps observable so you

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,580
basically have the device orientation in

00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,260
the keyboard into a single observable so

00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,880
the user can decide either to use their

00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:56,540
phone or the computer and it we just

00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:02,240
work right that's true Alex so let's add

00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:05,540
this to the code yeah I want to goes

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,420
through it quickly just to be aware of

00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:13,220
time it's a yes so let me quickly up

00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:18,680
this jump detection is jump detection

00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:20,810
service these over to complete me today

00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,480
and we are going to subscribe to these

00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:25,730
jumps so I'm pretty much very similar to

00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:30,710
what you had before right go subscribe

00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:33,380
and drive would it be jumps or just oh

00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:35,500
there you go jump yes and whenever I

00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:38,390
jump I want to update not just myself

00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,160
everybody in the since so we are going

00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:44,450
to update the user presence service

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:47,150
we're and say set jumping with the new

00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:49,460
value and what's a jumping does is

00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,880
basically we're adding it would just be

00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,180
me

00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,610
I wanted my self yeah but I want

00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,470
everybody to see you jumping I so it's a

00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:59,510
collaborative experience you want to let

00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:01,730
them know that you're jumping and I you

00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:04,100
see yourself jumping exactly and that

00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:07,250
would update the jump property of your

00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:09,410
user in firebase okay so once we have

00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,480
that in place we know that we have a

00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,410
jump property for each user and we can

00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,570
visualize it

00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:19,700
let's start by visualizing good for

00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:22,730
ourselves so we have this a entity with

00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:26,330
your position and we are going to change

00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:28,910
the Y the height of you when you jump

00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:31,610
we will do it just by safe if neither

00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:35,360
jump then I want the height to be 1.5

00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:37,760
otherwise it will be 0 my god yeah just

00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,970
visualize the jumps and I want also to

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,400
visualize the jumps off me of all of you

00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,740
not just you everybody

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,020
so we'll do it again here copy paste if

00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:51,890
user is jumping then let's put it 3

00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:55,670
otherwise 1.5 so I'm going to save and

00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:59,690
hopefully we'll have jumps yes opened up

00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:04,880
and if everything works well we'll see

00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:06,560
invaders will we will we will we you

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,150
know I have an effeminate cavil right

00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,970
could have used up and guess super

00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:12,830
Internet why didn't I no worries

00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,600
anyway I want to see some of you

00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:16,910
starting to jump so you can do it read

00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:20,030
your phone among guys get up do it or

00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:23,090
with your laptop's yeah there you go all

00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:24,610
right I'm jumping you can see there you

00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:28,610
go

00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:30,140
there is a big pile of I think avatars

00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:33,410
name is hanging out in there they are

00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:36,200
hanging Diaries talking yeah yeah yeah

00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:38,090
cool so anyway before my browser dies

00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,850
again let me close this preview alright

00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:44,150
so what's next we need to show them some

00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:46,010
very cool effects yeah so I think for

00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:48,080
the next part we are going to implement

00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:50,869
to you as the master of ceremonies that

00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,850
send this power blast to everyone

00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:56,330
yeah are you ready with your laptops and

00:38:52,850 --> 00:39:02,300
the slides actually ok ok let's do it

00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:05,930
here so tell them about our surprise

00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:08,690
great guys so there's a physical aspect

00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:11,810
to this which is we're going to be using

00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:13,880
a sensor a bio sensor and I actually I'm

00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:17,480
wearing it right now you cannot see it

00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:20,240
actually if I just start you are hiding

00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:23,450
it under your sleeve true magician amaya

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,400
sensor which is just so good gesture

00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,990
control device that couldn't be a

00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,720
bluetooth and send shocking events to

00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:31,760
our application so he's read my muscle

00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,670
data and it's able to detect whenever

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,369
I'm doing like like the double tab or a

00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:38,190
fist or waving in or spreading my

00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:39,870
fingers

00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:42,000
and we thought it would be pretty cool

00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:44,670
based on the theme of the conference of

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,940
ready player one and we're just going to

00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:50,760
be using this device to be sending some

00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,860
events to our Twitty scene yeah where

00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,520
we'll be sending pulses to every single

00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,860
one of you

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,870
yeah so getting started with a device

00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,970
like this is actually pretty simple we

00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:03,210
just need to import it from the mile

00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:05,190
library and we connect to it we give an

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,470
application name that you can choose and

00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:10,830
ultimately we just listen in to events

00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:12,600
right because it's all about events so

00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:15,540
the events I'm going to be using today

00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:18,270
are going to be pretty much just waving

00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,430
in to change some of the colors of the

00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:22,770
blasts and then just pretty my fingers

00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:24,870
to just just throw in a blast so you're

00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:26,760
just going like a magician swipe to the

00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:28,170
blast and just throw them in the oh yeah

00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,060
it's gonna look super silly but it's

00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:32,400
gonna be fun so let's just do it

00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,950
that's all I like it's all about fun

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,810
yeah so one of the things that I want to

00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:41,220
do first is just create and a frame box

00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:42,450
this book is just an indicator of where

00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,280
the blasts are gonna be coming from

00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:46,620
right and we're going to add some

00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,930
position and this is gonna be pretty

00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:51,720
much just in the center of the screen so

00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:53,220
I'm gonna give it zero five zero so very

00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,690
high so everybody can see it

00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:57,750
yeah and then I'm gonna give you some

00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:59,220
radius of about half of it and then

00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,570
ultimately I want to bind a component

00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,060
which is a fireball which is where

00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,470
you're going to be seen as the blast and

00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:10,920
that is going to be pretty much and

00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:13,920
attributes fireball and then I am going

00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:17,130
to like you read it before I'm gonna

00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,590
pipe it as a frame I do this before so I

00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:21,090
don't forget and it's gonna be an object

00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,800
you learn from my mistakes

00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:24,600
oh we all learned for our own mistakes

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,300
so we're going to have a color here and

00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,370
that color is going to be the result of

00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:33,780
a observable that I'm gonna call the

00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:36,270
blast color observe oh yeah sure color

00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,340
so basically this fireball is just

00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:40,290
another iframe extension they are called

00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:42,600
a frame components in order to confuse

00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:44,130
us with angular components but they are

00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,800
more like directives in angular

00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:50,310
remember filter filter filter filter yep

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,540
so same here and you can install it from

00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:54,150
ATM and

00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:56,250
that's a cool fire effect to your

00:41:54,150 --> 00:42:00,180
objects as we are going to see now it's

00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:02,130
like animated generated texture and what

00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,680
did you just do why did you delete my

00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:07,620
code I worked hard to get it I know I do

00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,520
this sometimes by with - oops so okay I

00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,020
want to do two things

00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,310
I want to get a blast color that I'm

00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,410
going to be getting from a blast service

00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:15,870
and I'm gonna give my actual collection

00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:17,880
of blasts over time so let's do a lot of

00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:19,950
color use whenever you swipe and blast

00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,750
is whenever you throw a ball right yeah

00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:24,690
so pretty much I'm gonna use my service

00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:26,160
and these service rates the data from my

00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,720
firebase right yeah this is all

00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,580
committed to firebase and I have an

00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,440
application separately in my computer we

00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,750
do it there when you will be master of

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:38,880
the ceremonies yeah dependency injection

00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:44,040
and inject our last service which is

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:49,200
going to come from our last service then

00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:53,180
we will be able to access it and we'll

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:55,770
be able to just do get the blasted color

00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:58,260
similarly we're just going to do a

00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:00,330
collection of blasts and this is also

00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:03,210
going to be an observable coming from

00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:06,720
our last service this is all about last

00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:11,780
night service I'm having a blast

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,780
yeah and I'm gonna get a blast

00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,170
something to take into consideration is

00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:19,790
that our service is going to be

00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:22,440
returning a collection of blasts from

00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:23,910
firebase so I'm just blowing the

00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,860
functions that I have that they're going

00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:28,230
to be filtering for the right type of

00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:31,080
gesture and they're going to be applying

00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:35,010
the right color so I think with this ask

00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:38,130
me to save this one here actually let me

00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:45,960
go to our HTML because I need to add the

00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:47,670
actual laughs so you're cheating I just

00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,930
can't and I know what happened here I

00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:52,530
just type that super fast

00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:54,660
I like your research that's what happens

00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:57,630
when you do it solo

00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:00,480
this next sleeper that I interacted it's

00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:02,370
very much a entity of the sphere and

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,790
we're going to be using it and before

00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:05,710
iterating over our

00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:09,700
terrible blasts so whenever an

00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:11,770
observable is added to our collection

00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:14,530
it's going to iterate going to added

00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:16,360
fear yeah I'm learning before and it's

00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:19,210
going to add some basic animations of

00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,460
just like giggling to make it bigger so

00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:23,460
we should be seeing the sphere blowing

00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:26,170
from the center of the square and

00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:29,350
ultimately is going to throw a c'mon

00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:30,790
sound that we prepared probably we don't

00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:32,950
have the sounds I'm just gonna remove it

00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:34,690
right yeah it will be nicer we won't

00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:36,670
have everybody's phones playing the

00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:38,710
random sounds yeah why do you throw the

00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,390
but I can do the effect I can do oh

00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:43,150
you'll do it yourself

00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:44,620
yeah I can try and ultimate as you can

00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,570
see here we have the attribute fireball

00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:50,470
that we before so our blasts had the

00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:53,140
same color of your bus and if you see a

00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:57,030
wire right let's try to save it and

00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:57,030
let's show them your blast

00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:04,110
[Music]

00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:08,680
I have it right here

00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:10,120
probably yeah it's in my local host oh

00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,690
you still need to connect it with your

00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,130
Emil

00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:13,900
it's right here actually to the

00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:16,120
vibrating because when it connects I can

00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:18,130
feel a my arm so this this would do it

00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,290
here but you want to open the preview

00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:22,870
here so we can see the blast yes and I

00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:24,610
will show them what you are doing while

00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:26,140
you're blasting all right this is assume

00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:30,130
you know my computer there is do a

00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:32,590
command + yes is it working

00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:35,740
yeah so if I go fist first of all let me

00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:38,110
find the center were okay so this is

00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:39,580
this fireball element that you put these

00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,470
folks that you put in the center right

00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,910
yeah and there is somebody floating is

00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:45,100
like jumping and working at the same

00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:47,590
time I'm going to jump - all right cool

00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:49,510
so how do we change colors you guys

00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:52,990
remember what gesture do we do to change

00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:57,700
the colors there you go yeah so so can

00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:59,530
you swipe if I swipe it doesn't wait it

00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:02,470
actually might be you need to calibrate

00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:03,820
it do something I get let's see there is

00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:05,880
something happened there you go your

00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:09,610
screen if I do it again

00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:11,410
wrong changes lime green does it work

00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:14,290
for you as well can you guys see the

00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:15,819
color change and that's coming directly

00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:18,909
for my muscles

00:46:15,819 --> 00:46:21,099
which is pretty cool Wow right these

00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:22,899
muscles right you just into blood yeah

00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:27,599
so I'm just gonna swipe two different

00:46:22,899 --> 00:46:29,380
colors until I found one that I like I

00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,149
like this one actually

00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:33,399
no one more because it's a little dark

00:46:31,149 --> 00:46:35,559
oh there you go that's the last and then

00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:39,459
if I do the face and then I do the blast

00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:41,529
we should start seeing some blast so you

00:46:39,459 --> 00:46:43,779
are sending blast to everybody here yeah

00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:47,459
let's let's actually I think we can put

00:46:43,779 --> 00:46:53,979
it full screen now yeah let's try that

00:46:47,459 --> 00:46:55,839
yep table kill my GPU you know what we

00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:59,669
still have like five more minutes I will

00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:02,409
add another wizard where let's make this

00:46:59,669 --> 00:47:06,669
wow this is going to kill the GPU but

00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:10,359
invaders are animated right yes so let's

00:47:06,669 --> 00:47:12,549
add some animation to our invaders so

00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:14,889
since we want you to do some more

00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:17,169
homework we're not going to go over how

00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:19,869
we do it you will have to look at it at

00:47:17,169 --> 00:47:22,839
home or if you are really fast readers

00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:27,039
you will be able to see that I am

00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:31,929
creating a new observable it's any funny

00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:34,449
thing yes I'm creating a new observable

00:47:31,929 --> 00:47:36,669
that emits true and false every half a

00:47:34,449 --> 00:47:40,269
second and then I'm going to use this

00:47:36,669 --> 00:47:45,909
observable to switch between two models

00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:49,029
of invaders so that would be I need to I

00:47:45,909 --> 00:47:52,859
think you see I'm not lying about my

00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:55,539
abilities I'm just running there yeah

00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:57,519
and then the last thing we are going to

00:47:55,539 --> 00:48:00,939
do we are actually going to change our

00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:03,729
object idle so instead of being loading

00:48:00,939 --> 00:48:07,209
the model directly here

00:48:03,729 --> 00:48:10,929
right I'm going to use to change this to

00:48:07,209 --> 00:48:16,940
be and maybe I will better close this

00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:21,930
window so if the browser that

00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:26,010
I'll close the other clubs first so who

00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:29,370
killed my brother any day refresh what

00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:31,500
do you say oh you just worked perfect so

00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:33,270
we were here and we wanted

00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,980
while this music is really putting me

00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:37,350
right it's like getting in the zone huh

00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,810
yeah I'm in the zone let's make this an

00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:42,810
entity so we can put the different

00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:46,260
utilities models inside we are doing it

00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:49,550
for performance reasons and then inside

00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:55,680
it we are going to put two different

00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:59,040
versions of the invader one of them will

00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:01,110
be with the first model object the

00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:04,290
second one will be with the second model

00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:07,530
object in Veda 1 0 and 1 and we are

00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:11,040
going to change the visibility according

00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:13,890
to the animation observable so they will

00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:19,010
