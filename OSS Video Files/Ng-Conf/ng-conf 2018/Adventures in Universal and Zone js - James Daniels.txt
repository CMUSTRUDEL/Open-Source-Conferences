and of course my screen goes black haha

00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:16,199
hey there everybody how's the conference

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:19,800
going having a good time so who here

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,810
uses firebase or has used firebase nice

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,810
nice how many of you use angularfire

00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:29,970
nice got some good representation so

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,969
today I'm actually going to walk through

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,960
some of the trials and tribulations I

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,790
went through in our next release where

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,950
we're actually doing a lot of stuff to

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:46,340
support server-side rendering for you so

00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,870
what I hope you get out of this talk is

00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:53,430
you know some pointers especially if

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,949
you're a package author and then getting

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,460
to realize all the things that package

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,129
authors do to abstract away these issues

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,140
so you don't have to worry about it so

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,330
for those of you that don't know about

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:14,580
firebase though let me give you a recap

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:17,490
on what we do cool logo so there's three

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,850
primary products and the firebase suite

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,580
so firebase is a suite of tools made by

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,220
Google cloud for mobile developers and

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,259
mobile web developers so the three that

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,710
really help out to angular developers

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,530
are firebase hosting this is our static

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,829
web hosting you put your files up on

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,829
there it serves them there's a CDN in

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:43,500
front of it very performant there's the

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:47,700
real time database so the real time

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,460
database is a cloud JSON store and the

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,399
cool thing about it is you attach

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,909
listeners to parts of the database so

00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,509
whenever things change all the connected

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:03,659
clients get those updates in real time

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,329
through a callback so that works really

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,390
well with the rxjs side of things and

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,550
then there's firebase authentication so

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,830
you can authenticate your users email

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,940
password phone

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:20,990
Google github Facebook all of that and

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:23,600
we've done all the work for you so we've

00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,700
built a client-side SDKs you just hook

00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,100
it up and you can authenticate your

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:31,430
users and that product is completely

00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:34,100
free we've recently had two major

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,740
additions so cloud functions for

00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,770
firebase this came out before we spoke

00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:43,160
to you last year cloud functions is our

00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:46,130
server list compute it attaches on

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,740
events on all the other fire based

00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:51,890
products so when a new user is created

00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,110
you can't rip some node.js code when

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,350
there's a write in your database you

00:02:54,110 --> 00:03:02,090
can't rip some node.js code so

00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:05,360
side-effects as a service we also

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:08,540
recently introduced the cloud fire store

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,140
beta so cloud fire store is our next

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,870
generation data store built on the

00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:18,140
concepts of the real time database but

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:21,110
also using cloud spanner and massive

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,269
horizontal scalability think of it more

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:27,019
like a traditional database and its

00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:28,370
guarantees that can just scale to

00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:29,959
infinity so you don't have to worry

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,080
about it if you haven't checked out

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,959
cloud fire store and maybe you are burnt

00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,280
by the real time database in the past

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,250
definitely check it out again it's a

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,480
very cool technology but our most

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:47,959
important launch of course is swag

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:50,870
we have firebase Sox now so now head to

00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:54,290
toe in firebase swag

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,830
we have shoe laces socks t-shirts we

00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:02,300
need some track pants and a jacket next

00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:06,440
we'll be working on that so I am one of

00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:08,959
the maintainer x' on angularfire so what

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:14,239
is angular fire so we have the firebase

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:17,739
j/s SDK this is a framework agnostic SDK

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:21,739
it's JavaScript it's based off of

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:23,750
promises and callbacks so we can do

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:27,830
better in the angular world

00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:31,130
so we have angularfire - we're still

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:33,290
working on the naming we're really what

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:37,160
we've done is we built on top of the

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:41,330
firebase j/s sdk it has observables it

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:45,290
has an NG rx friendly API now is zone GS

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:47,660
aware built on modules so you can do

00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:51,020
some lazy loading or only get the parts

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:53,510
of the Jay s SDK that you need and it

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:57,140
also now supports dependency injection

00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:00,290
in some good spots so basically it's the

00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,100
firebase GS SDK extended to work better

00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,370
for you

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:07,160
angular developers now if you've been

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,110
following angular fire some of these

00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,620
bullet points are new and that's because

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:16,070
we just shipped them so before I jump

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,570
into the depths angular universal

00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:21,200
everyone here knows what angular

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:23,870
Universal is right yeah so angular

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,100
universal is server-side rendering for

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:31,280
angular the main benefits is you get

00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,490
better performance the contents already

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:38,150
on the page it can be cached by CD ends

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:41,240
so super fast especially in the firebase

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:44,660
world like you can actually cache your

00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,180
contents behind a CDN and then the real

00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,850
time database or fire store can then

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:54,590
alter the page with those observable

00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:56,419
callbacks it's optimized for SEO and you

00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:01,580
can get site previews on things like

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:04,460
Facebook and Twitter sharing so when we

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,010
added Universal support or started to

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,900
add Universal support our ideas were

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:12,200
these four things this is what we wanted

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:16,250
to achieve is you the developer would

00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:19,610
need no changes to your code in the SDK

00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:22,190
would have no conditional branching so I

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,740
wouldn't go if it's the server do this

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,050
else do this if it's a browser do this

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,410
oh let's do that those are places where

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,330
a lot of bugs can get introduced and

00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:35,030
changes in behavior it should work out

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,860
of the box no fiddling with your web

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,009
pack and

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,930
ashin or anything like that and like I

00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:44,080
touched on no differences in behavior

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:51,009
it should same code worked the same

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:53,650
server and the client side so last year

00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:56,560
I was up on stage as an angular noob I'm

00:06:53,650 --> 00:07:00,969
still an angular noob you know just work

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:04,240
on a library us all so I came up here

00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:08,169
and I told you you know in the next 6 to

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,990
12 months well we wanted to achieve with

00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:14,020
angular fire and one of them was

00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:16,719
Universal support and I'm kind of

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,110
feeling this picture right now you know

00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:24,939
it's only been one year not eight years

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:27,270
but man I identify with that so I'm

00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:29,919
going to walk you through some of the

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:35,800
tribulations of missteps that we had and

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:42,550
all the fun in 3x act 1 packaging make

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:45,039
sure that's an order so your package and

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:48,129
of course all of your upstream

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,560
dependencies should work with

00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:54,219
server-side rendering right it should be

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,050
able to support node on the server there

00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:59,520
shouldn't be those things that I had

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:02,440
touched on where behavior if this else

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,990
lot you want everything to act the same

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:09,370
regardless of its on the browser or the

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:11,500
server side for the server any of the

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,139
dependencies you need or any of the

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,729
polyfills should be President should

00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:18,419
come with the package it should be in

00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:21,370
the package JSON and defined and

00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:24,129
optimally taken care of and it shouldn't

00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:28,120
require you fiddle with your web pack

00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:30,830
config to get things working none of

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,760
that was the case with anything

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:37,519
the firebase GS SDK was in the middle of

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,680
a packaging rewrite and it was a biggie

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,740
mess you had to go into your web pack

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,660
config and say entry point index dot

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:50,570
node and generally a big mess

00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:54,350
however we filed some bugs on bug and

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:56,240
Iser lots and lots of bugs and those

00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,730
eventually got fixed

00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,310
there was a packaging rewrite so as

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,320
those upstreams were fixed things

00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,899
started getting better for us though

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,230
today we still have to pull in those

00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:12,190
polyfills namely pulling in WebSockets

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:16,000
and xml httprequest

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:18,950
there's some work going on eventually

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,050
where the SDKs will handle that better

00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:26,420
and pull in things like fetch so today

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:30,310
we now have this and if you pull those

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:34,310
in you get part of the way towards

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:40,720
server-side support that brings me to

00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:43,850
the X next act which is window so as

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,750
you're aware and the server window

00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,290
doesn't exist

00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,040
so once the packaging problems were

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,050
taken care of

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,579
and I decided to give this problem

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:58,940
another stab I ran it and just errors

00:09:55,579 --> 00:10:03,380
everywhere on the server and it turns

00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:06,529
out I got this is kind of amped up here

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:09,290
with the column number but this is what

00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:13,579
I was seeing is can't read property

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:17,449
blehh blehh on column ninety nine

00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:19,550
million seven hundred something and what

00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:22,339
this was was actually some of the google

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:25,940
dependencies that fire store any other

00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:31,130
group firebase j s sdk dependencies were

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:35,329
using were actually the NPM package came

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:37,640
with it already minified and it was

00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:39,709
minified it didn't have source maps it

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,329
didn't have the source in there so just

00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:44,059
minified j s

00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:47,299
but came with the node module so package

00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:51,920
authors please don't do that it's pretty

00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:55,399
bad I'd go and to figure out what all of

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,579
these were errors everywhere I would try

00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:02,269
to you know clean up the source code I'd

00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:03,949
used chrome inspector to try to Diop his

00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:07,179
skate things and dent things pretty

00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:10,309
print it and chrome would just explode

00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:13,759
laptop fire shooting out it didn't work

00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:16,579
well so really gross thing here but what

00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:19,009
I actually ended up doing was jumping

00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:22,540
into the node modules folder and then

00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:25,329
pretty printing through vs code and

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,769
finding the lines and the columns and

00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:31,279
eventually I came to the conclusion that

00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:38,749
all of these were obfuscated code that

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:42,319
were referring to window dot so yeah

00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:49,999
it's really gross what did I do

00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:52,069
file moorish is that's that's my

00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:57,949
expression that is how I was feeling

00:11:52,069 --> 00:12:01,059
after all this so eventually these were

00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:03,160
fixed this is how I felt as our upstream

00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:05,449
dependencies were all cleaned up

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:10,299
supported server-side rendering better

00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:14,149
and I thought for sure that we were good

00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:17,259
so at this point we had the firebase

00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:19,489
summit and I got a Minimum Viable

00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:23,029
server-side rendering project together

00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:26,350
and I went up on stage and embarrassed

00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:28,579
myself I had a live demo ready

00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,790
everything was good I gave everyone an

00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:33,230
rxjs rundown it's going really swell and

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:39,309
then I asked the audience to participate

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:43,429
and hit the application what did I see

00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:46,369
timeouts timeouts timeouts everywhere so

00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:50,679
embarrassed myself is actually great cuz

00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:53,990
the YouTube video that was where I was

00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:54,980
immortalized the editors managed to snip

00:12:53,990 --> 00:13:00,500
out the last five

00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:03,910
of me looking like a damn fool that

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:07,250
brings me to the final act of this and

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:11,030
the one that took a lot of learning and

00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:13,520
figuring out not as many filing issues

00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:15,740
on buggin Iser but just as much banging

00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:20,300
head on keyboard which was I had to

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:24,290
learn some je s so this is what I was

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:27,800
faced with I decided to jump in and say

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:29,930
okay what was going on why worry why was

00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,350
I getting these timeouts and this is an

00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:40,310
actual depiction of the firebase GS SDKs

00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:44,290
source code timers everywhere just

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:50,030
everywhere timers callbacks things that

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:52,100
didn't have zone J s patches and last

00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,340
year I mentioned when I was up here on

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:58,100
stage as I came from the rails community

00:13:54,340 --> 00:14:01,970
member before that and I spoke about how

00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:05,420
I was very happy that angular seemed to

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:07,130
have less magic well boy was I wrong so

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:12,650
there was there's a lot of magic there

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:15,610
in zone J s so zone J s I'm sure

00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:19,840
everyone here is ran into stuff before

00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:22,580
at least in the universal context and

00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,090
serviceworkers zone J s is a good way of

00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,830
telling when things are done and ready

00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:30,800
basically it's a wraps all your

00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:33,880
concurrent things and lets you know if

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,790
there's still tasks to be executed and

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:40,610
here it's used to both tell when

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:44,420
renderings ready so your page doesn't

00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:45,830
render until the application is stable

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,570
so that's what I was running into with

00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,910
the timer is the application was named

00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,700
never stabilizing because of all those

00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:55,220
timers we knew something was up we were

00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,950
getting a lot of zone J s related issues

00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,560
filed on github and we just never jumped

00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:04,070
in there I was kind of burnt out at this

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,500
point but ng serviceworker came around

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,750
and that doesn't get registered until

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,180
your

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:15,020
application is stable so then we're like

00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:18,750
we have to deal with this so how we

00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:22,560
approach this problem was using ng zone

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:25,200
which is around zone GS and we can say

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,830
run outside of angular so what this is

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,890
going to do is anything that starts here

00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:34,350
the timer's anything like that any of

00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:37,140
these callbacks all of it will be

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:40,680
outside of angular zone angular won't

00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:44,730
care about it now what you need to do

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:49,050
though is you need zone for that change

00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:51,180
detection so we go back and run it

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:54,090
inside of angular zone in our callback

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:57,150
and then put the next value on the

00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,950
emitter we had to wrap pretty much

00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:02,030
everything and run outside of angular

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:04,260
all of the firebase Jazz SDK

00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,810
initialization because that spins up

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:11,300
timers with off like I said timers

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:13,650
everywhere so this got us pretty far but

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,390
things were rendering the browser was

00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,250
working the serviceworker was rendering

00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:22,110
but something just felt off

00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:25,350
so I looked at view source turned off

00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:28,440
JavaScript and lo and behold this is my

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:32,220
page I had nulls and undefined

00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:35,130
everywhere and as I mentioned it wasn't

00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:39,570
sewn j/s patched so what this actually

00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:43,560
was caused by was everything's a

00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:45,480
callback in firebase and I was doing

00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:50,790
everything outside of angular it's all

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:55,920
async so I need to tell angular to not

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:58,620
render the page until it's ready so

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,260
debugging this I didn't find a great

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,660
solution this is kind of what I ended up

00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,579
with which is just console logging it it

00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,310
would be in my terminal it would be in

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:15,510
my browser console at comment out code

00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:19,280
and see what fell out and I needed

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,280
someone to hold the door

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:31,440
and of course that fell on my

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:34,320
misunderstood friend zone je s so what I

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:39,390
had to do was actually start a zone

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:43,560
macro task and then subscribe to first

00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:45,720
and then finish the task and basically

00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,510
what that would do is it would make it

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,050
so that zone knew there were tasks that

00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:54,060
needed to be completed before the page

00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,850
could render and there's probably

00:17:54,060 --> 00:18:01,410
cleaner ways to do this but this worked

00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:05,870
for me and yeah got it

00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:07,110
it's rendering so this is available on

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,080
angularfire

00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:13,200
- at next still working on the naming

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,050
but you can try it out this was a very

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,960
big change so those of you that are

00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:21,090
using angularfire give this a try let us

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,950
know if you run into anything we had to

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,250
fiddle around with the observables a bit

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:29,340
so we don't want any bad behavior so

00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:33,240
give it a try now the next question

00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:35,130
state transfer haven't tackled that yet

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:43,350
maybe maybe I'll talk about that next

00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:45,990
year so in closing I'd like to say that

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,510
zone j s was was misunderstood I thought

00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:54,990
it was my enemy at first but it ended up

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:57,360
saving the day and I think eventually we

00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:00,920
can do better with this and we can make

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,920
tools to make debugging zone problems

00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:06,470
easier we can do things to make it so

00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:13,170
you don't have to jump in and

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:16,410
console.log everything and we'll see so

00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:19,530
a couple shout outs so this was a really

00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:23,070
really great blog post on helping me

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:26,610
understand what was going on in zone j s

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:29,250
is his angular in depth on medium max K

00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:31,070
and this was a really great post he

00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,539
walked through everything he kind of

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:36,419
reverse-engineered things so if you're

00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:39,749
facing any zone J s issues or realize

00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:43,799
that not knowing zone J s is limiter

00:19:39,749 --> 00:19:47,039
check this out and I also want to give a

00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:48,210
shout out to Jeff Delaney he's a new

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,700
firebase gde

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,340
and he makes this awesome series angular

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,110
firebase a lot of his courses are up on

00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,480
YouTube he has Pro stuff as well

00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,669
check it out I talked about some of the

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:04,379
trials we had he'll actually walk you

00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:05,610
through how to use angular fire to to

00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:08,820
build a server-side render to

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:11,340
application and I want to give a shout

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,169
out to David East's for being my rubber

00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,259
duck during all this I sent him

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:18,389
countless endless streams of hangouts

00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:22,049
messages while I was banging my head

00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:25,960
against the keyboard and thanked all of

00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:29,539
you for making this awesome community

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,539
