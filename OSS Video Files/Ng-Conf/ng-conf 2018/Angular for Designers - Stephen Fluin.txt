oh hi I'm back hooray we did it so my

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,880
name is Stephen flowin I'm a developer

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,759
advocate on the angular team at Google

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,950
so earlier today you saw awesome things

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,900
about being productive about being

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,070
practical real advice that you can go

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,020
home and act on this talk is not that

00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:24,420
okay so there's two warnings so first

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,670
all of this is kind of it more at the

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,380
early ideation phase right this is not

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,179
real products these are not things

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,630
you're gonna go home open up vs code and

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:36,329
start typing second I'm gonna not use

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,820
very precise language and that's

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,649
intentional because we want to really

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,210
figure out what these things mean to

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,860
other people and not just us and so

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,110
today I want to introduce the idea of

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,820
angular for designers and so I think

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,649
first off it's really important to start

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,030
talking a little bit about maybe a

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,559
definition of designer so I'm not gonna

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,930
be very specific here just like I said

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,120
so I'm gonna when I talk about designers

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,250
I'm focusing more on individuals who are

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,469
more on the user interface and user

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,390
experience side of things and so a lot

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,769
of designers define themselves in

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,170
different ways some people are UX

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,060
engineers some people within Photoshop

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,710
all day some people live in creative

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,990
express there's lots and lots of tools

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,280
lots of different workflows and I don't

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,990
want to single out any of those

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,130
individual workflows because a lot of

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,930
these individuals and a lot of the

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,640
people in the room are very

00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,500
multi-talented and so you might have a

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,689
developer who's also a designer so

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,799
please forgive the imprecise language

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,930
that I'm gonna use to try and introduce

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,960
these topics we want to hear what people

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,390
think and what people say and then we'll

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,240
kind of refine these things over time so

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,130
my goals today are twofold first we want

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,350
to share that we care about designers

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,509
this is something that I think needs to

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,630
be said because if you don't say it

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,040
nobody knows and so second I really want

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,170
to start a conversation and so I'm gonna

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,369
throw out a few kind of initial ideas

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,460
and some of the things that we've been

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,649
working on but then I really do have a

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,750
success criteria for this talk of people

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,979
sending us messages letting us know what

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,810
they think letting us know what tools

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,490
they're working on and so at the end

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,740
definitely definitely definitely reach

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,570
out to me so I'm gonna go through this

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,860
in four sections first I want to

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,739
acknowledge some of the legacy that

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,540
exists in terms of angular

00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:12,800
and angularjs for designers and I'll

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,989
talk a little bit about the challenges

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,940
that they face and the challenges that

00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:18,620
we face today then I want to go into

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,959
some of the initial goals that we have

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,209
set out for this initiative of angular

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,830
for designers and then I'm gonna go into

00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,500
a few of these initiatives and say hey

00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,849
wouldn't it be cool if X existed and

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,980
then those are things that we want your

00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:32,269
feedback on and then last I'll give you

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,239
some specific instructions for getting

00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:36,920
involved so let's get started so I first

00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,890
want to acknowledge some of the legacy

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,290
so many of us come from an angularjs

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,569
background not all of us but many of us

00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:47,360
did and there is kind of a magic in the

00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:49,610
angularjs world where you could just

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,049
start changing applications very quickly

00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,569
and it made it really great for

00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:55,760
prototyping additionally when we look at

00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:57,709
the current workflow between designers

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,540
and developers and larger teams there's

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,069
a handoff of these interactive

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,690
prototypes of these things that we're

00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:04,579
building using sketch using all these

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,099
other great tools that we want to look

00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:08,769
at and really explore a little bit more

00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:10,970
and then lastly there one of the

00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:12,829
challenges that we face is gaining

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,420
adoption of our design systems and so we

00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:16,519
talked earlier about how everyone kind

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,989
of needs one everyone has one but it's

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:19,940
still it's sometimes a challenge in

00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:21,350
terms of getting people to design it or

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,380
developers to build things in the right

00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,000
way that the design system intended so I

00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,250
talked a little bit about the magic of

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,799
angularjs and I kind of always come back

00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,660
to this angularjs.org home page so how

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,130
many people here their first exposure in

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,720
your jeaious was this page and you're

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,870
like you type something in the box and

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,690
it just showed up magically right that

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,220
was really cool in particular because I

00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,859
was taking things that I already knew

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,590
HTML and I was making small kind of

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:50,239
microscopic changes to that HTML and it

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,190
was manifesting as behaviors who was

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,620
manifesting itself as functionality

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,060
which then I could then use to show

00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,220
someone I could show a concept I could

00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,540
say hey what if it did this and that was

00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,829
something that was really helpful for

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,680
designers that were building out

00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:05,780
prototypes and so forth those designers

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,549
that do know HTML and you're jeaious was

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,840
really exciting for this prototyping use

00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:10,280
case because you get a dashes of

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,660
interactivity throughout your

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,299
application throughout your kind of

00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,039
static mock-up in some ways but we've

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:18,799
actually made this much harder today so

00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:20,659
in terms of if we compare angularjs and

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,039
angular angular is much better at

00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:23,210
helping you build a scale the

00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:25,250
maintainable application

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,440
in the right way that's gonna continue

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:30,169
to grow and work well for you and

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,270
deliver great user experiences but along

00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,910
with that came a lot of tooling I have

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,560
to install node wait that this might

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,350
sound easy to some of us for a lot of

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,850
people installing note is actually

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,490
non-trivial right like some people go

00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,500
through nvm some people install it bare

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,360
some people execute curl scripts that

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,470
execute arbitrary in code off the

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,080
internet which is a little dangerous

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,210
maybe don't do that

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,130
some people like sometimes like it

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,150
didn't used to but now NPM comes with

00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,190
node but what if you're in a

00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,630
jurisdiction where for example you need

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,759
to use an alternative you have to use

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,169
something that's maybe NPM block for you

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,789
and you have to do something like C NPM

00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,740
that's a challenge that you have to then

00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:07,849
overcome then we have all the tooling

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,139
that we have for sharing and

00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,120
collaborating as developers right so a

00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:12,590
lot of us really love get-get is very

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,360
very powerful in terms of the way that

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,090
it can help you understand and merge

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,460
changes to source code it's not as well

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,610
designed for merging Colet creative

00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,500
things like PS DS right then there's a

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,849
newer CLI it's really powerful it's

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,680
really awesome and I think a lot of us

00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:29,210
in the room are gonna continue using it

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,370
to achieve these really great outcomes

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,870
and save ourselves a lot of time but for

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,070
a designer this is another tool that

00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,479
they have to go learn that they might

00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,120
not already have in their toolbox they

00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:39,800
might not want in their toolbox

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,360
typescript is another example so a lot

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,770
of people when they hear about angular

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,510
and typescript and how we use it in all

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,159
of our examples they think oh I have to

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,229
go learn another language right we all

00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:50,180
know that it's not another language but

00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:52,250
this is yet another barrier and then

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,229
lastly if you look at the experience of

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,030
creating a new project so if I run ng

00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,710
new I'm gonna get a very scalable

00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,840
maintainable project with things like

00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,550
tests and unit tests and then which are

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,960
good for developers but they actually

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,759
get in the way if I'm trying to just

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,099
prototype something out or move quickly

00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:08,750
in terms of just manifesting an

00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:11,270
experience that's not actually gonna be

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,580
used in production there's a really

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,870
common team pattern where we'll see that

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,060
designers they build something they

00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,919
build either a specification file or an

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,900
interactive prototype and then they hand

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:23,360
that off to a developer right it's a

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,820
one-time handoff or it starts that way

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,080
but then very very quickly there's one

00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,940
to do revisions we need to collaborate

00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,490
how many people have seen something like

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,639
profile screen three final two final

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:38,899
final super final right

00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:40,279
this is get four designers and so this

00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,300
is one of the kind of big challenges as

00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,729
we think about how do we collaborate

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,699
better because we've got these multiple

00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:48,740
sources of truth we also hear from a lot

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,080
of times my design was perfect and then

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,279
the developers they ruined it how could

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,349
they they didn't understand what I was

00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,789
trying to create and they they kept

00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:57,020
doing this thing called reality right

00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:58,639
like oh that the platform doesn't

00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,139
support that but that's not what users

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,080
need right the users need experiences

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:04,339
they don't need technology and so I want

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,379
to talk a little bit about some of the

00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,719
goals of this initiative angular for

00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:10,729
designers so first I think we should

00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:14,180
spend a lot of time focusing on making

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:16,039
angular useful for designers so just

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,419
first focusing on those that know HTML

00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:19,129
and CSS so if you think back to the

00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:21,259
angularjs use case of why that was so

00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:24,289
exciting and why I think it brought so

00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:26,389
many kind of web designers into the

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:27,830
world of angular and angular j/s it was

00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:30,979
because it was so easy to get started

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,270
and so that's one of the goals and we

00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:34,669
also want to kind of create some of the

00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,719
magic because there is a degree of magic

00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:40,699
when you can just start adding

00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:42,019
sprinkling in that functionality second

00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,729
we want to create more collaborative

00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:45,979
teams and so I talked about this handoff

00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,969
that it's really a big challenge and so

00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:49,550
one of the things we think a lot about

00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:51,080
we spent a lot of time talking about is

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,669
this idea of could there be a single

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,949
source of truth that exists between

00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:56,240
designers and developers so that when

00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:58,159
they make modifications whether it's

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,809
from the coding standpoint or from the

00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:02,029
design standpoint if we're modifying the

00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:03,919
same document that's gonna be helpful

00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:05,659
and so if we really want to bridge the

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,349
gaps between these roles in terms of

00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:11,419
skill sets in terms of access to tooling

00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:13,639
and so we if we reanalyze this picture

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:15,259
instead of having a designer that hands

00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,949
off to a developer what if they're

00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:20,419
working together in a single document

00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:23,629
third I want to think about empowering

00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:25,099
design system authors so if you have a

00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,719
design system in use it's a

00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,309
manifestation of your brand which is

00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:30,019
really important every time you have a

00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:32,209
product team go off and build something

00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:33,769
that doesn't look like your standards

00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:35,000
your brand is actually gonna be

00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:36,740
suffering a little bit right it's gonna

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,419
not feel as cohesive customers will not

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,969
have the same positive associations with

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,620
the brand and so that that's actually

00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:45,829
one of the goals is how do we empower

00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,270
these design system authors to then

00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:50,570
engage developers and

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,830
effectively forth really making it

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,260
easier to build these great experiences

00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,940
and so if you're from the development

00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,320
standpoint if we can make it easy for

00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,840
you to be building these things out

00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,490
faster and give you best practices for

00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,750
it from a design standpoint not just a

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,210
development standpoint out of the box

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,850
again you're gonna be manifesting better

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:10,540
experiences for your users and so now I

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:13,070
want to dive into a set of initiatives

00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,970
where we've been doing a lot of thinking

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,830
about this we've been having several

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,390
kind of early conversations and so

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,380
there's several directions this can go

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,480
and I want to explore these

00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,760
collaboratively with you so this is

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,010
disclaimer many many of these efforts

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,390
are not real if you see something and

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,600
you're like oh that's cool I can't wait

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,620
till that comes out you have to tell us

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,000
otherwise we won't know that we need to

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,980
go build these things or have the

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,110
community building so these are not

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,700
promises does everyone agree then that

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:42,740
promises all right good

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:45,020
all right so making you are useful for

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,510
designers what if we had less developer

00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,890
tooling needed in order to get in and

00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,700
make a change to an existing in your

00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,860
application

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,420
so I want to highlight stack blitz here

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,270
as something that's already exists today

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,890
that actually facilitates this so if I'm

00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,840
a designer I know a little bit of HTML

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,550
and I want to get in and modify it in

00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,470
your application stack let's is kind of

00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,720
amazing right I can pull up a single URL

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,700
that corresponds to our github page I

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,530
don't need to install command line I

00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,640
don't need install node I don't need NPM

00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,460
I don't even need to learn the in your

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,290
CLI I just pull up a URL and I can look

00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,660
at an HTML file start making changes and

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,000
immediately see exactly how that's going

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,860
to manifest itself on the page and so

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,900
this is kind of that magic comes in is

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,430
how do we have a single source of truth

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,110
and if that source of truth could be the

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,560
application that's that's actually a

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:32,090
pretty big win so this is something that

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,830
does not exist but something that I have

00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:37,010
talked about a little bit before I call

00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:38,990
it a ng exe just for the idea that this

00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,280
is a binary that we could theoretically

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,810
put on your machine or you could

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,450
download from the internet where we

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,730
statically link NPM we statically linked

00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:48,230
node and give you the ability to start

00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,960
getting up and running with angular and

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,280
the angular CLI much quicker right if

00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,320
you didn't have to install those extra

00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,210
steps I think this would be a really

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,470
powerful thing because then I don't have

00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,550
to go and learn all that extra tooling

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,080
and deal with versions and all these

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,070
things we can just trust the angular

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,240
team theoretically

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:07,220
to be providing these things for us so

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,840
again in in making angular useful for

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,080
designers what if we had some more

00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,270
ergonomic file formats so imagine a

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,220
simpler components and so I was actually

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,320
really surprised by this when I started

00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,790
digging into this initiative because I

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,130
was talking to designer after designer

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,020
and they were saying this this idea that

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,850
you're you have a type script file you

00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,800
have an HTML file and a CSS file

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,140
separate and then a spec file is that

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,550
they're typically using the CLI that can

00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,070
actually be somewhat confusing for them

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:36,380
if they could have all of these things

00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,450
in a single file that that's actually a

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,370
preference write it from a development

00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,690
standpoint it's technically the same

00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,700
right whether you have three files or

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,470
one but even just this having this

00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,570
slight subtle change of being able to

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,830
specify all three of these pieces in a

00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,380
single file would actually make a huge

00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:54,100
deal not only to the perception but to

00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:57,200
also do the productivity of designers

00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:00,020
one of the examples I was given of this

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,910
is in angular if you want to copy a

00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,220
component what do you do right you take

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,870
the file and the other file and the

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,330
other file and you copy them all and

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,410
then you have to go and add the new you

00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,470
have to rename everything and then you

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:14,030
add the new reference in your nu module

00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,650
that that doesn't necessarily match what

00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,940
people are expecting out-of-the-box

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,080
in order to create a new component right

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,790
they're used to saying hey I've got one

00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,100
thing make copy of it now I've got two

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,070
and it doesn't quite match that and so

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,620
if we had this idea of a single

00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:29,180
component in a single HTML file that

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,530
that would really better match a lot of

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:34,640
those expectations and meet those needs

00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:36,680
I want you to now imagine a new ng add

00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,300
command so if we talked a little bit

00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,610
about ng add in the first keynote where

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:43,460
this is really adding capabilities to an

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,630
application but what if by adding those

00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,610
capabilities you need to remove

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,470
something from the project and so what

00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,210
if you UNG knew it a new project and

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,250
then you could ng add adding your such

00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,650
prototype so that would theoretically

00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,300
set up an angular CLI project and then

00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:59,780
remove all of the things that designers

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,730
don't care about so things like tests I

00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,860
know right this is a little

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:05,300
contradictory with this morning but when

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,670
you're building for a specific purpose

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,480
which is manifesting and evaluating a

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,010
design or an experience trying to also

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,180
have it be production code at the same

00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,250
time can be a chance

00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,269
one of the things that we do a lot at

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,949
Google and we've heard from a lot of

00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:21,170
other companies that they do is people

00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:23,449
build prototypes not to help even

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,160
developers but to validate an idea right

00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:26,839
this is a product management effort in a

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,420
lot of ways where I want to take this

00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,769
prototype that feels like an experience

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,360
and I want to put that in front of our

00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:35,029
users and we want to do research and we

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,040
want to evaluate how do people react to

00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:40,029
this experience and for those sorts of

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,529
experiences tests are less important I

00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:45,709
also want to imagine an angular IO where

00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:47,060
it's angular io / design so all of the

00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:49,009
getting started content all of the

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,079
content all the way across angular io is

00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:52,370
really focused on developers we have the

00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,259
expectation you're gonna go learn node

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,180
you're gonna go learn JavaScript you're

00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:57,560
gonna have all this common understanding

00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,079
that a lot of developers in and your

00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,600
have today but we could rearrange that

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,420
we could have a specific section focused

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,250
on hey what do I need to get my job done

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,220
my job of focusing on prototyping

00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:12,079
focusing on building out experiences in

00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,459
a way that really just applies to me so

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,949
what are the best practices that should

00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:17,899
exist for designers how do I get started

00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:20,750
right is tour of Heroes the best way for

00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:22,399
a designer it gets started maybe not and

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,720
then really focusing in the instructions

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,839
on the things that these people care

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,839
about

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:31,069
so the second goal that we had was

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,839
creating more collaborative teams and

00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:35,750
one of the ways that we think about this

00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:37,699
was is giving prototypers access to real

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,939
functionality and there's several ways

00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:42,649
that we can look at doing that one of

00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:45,290
them is actually already out in kind of

00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:46,579
the wild so if anybody uses sketch or a

00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:48,319
lot of design it's a tool used by a lot

00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:50,720
of designers using a tool called

00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,160
storybook you can actually load they

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,680
have a plugin where you can load real

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,180
components in sketch and so this is

00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,889
actually a really cool idea that I think

00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,569
would be very powerful because if you

00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:01,130
don't do this if you have two sources of

00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:02,360
truth where for example you're building

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,220
out a component library and then you're

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,470
also building out a corresponding set of

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,990
sketch components you you have this

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,430
slightly uncanny valley where the sketch

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,079
components have to be maintained in

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,420
isolation from the components in your

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,589
application and if they differ that that

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,420
creates problems it creates different

00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:20,750
expectations between the designers and

00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:22,579
the developers and there's a tool that

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,589
we've actually been using in Google that

00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:27,100
it's being built out right now that

00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:28,420
we're planning on externalizing it

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,520
some point in the future I won't even

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,110
try and put a date on it but we it

00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,660
internally it's called cloudkit today

00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:37,300
and so it's a cloud-based prototyping

00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,340
tool that uses real components and so

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,250
the idea is that you can create visually

00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:45,490
here a set of components on a screen in

00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,990
a hierarchy and then you can apply all

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,910
of the rules and kind of have the rails

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,800
from that component hierarchy in that

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,300
component library so that designers

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,250
can't do things that can't happen in the

00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,570
real world and then they can create and

00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,340
share these experiences you can use it

00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:00,280
for UX research and all of the

00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,630
experiences are real components running

00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,240
in the browser being bootstrapped at

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,950
runtime the other really magical thing

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,860
about this is that all of these things

00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:11,260
can be backed up to buy real data so

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,270
imagine if when you're showing a grid

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,620
you could hook that up to a Google

00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,660
spreadsheet or you could hook that up to

00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,370
some sort of data source that helps you

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,320
visualize this content without asking to

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,520
go and build it all out so all these

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,140
things are really useful not only for

00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,060
designers but as I mentioned product

00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,290
managers where hey maybe I want to

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,610
create an interface and start a

00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,830
conversation about a feature that we

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,810
could offer right having a cloud-based

00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,150
prototyping tool that gives you real

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,010
components and real experiences would be

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,780
very very powerful and so this is

00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,730
something we're working on right now

00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,430
working with a separate team within the

00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,690
Google cloud platform team to try and

00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,410
make sure that that's externalized and

00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,940
available for all developers and one of

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,500
the the pieces of that is really

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:54,460
simplifying the process for designers to

00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:56,410
contribute so designers really benefit

00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,820
from this idea of angular's advancements

00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,740
so I talked about how a lot of these

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,710
things like node can be very difficult

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,790
to get started with but if we can make

00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,470
all those things simpler if we make

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,990
angular simpler designers are gonna

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,180
benefit from that as well there's also a

00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,530
very cool app out there that it's really

00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,870
just getting started called page straw

00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,030
and they have a bit of a controversial

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,710
opinion about hey what if designers

00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,990
we're building dumb presentational

00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,940
components purely in a visual editor and

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,010
then we manifest those as angular

00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:27,670
components that developers can then hook

00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:29,170
up events state and then consume right

00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,330
so all the developer has to worry about

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,190
is let me wire up the data let me handle

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,480
all the events and then the designer can

00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,779
focus on building out the dumb

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,519
presentational components

00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:39,799
that really create the screen and so

00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,059
they have this exist today you can try

00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,799
them out so you can create from

00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:45,019
artboards which correspond to components

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,269
there's reusable components you can nest

00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:48,979
them there's even things like state you

00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:51,080
can bind to variables that are coming in

00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:53,210
as inputs to your components and very

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,159
recently they launched in kind of a beta

00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:58,429
form some of their initial angular

00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:00,590
support so number three was about really

00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:02,149
empowering design system authors and so

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,889
there's a really cool tool out there

00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:06,379
called combo doc how many people have

00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:09,349
heard of combo doc awesome so what it

00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:11,029
does is it creates a demo site a

00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:13,339
documentation and demo site of a

00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:15,049
component library based on j/s doc

00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:16,580
annotations and so one of the things

00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:18,469
we've been exploring with the the folks

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,479
on the cloud kit team is what if we

00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:23,299
could repurpose those same annotations

00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:25,940
and make any component library loadable

00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:27,469
into that cloud prototyping tool so you

00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,299
add one set of additional metadata

00:18:27,469 --> 00:18:31,519
that's useful for users of your design

00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:32,869
system and then we also beget to be able

00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,879
to take advantage of that as part of the

00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:38,089
prototyping process and so we think this

00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,469
idea of a defined set of metadata that

00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:41,239
everyone can start adding to their

00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:43,070
components is going to really kind of

00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:46,460
help these secondary users of all these

00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:48,889
component libraries I also want explore

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,259
the idea of just the things that we have

00:18:48,889 --> 00:18:53,299
today in terms of adding material design

00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:55,729
to your application by ng add and

00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,799
generate write if every component

00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:59,929
library out there adds their component

00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,969
library f ing add that makes it much

00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:03,710
much easier for developers to opt in and

00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:05,239
take advantage of these things which we

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,830
think will be really really powerful in

00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:10,059
terms of increasing adherence to these

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:13,279
design systems as long as it's easy

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:14,929
so we're also really focused on making

00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,279
it easier to build great experiences so

00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:17,389
we've heard about IV you've heard about

00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,830
to see a lot you've heard about stack

00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,200
blitz but there's actually things that

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,940
the angular team has done for ourselves

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,499
that we feel like helps it make it a

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,379
much more collaborative process and so

00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:29,509
every PR in the angular angular repo

00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:30,830
that is originated by Anna your team

00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:33,200
member or touch finding your team member

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:35,239
can basically get this preview so it's

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,830
bot called mary poppins and what happens

00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:40,070
is we actually spin up a fully

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,989
functional version of our site based on

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,700
the DPR before it's merged before

00:19:41,989 --> 00:19:45,499
anyone's taken a look at that and the

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,789
power there is imagine if your designers

00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:49,020
could say hey I want to make this change

00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:50,640
they could get out a fully rendered

00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,860
version and understand what that impact

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,390
would have on the real application and

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,980
so this is about removing those barriers

00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:57,180
in the handoffs if we can all

00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,880
collaborate better in the single

00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,960
environment so I want to end with a

00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,440
little bit of information about how to

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:08,010
get involved this is pretty easy I'm on

00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,050
twitter at stephen fluent ste phe NF L

00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,220
you I am and I definitely hope to hear

00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,390
from a lot of you because this is

00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,290
something that we care about this is

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,600
something we're going to be investing

00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:17,160
time in and the more input you give us

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,890
in terms of what you need and what you

00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,050
care about the more aligned our efforts

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,460
are going to be to your needs we're also

00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,930
looking for community contributions

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,580
because I think one of the things that's

00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,710
amazing about angular is we have such a

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,970
great community so a lot of us are

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,680
already working and collaborating with

00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,330
designers and so if you have patterns

00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,370
you have tools that are making this

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,870
process better for you I'd love to take

00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,420
a look at those and possibly help share

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:45,099
those with the world thank you so much

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:45,099
