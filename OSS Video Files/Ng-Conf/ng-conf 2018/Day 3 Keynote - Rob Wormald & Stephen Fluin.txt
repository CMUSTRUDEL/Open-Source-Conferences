[Applause]

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:12,759
I think they forgot about me Stephen I

00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:15,230
think they did Wow

00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,370
okay we'll get through it

00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,370
[Music]

00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:28,310
[Applause]

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,630
you may have seen a couple scenes that

00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,239
looked a little bit like this one of us

00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,830
being asked question after question

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,989
answering whatever comes to your minds

00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,550
in order to say hey how can we advance

00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:49,629
in your community and I think this is

00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,309
actually one of our favorite parts about

00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:53,230
ng-conf we call it the hallway tract

00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:55,239
right where it's we actually get to have

00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,500
engaging conversations we get to hear

00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:57,910
what people care about we get to hear

00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,990
about what people love what they're

00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,640
passionate about what the challenges

00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,530
they're facing are and this is really

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,150
something that we are super passionate

00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,440
about what Steven really means is that

00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:09,790
this is the one week a year we actually

00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,050
have to do real work but I was thinking

00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,910
about this this thing that we've been

00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,979
doing where we meet with small groups we

00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:18,070
meet one-on-one and I started doing some

00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:20,800
math so if we have about 1,500 attendees

00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,590
here in person we've got about 11,000

00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,610
that have been watching the livestream

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,500
we're gonna get into some more math here

00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,910
so Angie comes about three days and I

00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,640
don't think either of us sleep very much

00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,470
so we'll just call it 72 hours so 72

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,049
hours four thousand three hundred twenty

00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,890
minutes stay with me

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,360
four thousand three hundred twenty

00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,520
minutes twelve thousand five hundred

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,310
attendees that's point three four six

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,440
minutes apiece so every one of you

00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:48,850
one-on-one gets twenty point seven

00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:52,060
seconds so I did the math trust me it's

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:55,060
okay I haven't borrowed a calculator so

00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:59,350
who wants to go first all right whoa

00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,670
whoa whoa whoa remember our day one at

00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,710
Google right what's the first thing you

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,890
tell us a Google scaleability have to do

00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,390
scalable things and I don't know as much

00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,549
as I'd love to speak to everybody in

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,190
this room for 20 seconds I don't refer

00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:13,750
to be able to do all that in what 37 38

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,070
minutes we've got left probably not

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,170
right so maybe we should do something a

00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:18,640
little more scalable maybe we should

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,660
just talk about this stuff what do you

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,739
think sure sure sounds good okay so

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,540
every time we have these hallway tract

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:28,450
discussions these kind of these circles

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,010
that we talk in typically every question

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,420
we get is something like should I use

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,400
this thing should I build this thing

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,959
should I should I should I should I this

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,720
is how these questions always come out

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,160
and so we thought what we do is probably

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,620
just go ahead and answer your top 10

00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,239
should I questions and answers for

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,130
everybody here and hopefully this will

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,640
answer most of the questions that we

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:50,560
could ask daily basis so this I think

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,980
should be easy for you see them should

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,020
we be using angular should I use angular

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,300
yes I think you should use angular and I

00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:04,150
think everyone here agrees that everyone

00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:06,480
agree should use angular that was easy

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,620
right we're done now next question next

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,989
let's reflect on this because I think

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,010
everyone here understands the benefits

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,780
of angular you understand how it makes

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,370
you more productive it understands how

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,830
it helps you build teams and know

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,440
applications that scale but oftentimes

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,010
we're asked by for example a boss or a

00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,959
colleague

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,700
hey you're using angular should I be

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,110
using angular or maybe you're trying to

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,519
convince someone hey maybe you're trying

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,470
to bring angular and a new part of your

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,629
company or your organization and so I

00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,730
want to give you five reasons that you

00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,440
can give people of why they should be

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,940
using angular and so this is less

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,620
focused on the technology side of things

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,180
because there ends up being a little bit

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,650
of religion when it comes to technology

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,510
whether you like dependency injection

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,910
whether you like services all these

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,830
things have a lot of kind of deeply

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,569
ingrained thoughts that come from

00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,069
experience as developers but I want to

00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:52,060
focus more on kind of the surrounding

00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:54,730
pieces some of the decision making

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,670
frameworks that we use to when we talk

00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,680
about angular and so first I really feel

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,110
that developers love that angular is

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,459
opinionated so we've taken all of the

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,900
different pieces of the developer

00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:07,030
experience that comes from building an

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,290
application and we have an opinion about

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,510
those things and we're gonna provide

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,909
tools that work and and we've tested

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,620
them all together like our HP client

00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:16,120
obviously we're not taking away your

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,739
freedom so you still have the ability

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,450
and the flexibility to do anything

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,340
however you want but we're at least

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,750
giving you a really good default set

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,669
that says these things are gonna work

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,020
together well and this actually is

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:27,460
really important organizations because

00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,010
when you're onboarding new teams when

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,740
you're bringing hiring new people having

00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,630
this opinionated set of capabilities

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,580
tools means that everyone's kind of

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,550
already on the same page even at the

00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,710
beginning we also hear that angular's

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,360
trustworthy so when we say trustworthy

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,159
what we mean is about a year and a half

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,560
ago we set out saying we're gonna follow

00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:49,480
some there we're going to have these red

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,680
Elisa's and we're gonna work really hard

00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,419
to make sure that we're not breaking

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,300
developers with every major release

00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:56,980
right we want you to evolve while still

00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,660
maintaining a level of stability in the

00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,550
platform and I think we've been somewhat

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,520
successful with this right I think when

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,169
we first released 2.0 everyone was like

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,690
oh when are they gonna rebuild it again

00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:11,620
and then we skip three we skip three

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:13,000
don't you remember that but I think

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,990
we've actually have a year and a half of

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,880
track record now where we've been

00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,740
extremely successful in terms of making

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,330
promises saying hey here's our vision

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,000
for the future and then helping to

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,290
realize and fulfill that vision for a

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,240
lot of developers angular is also very

00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,169
familiar so whether developers coming

00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,510
from where the JavaScript ecosystem

00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:29,770
maybe they were angularjs developers or

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,630
whether they're coming from a more

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,360
traditional back in technology like Java

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,130
or.net the mentality in the philosophy

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,840
that angular brings to the table makes a

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,950
lot of sense to most of these people and

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,410
so that that's something we kind of hear

00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:44,050
over and over again we also think about

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,669
angular being scaled so scalability

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,500
scalability it's very nice

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:48,970
so at Google we have a huge amount of

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,130
scalability right we have billions of

00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,360
users but there's also many many

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,039
companies out there that are serving

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,690
billions of users but not only on the

00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:58,000
user side they're also serving teams

00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,710
with thousands of developers and so we

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,090
think about how do we scale projects how

00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,160
do we scale the infrastructure for

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,770
building these applications in a very

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,090
kind of maintainable extensible way and

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,710
not just in terms of numbers of people

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,930
but we also care about having a

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,700
cross-section of individuals being on a

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,740
team so how can designers and product

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,780
managers and developers and architects

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,979
collaborate more effectively and so this

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,950
is something that we're baking into the

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,870
framework in the platform and lastly the

00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,400
ecosystem I don't know if you know this

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:29,360
but everyone here is part of our

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,400
ecosystem welcome right yes

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,870
one of the reasons angular is so

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,099
successful is because there are so many

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,870
people that are building on top of

00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:38,000
angular building libraries building

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,580
tools writing courses training people

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,860
and so the ecosystem continues to grow

00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,210
and I think every day we are amazed and

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,830
impressed by the things that people can

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,069
come up with and contribute back to the

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:51,080
whole ecosystem so with these five

00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:53,210
reasons my hope is that that you can

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,860
answer this question of why angular and

00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,689
take that back to your companies and

00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:00,169
kind of answer this question whenever it

00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:01,879
comes up okay so I think everybody's

00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,409
convinced right the ability a mission

00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,759
they need probably this is the number

00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:06,560
two question we get right immediately

00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,509
after everybody has decided I'm gonna

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,060
use angular the next question is almost

00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:12,620
always well should I use the CLI so sure

00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,719
sure so I think it's really helpful to

00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,389
reflect a little bit on what the CLI is

00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:18,860
and what it does so we have a lot of

00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,629
capabilities today so things like

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,789
scaffolding whether it's ng new ng

00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:24,289
generate but we also have this this new

00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:26,300
mentality that's coming in v6 where we

00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:28,789
can add capabilities so ng add at

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,770
angular /pwa those sorts of things

00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:32,150
there's also a huge amount of work that

00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,009
we've done on the building and serving

00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,539
infrastructure so using webpack under

00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,430
the hood automatically configuring it

00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,930
for all these best practices and then

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,789
also in v6 we've talked a little bit

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,770
about ng update we're just gonna help

00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:45,080
keep you up to date and so there's a lot

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,180
of benefits to the CLI but if you

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,409
summarize them the angular CLI is really

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,479
helpful in terms of helping you move

00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:53,419
faster stay up to date with best

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,849
practices and keep your application in

00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:57,740
sync with all of those best practices so

00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:59,599
that's why you should use the CLI but I

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,919
think there's a lot of people so I would

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,020
say it's probably around 10% of folks

00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,159
that aren't able to use the CLI and so

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,389
we think that it's important to

00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:08,330
acknowledge when you should maybe have

00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:09,770
to go beyond the CLI and this tends to

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,440
happen when you need full control of

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,270
your application so this is when you

00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,710
need to do your own custom web pack

00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,509
loaders right you rather writing your

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,949
own you need to customize them when you

00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:21,379
want to use a different set of tooling

00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:22,879
like system Jas or roll-up or post CSS

00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:25,069
under the hood and you need to have

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,449
fine-grained control of those things or

00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,650
even if you want to do much more

00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:30,139
scalable development of something like

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,000
basil we don't yet have support for

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:34,729
those things fully baked into the CLI

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,560
although that is coming in the future so

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,969
we're really exploring ways for the CLI

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,039
to offer all of these sorts of

00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:42,230
capabilities without having an NG nud

00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,420
project or an NG new workspace

00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,680
but to get these advantages today

00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:48,530
probably just go ahead and use the CLI I

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,600
think it's okay so one of the questions

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,220
that comes up from developers is this

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,420
this ain't your universal thing

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,490
server-side rendering

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,960
when should I be doing that this one's

00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,700
not quite as easy to answer right this

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,950
is one of those classic programming well

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,930
it depends kinds of questions right I

00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,670
think probably the two important

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,470
questions to ask are obviously what are

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,940
you building right and kind of who are

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,740
you building these things for because

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,170
really this is going to inform the

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,920
technology stack you should use so when

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,500
thinking about something like a

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,840
universal obviously content first

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,790
applications are a great candidate for

00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,220
this so forbes.com their article page is

00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,290
a very very content heavy site what's

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,760
most important is they get words on the

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,680
screen as quickly as possible so that

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,450
can people can start to read them so

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,790
content first apps great case for this

00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:34,070
another places where SEO is a business

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,300
critical kind of need Igor did a really

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,860
good talk the other day about SEO and

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,840
using Googlebot and doing client-side

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,030
crawling that works pretty well on the

00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,500
Googlebot side but if you want full SEO

00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,670
compatibility with you know with Bing

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,190
and Yahoo and all the other search

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,320
engines then really Universal should be

00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,510
part of your stack and the other thing

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,680
about is universal users are universal

00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,840
is really great for people who might be

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,310
on mobile devices cases where they're

00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,720
gonna be on slower networks and you want

00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,670
to get usable content out them as

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,050
quickly as possible this is a really

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,080
good time to think about you need using

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,940
Universal cases where you should maybe

00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,490
consider it but not necessarily have to

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,230
do it as your first thing so complex

00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,060
kind of public facing applications where

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,440
these first impressions matter you've

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,000
maybe built an application with you know

00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,830
a thousand modules and it is a hundred

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,480
different things but you can use

00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,790
Universal to get that application up and

00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,260
running so users who hit your page don't

00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,610
kind of sit around waiting for too long

00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,040
and then kind of stumble away from the

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,540
page similarly the app shell pattern

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,400
which is kind of a specialization of

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,140
this this is where you render the outer

00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,480
content shell of your application may be

00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,100
statically at Build time may be on every

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,840
request and again this kind of helps

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,430
with that first impression people come

00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,690
to your application you've ever looked

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,190
at Google Docs this is actually how

00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,290
Google Docs works we kind of render that

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,900
shell and then the rest of the content

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:46,460
kind of streams in and then if you've

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,840
done everything else right if you've

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,830
done all the other best practices you've

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,180
got a service where can you better

00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,590
progressive web app you've optimized

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,310
your CSS and your fonts and all these

00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,990
other things

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,579
at that point it's a reasonable time to

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,470
start thinking about Universal as kind

00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:59,389
of the final cherry on top performance

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,339
optimization but you know it's not

00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:05,329
something that everybody has to do as a

00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:07,279
first thing people who maybe don't need

00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:09,019
to use Universal are people who are

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,670
building kind of intranet apps behind

00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:12,559
the firewall you can of course do this

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,300
we're not saying don't but if you're

00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,249
building kind of internal behind the

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,110
firewall sort of apps this is probably

00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:21,649
not maybe the first step on your angular

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,699
journey existing kind of legacy back-end

00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:24,439
so if you're working with teams who

00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:26,029
maybe aren't comfortable using node into

00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:27,709
production you know maybe you're using a

00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:29,059
different tack stack they want to really

00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,860
you just want to build a you know a

00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:32,269
single page application that's only

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,410
going to run in the client side then

00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:35,629
maybe don't even worry about touching

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,249
Universal obviously it's not kind of

00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,749
relevant to Cordova and native script or

00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:39,980
electron because they're not server-side

00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:41,480
rendered they're being served from a

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,370
kind of local page so don't worry about

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,230
it there the other thing we think it's

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,550
important to say here is if you're just

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,529
starting out with angular if you're just

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,449
learning this is not something you need

00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:52,339
to know on day one right learn how

00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:53,569
angular works get comfortable with it

00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:55,639
and then go ahead and start with

00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:59,389
Universal it's okay to not all use it

00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,500
sort of up front right our friend Vikram

00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:02,029
from the angular team he's gonna give a

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,889
talk today I'm going to a little more

00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:05,449
depth on how to think about doing

00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,370
server-side rendering how to think about

00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:09,350
when to use Universal and kind of some

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,550
of the the various strategies we've

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,379
looked at in terms of server-side

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,730
rendering and hybrid rendering and kind

00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:17,300
of where we do went so definitely check

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:19,490
that talk out all right so I there's a

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,990
lot of kind of meaty questions that we

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,209
have to answer that have kind of complex

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,410
answers where often it depends but we

00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,360
wanted to run through a couple questions

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:30,699
where the answers are maybe a little bit

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,699
simpler should I write unit tests yep

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:39,910
yeah you should populate some unitest

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:44,650
put it on the checklist maybe check it

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:46,810
off at some point it's easy easy should

00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,880
I write end-to-end tests what do you

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,250
think go ahead

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,100
so this one's yes yes but probably not

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,900
quite as many intent tests as unit tests

00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,100
right so just for quick point of

00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,660
reference you might write a unit test

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,310
you test your shopping cart that you

00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,200
know adding an item with shoddy the

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,370
shopping cart creates the right total at

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,050
least and kind of micro little

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,790
interactions then you might write a

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,140
couple of end-to-end tests to test that

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,480
a user can go through the whole kind of

00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,250
checkout flow right but definitely

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:17,470
definitely be writing both kinds of

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:21,160
tests so we're sani is sending in the

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:22,300
room well I love we'd love to ask him

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,970
this question should I use reactive

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:29,500
forms yep

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:32,020
easy pretty easy easy all right

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,270
so so this one comes up all the time

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,560
this is a big big deal for Google at the

00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,760
moment we're talking a lot about this we

00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,600
were talking about it the chrome team is

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,250
talking about it

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,810
they've just come to edge there looks

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,940
like they're coming to Safari right so

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,680
we get a lot of questions should I build

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,440
a progressive web app when should I do

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,690
that sure so again I want to go back to

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,190
beyond just the technology and think a

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,870
little bit about the the basics of what

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,670
we're trying to achieve so when we talk

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,520
about any sort of delivering of

00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:00,160
applications on mobile it's all really

00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,780
about the experience right you're trying

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,550
to accomplish a better experience for

00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,200
your users so that when your user is

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,380
sitting in the back of a conference hall

00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,910
like this one on their phone you want to

00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,550
make an engaging experience that's gonna

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:16,720
help them engage with you and be

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:18,700
productive so there's a lot of really

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,500
great ways to deliver these experiences

00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,350
on the screen that the users using which

00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,930
I think in the u.s. it's like 72% of the

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,460
time is on mobile now there's Cordova

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,690
where you take a webview and you're

00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,800
wrapping an angular application that's

00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,810
really good because you get to reuse a

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,190
lot of code you've got technologies like

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,180
native script where you can use an

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,210
angular application and all the

00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,010
JavaScript you know and love and

00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:42,040
manifest that application as native UI

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:43,180
widgets instead of HTML in a webview but

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,499
you can also go out and build a native

00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,909
application right you can write some

00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:47,949
hotland write some Swift and deliver

00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:49,719
applications that are built in the

00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:52,239
technologies provided by the platforms

00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:54,219
but then we also think about PW as so

00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:56,439
how do we build an application that is a

00:14:54,219 --> 00:14:57,909
web application to start but then

00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:59,949
whenever there's a device that has these

00:14:57,909 --> 00:15:01,239
additional capabilities it's taking

00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:03,099
advantage of those and progressively

00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:05,009
offering a better experience through

00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:07,749
things like offline through things like

00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:09,549
being able to work in a less reliable

00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:10,389
connection or even being more engaging

00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:14,849
with something like push notifications

00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:17,439
and so when I think about these mobile

00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:18,939
api's that are available in the native

00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:21,399
space so if you're looking at Cordova a

00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:22,749
native script or native there's things

00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,429
like fingerprint access there's things

00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:26,439
like contacts where sometimes you want

00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:28,239
to be engaging with the mobile platform

00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,709
a little bit more deeply and not all of

00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:31,419
these things are in the browser yet

00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:33,969
right so you can't necessarily take

00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:35,529
advantage of these things in a PWA alone

00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:37,149
right so you may if you want these

00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:38,649
capabilities have to be building an

00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:41,619
installed application that sits in the

00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:43,809
App Store but I like to think that

00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:46,509
probably in 2018 you're also having to

00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:48,549
deliver a web experience right you it's

00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:50,289
very hard to get away with just a pure

00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:51,279
mobile experience because a lot of the

00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:53,289
work that we do and a lot of the

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,639
experiences that we're building are more

00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:56,409
engaging than that were they're more

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,849
transactional than that where I can't

00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:58,779
yet build a relationship and get someone

00:15:57,849 --> 00:16:00,159
to download my app from the app store

00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:01,449
they just want to visit a website

00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,639
they're gonna follow a link and then we

00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:05,229
want hit a great experience and so if

00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,689
you have to deliver a great web

00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:08,649
experience anyway you can progressively

00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:11,289
enhance that with additional

00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,699
capabilities and so if your application

00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:14,259
when you think about it if a more

00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:16,809
reliable or engaging web experience

00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:18,429
would be helpful to your users if it

00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,049
would benefit you then it's probably

00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:25,599
time to think about adding PWA

00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:26,589
capabilities so elements i I've heard a

00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,319
little bit about elements at this

00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:31,179
conference you guys heard about elements

00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:33,599
all right so now the important question

00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:36,419
is should I be using them question

00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:38,579
obviously yes everybody all the time yes

00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:41,259
so it's a little more nuanced than that

00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:42,399
I think great use cases for today things

00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:44,109
where you should kind of immediately

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,249
start looking at elements the first one

00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:46,899
is the case that we're using them for

00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:49,449
write the angular dot IO a web site or

00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:50,949
we've got a bunch of static HTML we want

00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:52,769
to kind of sprinkle this enhanced

00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:55,029
functionality into these static pages

00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:56,860
elements are ideal for this two day

00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:58,810
tomorrow whenever you want to use them

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,130
start looking at it the other cases we

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,780
think it's really useful today it's a

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,810
good time to start looking at it is this

00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,490
kind of micro front-end mini app kind of

00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,750
concept for you might write you know an

00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,830
application out of a few different

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,810
components you might have different

00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,580
pages in it might have services and talk

00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,839
to backends and all of that and then you

00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,190
want to package it up in kind of a

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,020
container that you can hand to somebody

00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,280
to drop into some other context so I

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,130
think we're really really good for that

00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,630
kind of today also if you're an advanced

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,040
team you're really kind of pushing the

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,870
boundaries of what I enjoying angular

00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,459
can do you're comfortable kind of

00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,110
messing with the lower-level guts of

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:31,990
angular it's a really good time to start

00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,070
it and jump into elements there pretty

00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,200
soon here there'll be a whole bunch more

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:36,250
interesting use cases so the one that I

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,290
always like to talk about it's this idea

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,390
of only ever having to write one date

00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,820
picker ever again right nobody having to

00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,620
do that ever so you could do that today

00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,970
it's not quite as easy we'd like it and

00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,010
again we're not really optimizing for

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,690
that case by the time IB comes out in

00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,010
the next six months this is a really

00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,560
good time to start thinking about that

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,090
again content first sites and kind of

00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,740
hydrating service had rendered pages

00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,120
these are cases we're beginning to

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,430
explore we'd love if you're comfortable

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,200
for you to begin to explore them but for

00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:04,150
everybody it may not be in that space

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,560
quite yet and again Vikram is going to

00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,790
talk about this in his talk could dive

00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:10,000
into some of the strategies that were

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:12,760
prototyping inside of Google I should

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,530
say though if your primary user base is

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,110
gonna be in our Explorer you should

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:19,540
probably think twice the polyfills exist

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,070
you can use them but they're quite

00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,530
prohibitive in terms of cost and

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,690
performance so you know if 2% of your

00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:29,020
user basis elements or is it an explorer

00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,340
then great try it out but if 98% you use

00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,180
your basis in order to explore it's

00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,980
probably not the right tool and that's

00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,200
okay right we're gonna we're here to say

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,510
to you it's okay to not use everything

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,920
all the time right you come to a

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,110
conference like this you see all this

00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,820
amazing cool new technology you get home

00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,950
your minds kind of blown right and you

00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,150
think about where do I start you don't

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,200
have to start with a straightaway right

00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,490
it'll be there

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,930
later if you need it so this one comes

00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,960
up all the time as well what about

00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:01,180
material should I use that sure so the

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,430
angular material is Google's the angular

00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,320
team's manifestation of the material

00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,760
design philosophy from Google where

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,070
we've created a set of components the

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,080
take this these all these cool ideas of

00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:15,440
like a user experience that's built on

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,030
paper elements or analogues to things

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,550
that we know and love in the real world

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,710
giving you designs in terms of shapes

00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:24,410
how much margin you should do and if you

00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,580
like the material design aesthetic you

00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,500
should use material design you should

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,940
use angular material that one's pretty

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,460
easy but I think there's actually a much

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,680
more complex thing here because secret

00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,780
angular apps are built out of components

00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,190
I don't know if you guys knew that but

00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,930
if you look at the source code like view

00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,670
source and Mike pull up all the

00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,740
underlying things there's components in

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,230
there and so often we're building more

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,910
and more components as developers and so

00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,530
there gets a point where you should

00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,150
probably be reusing some things right

00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:52,040
you should probably be taking and saying

00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,750
hey instead of building this thing over

00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,330
and over and over are there pieces that

00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:58,190
I could take advantage of as a developer

00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,300
and not be rebuilding the wheel and so

00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,250
this is one thing that component

00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,200
libraries are really really good at and

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,840
so one of things that Rob and I have

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,390
kind of shared and figured out is every

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,710
company we talk to the end of asking us

00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,930
like hey we're building this component

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:14,750
library are we doing this right yes

00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:16,160
everyone here is at some point going to

00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,350
be using a component library or building

00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,900
your own app every company has their own

00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:23,690
typically using it my company initials

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,430
UI I think about 60% of the cases that's

00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,070
that's what we've seen and yet the other

00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:31,490
40% is the something design system yep

00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:34,360
almost exactly so if you have more than

00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,360
zero developers

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,210
not all of you use a component library I

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:42,510
think there's one in the back that has

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,740
less than zero but when we think about

00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,330
some in organizational standpoint

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,309
there's a few best practices that we

00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:50,820
recommend that we hear people asking us

00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:52,679
about a lot so often it's really better

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,090
to have a team that is focused on

00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,030
building that component library it gives

00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:59,070
them a focus it gives them a passion and

00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:01,860
a priority in terms of making something

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,419
better for the entire organization and

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,440
one of things I love to see from these

00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,360
component libraries and from these

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,730
internal teams these their focus on

00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,740
saying hey well we have a design system

00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,480
at our company that's mandated but

00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,549
there's we can't mandate the technology

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,169
side of things right so we have to focus

00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:18,720
on building something that's so good

00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:20,190
that people want to opt in and I think

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,020
that design systems and component

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,520
libraries it's actually really easy to

00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,630
do this because if you really focus on

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,789
the user experience things like

00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,650
accessibility you're gonna build

00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:30,450
something that saves developers time so

00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,340
when a new team is spinning up or

00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,750
building out a new product it should be

00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,159
easy for them to say of course we're

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,110
gonna go use the standard component

00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:38,159
library from the other team because it's

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,289
gonna save us time we're not gonna

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,840
rebuild everything for our specific

00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:44,640
product we also really recommend

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,010
extending the cdk of the component dev

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,480
kit we've spent a lot of time baking and

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,799
all the best practices you need to build

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,640
accessible apps to build applications

00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:56,250
that to things like overlays properly

00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,890
and we've baked all these behaviors into

00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:01,110
our CDK and so for any component library

00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:04,020
out there it's probably Advent pages to

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,429
you to take a look at cdk we've heard

00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,500
from many companies that they already

00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:08,880
started building their own and so

00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,710
obviously if you're doing that keep

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,480
going but definitely take a look at the

00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,010
cdk because the cdks gonna continue to

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,380
evolve and we're going to keep solving a

00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,909
lot of these common problems and the

00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,480
last best practice for organizations is

00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:22,770
really all about opening yourself up to

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,150
creating more adoption and so what I

00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,860
mean by this is not every component

00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,270
library can be open source we definitely

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,150
understand that it would be cool if you

00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:33,510
did though yes open source it's parently

00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:35,460
a successful model for businesses so but

00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,200
even if you can't open source it fully

00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,030
can you open your code to internal

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,830
contribution from other people within

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,179
your organization what we've seen is

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,890
that when you do this you're actually

00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,630
gonna drive additional adoption because

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,610
they other teams are gonna be able to

00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,269
take ownership of the work and they're

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,190
also going to need

00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:51,570
salt or be able to solve their own needs

00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,639
which is going to make the component

00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:56,669
library more effective better for

00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:58,649
everyone so if you're building a

00:22:56,669 --> 00:23:01,409
component library which you are we know

00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:03,839
we didn't have to fire anything to find

00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:05,609
that out and just talk to you use the

00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,789
component dive kit build the component

00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:10,950
library and be happy what do animations

00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:11,459
feel like a lot of work sometimes are

00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,159
they worth it

00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:16,499
animation so I really like to talk about

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,299
animations because I think most people

00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:21,959
don't actually use animations how many

00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:24,809
people don't use animations okay most

00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:27,479
people here half-half alright so this

00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:30,179
question is for all of you right I like

00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:31,979
to simplify animations as more work more

00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,299
benefit right they they're not

00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:34,709
necessarily automatic because you have

00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:36,539
to be intentional about how you use them

00:23:34,709 --> 00:23:38,549
so you have to do some work to add them

00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:40,139
to your application in the right way but

00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:42,059
there are a lot of benefits to them

00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:44,609
beyond just making it kind of look

00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:46,919
pretty so I really like to translate

00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:48,749
this into business reasons and so the

00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,159
first one is responsiveness so when we

00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:52,019
build applications we've seen over and

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,299
over and over that the more performant

00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:55,440
your application looks and feels the

00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,879
better outcomes you're gonna have for

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,159
your application whether that's consumer

00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:01,169
facing whether that's any one facing by

00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,059
having animations you can do things like

00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:05,279
immediately respond to a button click

00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:06,749
whether that's the Enki animations you

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,359
get from material design or some other

00:24:06,749 --> 00:24:11,579
response that says i've received the

00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,259
intent from the user and i'm working on

00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:14,429
it because often our applications have

00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:15,719
to go do some work and we can't

00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:17,639
immediately give the user the response

00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:20,070
we want and so animations are a way of

00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:22,559
saying hey it's okay we're doing this

00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,029
together we're working on it another

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,139
really important piece of animations can

00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,929
do is it can give a sense of hierarchy

00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:30,239
so I've seen a lot of applications do

00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:32,219
this anti-pattern where you build an

00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:34,019
application the UX is a little bit too

00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:35,999
complicated people can't quite figure it

00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:37,799
out and they end up putting a tutorial

00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:40,259
as their first screen right like oh

00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:42,269
welcome to my app step one of 23

00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:46,259
explaining how to do this this is not

00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:48,389
good really so so hopefully no no one's

00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:50,669
here has to do that and one of the tools

00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:51,869
in your toolbox to help users understand

00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:54,089
what's going on in the application is

00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:55,859
animations you can create indicators

00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:57,839
that say hey here's where you are in a

00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:58,720
hierarchy of the application and here's

00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,240
how you're moving

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,980
right these subtle visual indicators are

00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,420
really powerful in terms of informing a

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,920
user what they're doing in your

00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,230
application and whether or not they're

00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,020
headed in the right direction another

00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,980
piece I like to touch on is status so

00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,380
applications especially single page

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,820
applications are not a one-way data dump

00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,230
most of the time right it's a two-way

00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,090
conversation with the user where the

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,350
user has to do something we have to do

00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,240
something on the application side of

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,250
things and so having animations is a

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,110
very subtle indicator that again better

00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,630
connects the user to your application

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,460
and the last piece is kind of what you

00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:32,440
expect it right so it's that sense of

00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,840
delight but it's also a sense of

00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,700
branding right you as companies and

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,560
organizations we all spend a lot of time

00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,140
trying to create a sense of feeling like

00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,420
this is my app these are my users I'm

00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,520
creating a cohesive and end experience

00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,650
for them and animations can play a huge

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,130
role in creating those feelings across

00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:53,050
multiple devices and don't forget a lot

00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,360
of people do forget employees are users

00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,980
- I found this study from the Journal of

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,810
labor economics it said that happy

00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,910
employees are 12% more productive and so

00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,110
next time you think oh it's an employee

00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:04,750
app it doesn't matter if it looks good

00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:06,190
as a matter if it works well it does if

00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,630
you're making your employees happy if

00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,370
you're making them more productive

00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:11,980
that's a good thing for your business

00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,420
and it's worth investing in the takeaway

00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:18,790
here is Stephen reads the Journal of

00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:22,150
labor economics not every day it's like

00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:23,740
a week weekly thing so and your ex does

00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,810
anybody know what ng or X is there's

00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:29,740
like 9 talks about it and you call a

00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:32,230
couple of people yeah but your ex is

00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:34,630
maybe more complex than not using

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:37,960
engineer X maybe should I use it

00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:39,100
stop we'll talk about it yeah ok so the

00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,650
first question need to ask before you

00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,450
decide am I gonna use ng or X is do I

00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,250
actually need a state management library

00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,140
this is a real question this is not a

00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,270
made-up question you should ask yourself

00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,490
this question before you do anything

00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,960
Danny Abramoff who wrote Redux has a

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,700
really great article called you might

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,110
not need redox it's worth reading

00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,970
it covers kind of the same stuff we're

00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,980
talking about here but consider do you

00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:02,350
need it and to think about that you

00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,540
might if you're brand new to angular

00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,530
again you might not need to plug end

00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,710
Gerak's in on

00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:11,170
day one that's okay right angular has a

00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,580
lot going on you may get into it it's

00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:15,040
someday in the future but you don't need

00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,660
to do it on day one learn angular get

00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,610
comfortable with how it works you know

00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,590
NGO X is just a service it's not

00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,210
anything magical so get comfortable how

00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,490
to assemble an application how to

00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,960
compose services when you're comfortable

00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,810
doing that then maybe look into a state

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,740
management solution like ng rx

00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:31,150
additionally you know you're using just

00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,770
you're building a small app maybe yours

00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,510
building a to-do app you're building a

00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,860
simple little widget you may not need a

00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:37,600
state management solution for one of

00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,210
these things again that's perfectly oh

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,410
okay

00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,180
sometimes we get challenged on like well

00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,440
I don't like such and such about ng rx

00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,180
or I don't like such and such about

00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,310
solution if you're comfortable with your

00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:52,090
own thing that's totally fine right it's

00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:53,590
absolutely okay to use your own solution

00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,970
as long as you're comfortable doing it

00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,450
and if you're happy with what you're

00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,070
doing

00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,520
continue doing it we're not here to

00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:02,590
convince you to change how you do things

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,850
but if you do need the library here's

00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:05,710
some considerations to take into account

00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,240
number one make sure it's well supported

00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,500
right make sure that there's a team of

00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,120
people are working on it make sure

00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,770
there's tutorials there's blogs there's

00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,470
all the things you need to be successful

00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:16,570
with the tool you've picked that doesn't

00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,260
have to be ng rx right clearly I'm a

00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,090
little biased

00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,190
I wrote the thing funny story a couple

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,570
people come to the elevator in yesterday

00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,130
and said to me how the center X is

00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:27,450
really complicated and I said wow that's

00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:29,320
sad because I wrote the thing sorry and

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,610
debra came up to you at dinner and she

00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:36,880
said hey have you have you ever used an

00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:38,830
to your X so you know Andres is a great

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,390
choice I'm biased clearly but you know

00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,530
there's Redux there's mob X there's ng

00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,540
excess from Austin there's all these

00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:45,160
cool new things coming out this is a big

00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,050
reason why we don't have any or X as

00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,520
part of an angular core right we want

00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:50,800
this innovation to come from the

00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:53,200
community we want new solutions we want

00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,460
people to build cool stuff the most

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,230
important thing is if you're going to

00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:59,440
use the state management solution or not

00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:01,360
choose a pattern stick with it make sure

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,430
your team agrees on it right make sure

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,440
everybody's happy using it and enforce

00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:07,930
those consistent behaviors with code

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,430
review with tooling with linting right

00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:11,350
these kind of solutions are most

00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,820
successful when the whole team is on

00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:16,930
board when everybody's using the same

00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:18,240
pattern things go pretty well I'm going

00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,679
to just address this word

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,120
real quick though right this has come up

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,700
a couple not in the conference this is a

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,470
big question we get about ng rx what

00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,900
about all the boilerplate and I'd like

00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:30,030
to propose maybe a compromise here right

00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,620
boilerplate to me is kind of the wrong

00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:34,020
word to talk about because it implies a

00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,030
level of unnecessary kind of

00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,140
functionality right boilerplate is may

00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,309
be the wrong word so I'm just gonna

00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,720
cross it out

00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:42,090
and maybe we should think about this in

00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,250
a different way so to reframe this maybe

00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:46,559
let's think about explicit versus

00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,390
implicit right and GX is a thing that

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,190
requires you to do a number of things

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,990
you do actions you do playing objects

00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,660
you have reducers what you're doing is

00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,370
being very very explicit by contract

00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,559
some other solutions are more implicit

00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:00,870
neither of these things is wrong or

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,700
right that's important right but use

00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:04,650
this kind of framing to talk to your

00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,940
team about what's important to you talk

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,860
to your team about what's the best way

00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,260
to do things for yourself maybe and Rex

00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,059
maybe something else but use this

00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,770
because boilerplate kind of gets

00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:15,600
everybody stuck in the wrong thinking

00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,370
for actually making conscious technical

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,080
decisions right so explicit versus

00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,970
implicit I stole this from mieszko

00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,160
Michiko tells me this all the time when

00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,300
I'm complaining him about things so this

00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,690
isn't maybe a different way to think

00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:31,230
about things so there's actually a few

00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:33,120
companies here you may have been walked

00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:35,490
past their booths that offer paid

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:40,050
services and training should you use

00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:42,870
them is it worth it so if you feel like

00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:44,910
this maybe it's worth thinking about

00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:47,490
right I feel like this sometimes and I

00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:48,900
work on the angular team so when to call

00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:50,250
for help right like wouldn't you call in

00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,410
the professionals when do you call now

00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,030
two expert one of the best times we see

00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:55,410
to do this is if you work on an

00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,150
experienced team you're at a big company

00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,679
you know but you've been building on a

00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,120
different technology stack you may be

00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,100
using Java on the back end you may be

00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,929
using dotnet you may have never written

00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,520
a single page application before you may

00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:07,410
have no idea what a web component is

00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,059
right if you're changing technology

00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,010
stacks this is a good time to get an

00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:12,900
outside team to come in somebody's able

00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,910
to speak kind of both languages do the

00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,590
old and the new and translate these

00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:18,390
concepts for you fairly often that's

00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,470
money well spent for a couple of days of

00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,020
kind of getting everybody in the right

00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,790
headspace again if you're building

00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:27,240
something kind of super specialized or

00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:28,530
complex or crazy that's a perfectly good

00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,809
time to bring in an expert right

00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,770
somebody who's worked at WebGL before

00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:34,350
worked with some of these really

00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,010
bleeding-edge new PWA technologies if

00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,570
you're doing something you're not

00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:38,010
comfortable doing for the first time

00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,840
you're doing something kind of brand new

00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:41,340
it's perfectly reasonable to bring in an

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,840
outside expert a couple of days you know

00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,120
get everybody from moving in the right

00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,770
direction same thing you know you're a

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,300
brand new team you put together a new

00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,919
company whatever it's not about easy to

00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,720
get a team of experts to come in for a

00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,130
few days get everybody working in the

00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,960
right patterns you know get a style

00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:57,419
guide going get this you know your kind

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,800
of us design system up and running all

00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:59,669
these things can be helped than expert

00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,360
they don't have to sit with you the

00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:02,370
whole time

00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,080
we do find it quite to be quite useful

00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,520
to bring in an outside consultancy

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,250
sometimes to get everybody kind of

00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,870
moving the regulation here's some things

00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,850
to remember right so the first thing is

00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:13,919
your time is valuable too right think

00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,510
about what you get paid per hour and

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,340
think about when you stared at your

00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,900
computer screen for six hours stuck on a

00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,179
thing right how much time have you

00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:24,540
wasted there so keep this in mind right

00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:26,040
all the people who write angular content

00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,500
that's blog posts and videos and

00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,030
training courses and tutorials and you

00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,070
know there's just all this stuff every

00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,480
day I probably get 50 notifications on

00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,490
Twitter about some cool new thing that

00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,470
somebody's done it's awesome all of

00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,090
these people are people in the angular

00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:41,940
community and a lot of them are in this

00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,860
room sitting next to you right these are

00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,120
people who are just like you they may

00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,600
have started out knowing nothing about

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,800
angular

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,360
they may have started out knowing

00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,760
everything about perturbing and all of

00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,940
them take time out of their day to rate

00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,320
to make great content for you couple

00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,910
those I just want to call out Todd motto

00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,559
this is ultimate angular thing

00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:01,290
Todd motto again like many people

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,850
learned in grx by doing ng rx it's kind

00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:04,320
of put this video course together I

00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,550
point out Todd motto because if you

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,330
noticed in the bottom right corner of

00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:10,710
the screen here right behind me we

00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,270
actually recommend this at Google right

00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,309
it's such a good course it's so useful

00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:16,710
the team is using enter X inside of

00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:19,320
Google actually call on Todd about his

00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:22,590
course so this is pretty cool they want

00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,540
to call out is Sam Julien Sam came to me

00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,220
I don't know six months a year ago he'd

00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,059
really struggled with upgrade kind of

00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,740
getting his head wrapped around the

00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:30,300
whole thing so he basically locked

00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:33,390
himself in a room for six months and

00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:35,340
wrote this amazing amazing course on how

00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,510
to do upgrading from angularjs right if

00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,700
you're doing anything with upgrading

00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:40,380
check this out because at this point Sam

00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,450
knows probably more about upgrade than

00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,770
anybody on the angular team right so

00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,780
it's a really really good thing to check

00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,670
out again the key here is that everybody

00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,410
who's does these kind of videos are in

00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:51,090
the community and the more we support

00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:53,730
them the better content everybody's

00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:56,160
gonna get we keep a list of these

00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:58,800
resources on angularjs last resources

00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,360
you know if you are a content creator or

00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,100
a trainer your consultancy you can send

00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,470
us a pull request get added to this list

00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:08,100
this is a good place to start to look

00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:10,350
when you need help the other one is our

00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,879
Gator channel people often ask me Rob

00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:14,340
how did you learn angular and the true

00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:17,040
story is that I sat in IRC and git er

00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,690
for many many months trying to answer

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,610
questions and the first couple of months

00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:22,379
I knew nothing kind of stared at the

00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:24,270
computer screen and very quickly you try

00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:25,830
things out you get to help people and

00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,570
that feedback loop is actually one of

00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,220
the best ways to learn a piece like use

00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:31,530
of technology when I checked this

00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,840
morning there were 15,000 people in our

00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:36,270
Gator channel a lot of our incredibly

00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,620
helpful knowledgeable people the core

00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,120
team hangs out and they're sometimes so

00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,230
if you need help if you need to kind of

00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,149
get your brain wrapped around something

00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,560
you don't understand something maybe

00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:44,669
you're not sure if this is a bug or an

00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,590
issue or maybe you don't know what

00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:48,690
you're doing come together first there's

00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:50,070
tons of helpful people there checking

00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,600
with them is this something we can use

00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,740
can we do this and they'll tell you

00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,149
right you're doing something wrong

00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,310
here's maybe something you should learn

00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:58,170
or yeah this is a bug go ahead and file

00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:59,190
it on the github repo so definitely

00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,390
check out get er I know there's a bunch

00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,650
of them watching them from home so

00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,540
thanks to everybody on the Gator channel

00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:07,230
we really appreciate everything that you

00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:09,660
do and thanks for having us so so let's

00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,250
let's recap a little bit so we started

00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,530
this off talking about conversations

00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:16,050
that the questions that come in to us

00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,160
every single day so this is not to say

00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,840
don't come and ask those questions we

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,130
actually love that so even if you want

00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,320
to ask us one of these questions on the

00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:23,640
list it's still okay but our hope guys

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,350
you only got twenty two point two

00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,390
seconds to do 20 22 seconds if you're

00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:30,540
gonna ask you care to everybody should I

00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:31,620
use unit testing you tap that 10 second

00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:35,580
that only takes two seconds to answer

00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:37,170
that so but at the same time like we

00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:39,060
really hope that we've answered a lot of

00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,650
these top questions that a lot of people

00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,840
have in their minds some of us even too

00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,130
afraid to ask and so again I did a

00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,470
little bit of math I pulled out my

00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:49,410
calculator we very scientifically today

00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:53,750
have saved about five thousand and six

00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:53,750
hours good whoa we did it

00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:01,200
this means we can go on vacation right I

00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:03,660
think we deserve like three weeks cool

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,960
alright thank you everyone thanks for

00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,960
