Wow hello and welcome in the next 20

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,190
minutes we are going to talk about

00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,429
angularjs migration let's first have a

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,990
show of hands how many of you have done

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:21,539
any migration work not necessarily

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:26,369
angular well a lot of women and how many

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:28,490
of you still enjoy that experience well

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:36,050
I don't blame you

00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:36,050
well if I can make this work on a second

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,640
well migration is very hard you can

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,430
easily be one of the most challenging

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,610
and least enjoyable experience you can

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,710
have because dealing with a legacy

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,160
system probably somebody else built

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,600
before you and the guy moved on you

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,449
don't know anything about you don't know

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,510
enough about this system and now you're

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:03,949
asked to take this apart check every

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,619
part inside and then put it back in and

00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:10,380
it should still work and that's really

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,580
not review and we are here to learn how

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,610
we can make your job a little easier so

00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:21,470
in the introduction and my name is

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,540
Hannah Shaw I'm founder of angular talk

00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:26,970
I'll be in the software business for

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,640
over 20 years I've done a lot of things

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,220
but one thing I enjoyed is building

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:37,020
developer tools I said and I said I was

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:40,350
Eclipse plug-in developer and angry dog

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,290
is my brainchild it's essentially a

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,680
static analysis tool that can scan your

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,500
angular project we extract metadata from

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,360
your source code piece together all the

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,460
information at a high level to gain

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,549
deeper understanding of your application

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,770
so then we can feed back to you a bunch

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,890
of visualizations for you to look at

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,469
your own application and then based on

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:08,610
that knowledge we can go further we can

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:10,709
do code generation and that's why we

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,890
think we can help in the migration

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:17,100
process

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:20,310
now if you want to use angular today you

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,290
can install the vs code extension and if

00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,480
you are looking at an angular project

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,120
and there's a button you can click and

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,310
we have editor that pops up to show

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,230
these diagrams that we derived from our

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:37,650
analysis but we are facing out this UI

00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:41,340
in favor of this this is what you get

00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:45,780
from the website and we allow you to do

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,519
the filtering searching and so with the

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,180
same melody that you now have a much

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,880
better user experience and just last

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,790
month we did something really cool with

00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:00,870
the help of the angular team we scand

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:04,110
github to find all the angular Edition

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:08,430
ripples that we can find and we found

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:11,489
about 80 800 of them we analyzed each of

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:15,330
these projects and now in the metadata

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:19,290
and the visualization is up on angular

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:21,959
org if you had any open source projects

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,950
for angular chances are they're already

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:29,280
on the website so check it out and with

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,440
this many data we have created we can

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
run a lot of interesting queries so one

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,660
thing we did for the migration purpose

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,500
is to find out what can the data tell us

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:44,750
about migration the state of migration

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:48,660
so I offer you two pieces of statistics

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:51,090
first is that we went look for projects

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,600
that have the dependency on angle

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,500
upgrade why do we care about the package

00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,540
because it gives us the upgrade module

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,040
the one that can push up our angularjs

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,200
application within the angular

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,560
application so if you're not familiar

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,320
with this so-called upgrade shell I have

00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,220
a link at the end for a block that and

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:17,549
our folks did they did a very good job

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,320
explaining the concept but briefly we're

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,019
creating an angular application

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,360
but it's only a shell and we immediately

00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,940
bootstrap your angularjs application so

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,760
everything inside

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,980
running angularjs then you can

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,740
incrementally upgrade one component at a

00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:36,410
time and gradually you reach a hundred

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,300
percent of angular components but

00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:44,360
throughout the process your application

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:46,670
remains functional so we want over for

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,970
the hundred of these projects and that's

00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:52,820
very impressive it's sixty percent or

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,380
one out of six right so that's very good

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,700
news it means a lot of people interested

00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,970
in moving their energies into angular

00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:05,510
however if we look at the next graph

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:09,230
when we plot these ripples against the

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:11,990
angular version on the far left we start

00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:15,320
with a very first version 2.0 right it

00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:18,230
has the biggest number of repos 842 to

00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,110
be exact but as we advanced the angular

00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:24,410
version the number drops like a rock

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:27,140
beyond 2x it's really insignificant and

00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:29,930
that's concerning right it probably

00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:33,200
means that most of these 2 dot X

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:36,190
projects are inactive as of March this

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,230
year right it's been a long time Polly

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:41,900
has been abandoned for various reasons

00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:46,280
but could it be that they couldn't even

00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:49,669
finish in the upper grade right and as I

00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:54,740
said the upgrade is really a tough

00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:57,680
business and we have these I summarized

00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,910
it as three areas where we can where we

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,410
do need a lot of help

00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:05,600
the first is planning right how do you

00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,160
even plan the migration process if you

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,669
don't know enough about your legacy

00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,630
system right and how do you know which

00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:17,900
priorities to set we want to start with

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:21,680
a smaller subsystem somewhat isolated

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,080
right so we gain more experience we gain

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,800
confidence and then we will be ready to

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,930
tackle bigger systems but without enough

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,720
readability we can do that and you

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:36,050
cannot go to your boss and say we need

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,889
six months you ask what's your basis for

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:42,949
that estimate right and then in a second

00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:47,599
area we have that upgrade module to deal

00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:50,449
with it does work but before you can

00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:52,879
work there will be a lot of manual steps

00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:55,370
you need to perform and it's very hard

00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:59,030
to get your right so it reminds me of

00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:02,000
the clockwork the clockwork is an

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:04,430
engineering marvel it runs so smoothly

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,460
it's so accurate but we often forget

00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,889
that inside we have so many parts they

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,500
have to be in the right place otherwise

00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:14,479
the clock just doesn't work right so I

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,750
feel the same way about the upgrade

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,689
module and people struggling he was

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:24,199
struggling to scaffolding the hybrid

00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:27,969
project and they need help in this area

00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:31,479
too and then when we get to individual

00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:34,340
upgrade for the components we deal with

00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:36,699
upgrading the business logic and we're

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,909
dealing with upgrading HTML template

00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:42,800
right it has a whole new set of syntax I

00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:46,129
don't know why they did it but they did

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,550
it anyway right and it will be so tough

00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:52,400
if we have tweaked every file to locate

00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,699
all these small places in you need to

00:07:52,400 --> 00:08:00,490
fix so putting all these together we are

00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:03,740
thinking well what can we do to help and

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:06,469
we have been working very hard to come

00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:11,300
up with this tune that we call angular

00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:14,539
to pilot we call it copilot because you

00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:17,180
are still in charge you need to provide

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:19,580
input you need to guide this to tell

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,650
this to what to do but then when you

00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:25,479
told it to what to do you will do the

00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:29,389
body work for you in a consistent manner

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:33,140
and it's essentially and a desktop

00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:36,169
edition of angular dog we took the

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:40,490
static analysis engine and embedded it

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:42,800
into this test desktop application so

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,380
now you can run the same analysis on

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,480
local machine if you have a closed

00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,750
source project you don't need to worry

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,520
about any source data leaving your

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,020
organization we don't really do that

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,000
but some people have that consent of

00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,310
valued concern and we don't you must

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,130
send the metadata out it's everything is

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:09,020
happening on your local machine right

00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:12,000
and specifically we can actually analyze

00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:16,650
angularjs applications and that's a huge

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,500
break right I urge you to go ahead and

00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,780
install copy that copilot runs through

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,530
your application see what they can tell

00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:28,620
you you'll be amazed a lot of people

00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:31,050
came to me and told me that and then

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:34,410
specifically for the migration we also

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:36,270
had premium features the first of which

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,840
is the wizard that can take you

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:43,620
step-by-step to set up your hybrid

00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:47,040
application so I I think it's analogous

00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,990
to TurboTax so for people who are not

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,410
familiar with the American taxation

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:54,650
system it's super complex and yet

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:58,410
everybody is required to file income tax

00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:02,160
tax returns every year and you had to

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:04,080
fill out a gazillion forms then turret

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,600
had came along and said don't worry

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,210
about the forms here's the list of

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,000
questions you need to answer but once

00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:14,880
you do we'll punch in the numbers will

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,920
fill other forms for you so this is what

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,950
we are trying to do here and I can do a

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:23,250
quick demo of that later on and the

00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:26,250
second feature we implemented was we

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,950
because we know the components and the

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,630
interdependencies we actually understand

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,990
the dependency injection for each of

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:36,810
your component so we have a table that

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,180
shows your angularjs component in a

00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:41,340
first column in a second column it's

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,670
either button for you to create to do

00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:47,280
the upgrade or it's if you already

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,790
upgraded it it would be the angular

00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:53,160
component but the third column shows the

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:55,710
dependencies for that component so we

00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,870
want to upgrade all the dependencies

00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:01,530
before we take on the upgrade of that

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:04,380
particular component and then last but

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:07,529
not least this is by far my most

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,629
favorite feature I know it

00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:13,379
expect you to do to read any of the

00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:16,560
small text but it's an HTML template

00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:20,120
with the old syntax and you you if you

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,889
could read it you have a hard time

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,220
finding all the sin taxes you need to

00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:28,709
fix how about this this is much better

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,660
right we have error markers to show you

00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:34,470
okay you have so many places you need to

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:37,709
to work on but you you don't need to do

00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:41,370
any of that we have quick fix it's

00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:44,160
seeing a vs color so it really depends

00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:48,269
on how fast you can click in a matter of

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,629
second I mean everything will be fixed

00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:52,999
for you

00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:55,980
so to recap before we go go to the demo

00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:59,999
we do reverse engineering of your

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:03,600
application so you can understand much

00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:06,209
better your existing application become

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,129
planning accordingly you can have the

00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:10,379
facts to back back up your estimate

00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:14,720
right and you can prioritize your

00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:18,529
upgrade and secondary we help you set up

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,269
hybrid application and then for each

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:28,769
component we help you upgrade the

00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:33,329
business logic and the HTML template so

00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:36,059
now I hope that with this tool egregious

00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:38,519
upgrade is manageable and it's doable

00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:42,899
many organizations are very afraid to

00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:46,199
take on this journey right and there are

00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:49,259
just too many risks involved but now I

00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:52,230
hope we have removed this fear so we can

00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:55,199
start getting to it it's still not and

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,480
for the automated process if you can

00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:59,429
click a button and this tool can do all

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:04,499
the migration for you I would have

00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:07,139
called it autopilot right but but you

00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:09,809
still need to fix the metal bodies for

00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:12,509
example but it's a lot easier for you

00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:14,550
just just to fix those faces instead of

00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:17,100
doing the things that you know it should

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,720
be done but you just need to manually do

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,620
the typing that that's not going to

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,100
scale

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:27,999
and this is the what one my son do for

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:31,779
me on his presentation and when I bumped

00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:33,759
into a bread last night and ng party he

00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:36,160
commented to me you guys came a long way

00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:39,819
and indeed we did we worked really hard

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,819
to make this two into this kind of a

00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:45,939
state and we are ready to tell the world

00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:48,699
about it we really worked hard but we

00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:51,100
didn't do it alone we had a lot of help

00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:53,559
from the angular team they gave us

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:57,370
constant feedback and it's now same to

00:13:53,559 --> 00:14:00,629
you for angular right since we're a half

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:03,699
years ago when $2.00 first came out

00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:06,220
anger has grown so much has been so much

00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:07,990
more well-rounded and it's taking us to

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,499
new frontiers that we never imagined

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,170
possible

00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:14,170
and I hope to convey the same message to

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:16,209
organizations you can actually do the

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:20,170
migration we will be there to help you

00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:22,509
we want you to be successful and so I

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,930
I'm not sure how much time I still have

00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:33,189
five minutes okay so I will do the demo

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:35,920
until the eye reaches net time so the

00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:40,559
first thing I have to demo is the this

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:48,370
syntax fix right so I'm looking at that

00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:52,149
yes let me do this will this be better

00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:55,170
well well okay the point is not to read

00:14:52,149 --> 00:15:00,040
the text right as I said so you have

00:14:55,170 --> 00:15:05,500
this many fixing you need to do you take

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:09,569
up the crepe fix remove remove all these

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:12,750
can choose fix all fixable problems

00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:12,750
there go

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:25,100
thank you and I'll see if I can do the

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,949
scaffolding in the remaining like four

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,699
minutes so we are looking at the angular

00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:34,339
foam CAD application the demo angry gia

00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:37,639
certification from the angular team so

00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:40,519
click on the upgrade button and we pick

00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:46,069
the directory where we want a new

00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:50,680
project to be and what it does is it

00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:54,680
imported the source code and created the

00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,629
skeleton angular CI project right so we

00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,209
set up C angry see how I you don't need

00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:00,920
to worry about doing that later on and

00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:03,139
you don't need to worry about any cop or

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,629
any of your previous build and then this

00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:08,029
is the wizard I was talking about we

00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:11,839
have five steps first step is tell us

00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:16,699
your angularjs source we imported into

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:19,910
this project and then we can go ahead

00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:22,310
and install the NPM packages where we

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:26,120
call these packages it's some of them

00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:27,800
were the angry angry CI dependencies

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,519
like angular dependencies but the

00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:34,339
projects tab we have all the

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,110
dependencies ported from a poet JSON

00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:38,569
if you don't have that file you can

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,699
create one to tell this to help us along

00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:43,730
but if you don't want to do that you can

00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:49,610
click on the Add button and add your

00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:52,519
dependency one by one and if this is did

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:55,389
I click on install install or you know I

00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:59,660
think I did and we can look at the

00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:05,000
directories in a new project we have a

00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:07,490
source - ng one that's your angry s and

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,350
we have a source that's your angry see I

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,350
created ones and

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:20,030
it's still installing I didn't have the

00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:22,429
network but then the next step we help

00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:24,530
you configure so the party libraries for

00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:28,100
example this project had dependency on

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:31,040
bootstrap we need to add the CSS it had

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:35,360
the dependency on jQuery we need to add

00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:39,260
the JavaScript file so here we will

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,780
actually have a bunch of patents for the

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,160
popular third-party libraries you click

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,410
on these buttons and it will be

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,169
automatically configured for you and

00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:51,260
then the fourth step we allow you to add

00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:54,530
additional stylesheet she's global style

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:57,140
sheets global scripts or assets for

00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:01,580
example in this case we have the phone

00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:04,880
images the JSON files for the phone

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:07,669
definitions and that's the chance to add

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,320
these and once you're done we're done

00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,400
with the installation so how many

00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,640
minutes do we have now

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:18,590
I think I can get this done in probably

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:23,299
two minutes okay all right so scripts as

00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:25,940
I said we had we had a jQuery already

00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:29,990
added right after I click on the button

00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:34,130
and style sheet I haven't put bootstrap

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:40,460
already and I have to I need it

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:45,740
sorry waiting to around folder to global

00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:57,380
style sheets and hi I have two asset

00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:59,390
folders phones and images and we're done

00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,910
with these settings so the finished

00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,130
pattern will actually do all the code

00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:07,340
generation for you it's sorry that it's

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:14,419
already done the click on the link the

00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:18,169
packing vs code now that's wrong and you

00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:19,970
serve so why this is compiling we can

00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:23,950
look at the files we touched

00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:28,210
we touched angry CRTs and we touched

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:31,029
PGs on main tortillas index file and a

00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,510
whole bunch of these new modules that we

00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:36,880
migrated here form and go to je s

00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:39,360
because modules are super easy to just

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,289
might be over like it's the actual

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,080
components that are hot so in the

00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:51,659
company she is done okay now in the

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:51,659
moment I'll choose right sorry not 4200

00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:06,610
200 well see this message the famous

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:11,190
angular console output but it's running

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:11,190
angular but we look at this application

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,720
it's um

00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:20,769
get out how they smacked fighting

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:27,760
business it's working you can do

00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:29,710
filtering thank you yeah it looked easy

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,820
but actually a lot of work when you do

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:37,149
this as I said and at the end I have a

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:40,529
slide you don't need to worry about the

00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:45,010
links because it'll be available in the

00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:47,230
your ng app under the schedules you have

00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:50,139
a speaker slides I think the information

00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:52,450
will be available here and I look

00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:54,970
forward to hearing from you guys thank

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:58,559
you very much and now we know how we

00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,559
