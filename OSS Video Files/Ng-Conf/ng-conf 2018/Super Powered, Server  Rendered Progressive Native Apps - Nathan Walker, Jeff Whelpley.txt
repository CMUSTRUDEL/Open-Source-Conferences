hello my name is Jeff Whelpley I'm the

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,309
CTO and co-founder of swish and I'm a

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,349
Google developer expert and my name is

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,420
Nathan Walker co-founder of in-studio

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,930
and a native script expert

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,550
we are both so mind-blowing ly excited

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,390
to be here today talking about something

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,029
that we are very very passionate about

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,769
multi-platform development with angular

00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:31,380
now I know a lot of people in this room

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,660
have built native apps for iOS or

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,010
Android and a growing number of you have

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,309
started to build progressive web apps

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,309
for the web and I'm really really happy

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,730
to see that as one of the creators of

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,040
Angry

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,590
Universal more and more people building

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,450
server-side rendered apps and the great

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,010
thing about angular is that you can

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,399
build for each of these platforms

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,770
individually pretty easily the challenge

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,510
comes when you try to build one app that

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,289
targets all these platforms at the same

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,320
time it can be really difficult and the

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:06,570
primary reason for that is that each of

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,299
these platforms has a unique set of

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:13,020
superpowers that don't translate to the

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,420
other platforms and provide for the best

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,090
possible user experience on that

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,979
specific platform so for example amp is

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,990
a specification from Google that allows

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,810
you to build your website in a way that

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,270
Google will cash your entire website and

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,450
serve it instantly for mobile users

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,030
really good for SEO as well yes it is

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,479
great for SEO that gets you ranking much

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,430
higher than without it it doesn't work

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,220
with any client-side JavaScript it's

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,570
only server rendered content likewise

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,540
serviceworker works well on the web but

00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:51,180
not on the server at all and native API

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,030
is obviously neat a native app or a

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,979
plugin to work so when you're building

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,560
one app that targets all these platforms

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,770
you sort of have to make a choice either

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,420
you ignore all these superpowers and

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,759
build some generic app that is

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,149
essentially the least common denominator

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,649
of all these platforms which really

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,920
isn't an option for any real-world app

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,990
or

00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,430
you do something like this where you put

00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:20,180
a bunch of if conditional statements

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,830
hacks just get it working so that you

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,930
have this one kind of miss mash of a

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,819
code base and I think Nathan we've both

00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,680
done this a number of times this is

00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:30,170
really nasty we wouldn't recommend this

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,390
to anyone but we have done this yes just

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,810
to get it to get it working right but

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:38,360
it's not great and so Nathan I set on a

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,010
mission with this talk to put together a

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,890
combined knowledge and come up with a

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,420
better way to do this and to reiterate

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,540
sort of the challenge here it's

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,739
something where you have an a product

00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,049
that you're trying to target multiple

00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:53,000
platforms you want to use the

00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:56,150
superpowers of each of the Platt target

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,790
platforms and you want it to be simple

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,860
enough that you can grow the product

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,959
over time and you can have a big team

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,989
working on it without it being a crazy

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:10,060
ball mess that you kind of throw into

00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:12,470
the garbage and put on fire one day so

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,600
anything I've been iterating on a number

00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,819
of ideas for this trying out different

00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,920
prototypes and the final solution we've

00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:20,690
come up with I think we're both pretty

00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,600
happy with this has been a lot of fun

00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:27,170
so we're calling our solution X Platt

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,209
and it involves the four following four

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,470
things at kind of a high level and I'm

00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,880
just going to mention them kind of

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,670
briefly and Nathan's going to go into

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,560
them in more detail in a little bit so

00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,630
first of all it's built on top of

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,850
narwhals and X workspace which allows

00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:46,400
you to build which allows you to build

00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:49,340
multiple apps within one project in one

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,290
mono repo second is that for the apps

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,660
that you have in your workspace it's

00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,459
really important that they're as thin

00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,980
and small as possible that they're

00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:02,090
targeted to one one in only one platform

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:04,010
and ideally for one purpose and then you

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,170
have all of your shared platform

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,970
agnostic code within libs

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,000
so that's stuff that can run on any

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,910
platform but then you'll have a number

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,340
of a certain amount of shared code that

00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,840
is platform specific so for example you

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,850
might have three different native script

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,530
native script apps and you have a set of

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,840
plugins that you want to share among all

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,760
of your nature script apps so there's an

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,340
X plat directory where you put all the

00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,010
plateau

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:32,669
specific shared code and this is it this

00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,160
is a relatively simple idea but it took

00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:37,110
us a little while to get here part of

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,169
the point of X plot is to be unobtrusive

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,479
to n X we really love the core value of

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:44,190
n X the extensibility of it so we really

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,440
wanted to add something that lets you

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,680
extend it that you could also easily

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,080
detach later it's really a primary goal

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,930
yep definitely and we built a lot of

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,199
sample code using this type of setup but

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,180
you know one point I told Nathan we got

00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,660
to do more than this like we got to

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,729
build something really big a real-world

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,010
application a real-world product so that

00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:10,110
we can really demonstrate the awesome

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:13,410
power of what we've kind of conceived

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,510
here this is when a big light bulb went

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,270
off believe it or not an angular

00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:21,720
community member among us amazing artist

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:24,120
John nits vici is a sketch artist and

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,570
back in the fall I came across all these

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,550
cool sketches that he done from Orlando

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:31,229
angular mix and he's right now sketching

00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,590
all the talks he's been sketching every

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:36,630
single talk that's gone on today and you

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,100
know we wanted to do something with this

00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,240
back in the fall I said John you know

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,530
this would be really neat to do

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,280
something in the future I know what it

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,960
would be but that time came and so all

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,849
of you may have done things like these

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,190
obviously back in high school maybe a

00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:52,560
little bit grade school they're just a

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,690
fun way to give a light perspective also

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,130
can be really useful different

00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,919
perspectives from different peoples in a

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,900
very artistic way so this is an example

00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,240
from Annie McNally a kind of infamous

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,750
sketch artist does sketch art for Debbie

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,169
WDC for Apple and so we put together

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:12,990
this platform we built this entire

00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:15,810
service and what we wanted to do is we

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:19,050
wanted to build an iPad app specifically

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:21,270
designed for the Apple pen for artists

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,520
to be able to use on an iPad

00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,280
specifically this would be the primary

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,789
artistic vehicle that would deliver the

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,979
art to Android and iOS app and a PWA and

00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:36,419
so you could consume it on the device

00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:38,730
that you use all the time the platform

00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:41,910
we're calling sketch points

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:45,180
and angular was the tool to deliver all

00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:47,040
of these pieces now we didn't just write

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,320
code I mean this is we thought of this

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,380
as an actual product as if it was like a

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:56,060
real company so I mean we went all out

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,060
we made a promo video

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:43,839
[Music]

00:07:48,300 --> 00:08:11,580
[Music]

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:14,880
yes thank you

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,910
what's up let's get down to business so

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,280
let's look at the architecture that we

00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:23,010
really wanted to kind of get into the

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,380
details with so lives as we mentioned in

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,979
X you can develop any way with lives

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,760
that you want to when doing

00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:31,979
multi-platform development in particular

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,400
it's really nice we found out to keep

00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:37,440
the libs platform agnostic so what we

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,860
came up with is in our situation in this

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,779
particular application five ideal sets

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,050
in barrels that we could share from

00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:48,390
across all these platforms targets API

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,230
for our API services core for low-level

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,060
services

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:54,060
features which is all of our tags

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,950
details gatherings and events SAS for

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,200
shared style and themes across all of

00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,730
them and just simple utilities so in

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,279
your apps you're actually importing from

00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,589
for example at sketch point slash API

00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:09,089
but that's just pointing to a local file

00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:11,940
here in lips so as Jeff mentioned we

00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:15,240
have introduced X plat X plat is an

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,370
additive folder to NX for platform

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,709
specific functionality so this is

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:22,770
intended to be infinitely scalable for

00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:26,940
all sorts of platforms SSR for instance

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:29,130
electron this houses the platform

00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,500
specific implementation so native script

00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,270
components can go here TNS core modules

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,400
you can use all of that you can code

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,890
right against Objective C Swift and Java

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:41,810
and Kotlin right inside of this folder

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,950
the web is specifically for Dom

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:47,040
decorated components so this is

00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:49,620
obviously for the web this is a look at

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,870
the app target so we can see on the

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,450
right-hand side of the screen this is in

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:57,810
the viewer app this is an iOS app that

00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:59,459
lets people watch these sketches you can

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:03,120
actually download and check the mountain

00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:05,400
now on the left is the PWA so this is a

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,690
PWA providing the same functionality so

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,220
you don't even need to download an app

00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,890
you can just consume it right in the

00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:14,220
browser and this is of course sharing

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,990
the same functionality this is another

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,850
look this is the artist app this is

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,700
actually a completely different native

00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:23,940
app this is deployed as SP artist on the

00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:27,570
or and it provides the exact same routes

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,610
same configuration and everything but we

00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,770
allow the routes to be configured on a

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:34,080
per app basis so we can actually insert

00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:36,030
in a custom view for the artist which

00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,340
takes in a custom drawing plug-in to

00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:41,100
make this work and then on the left is

00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,660
actually SSR universal yeah and actually

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,370
this was something Gore had earlier

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,170
today that sort of line graph of the

00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,230
level of like work you want to put into

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:52,530
your SSR app and SEO and all that type

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:55,350
stuff this is like as far up into the

00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,120
left as you could possibly go so we

00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,250
actually put this out there like a

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,610
couple weeks ago it's already out

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,320
ranking most of the other sites for any

00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,180
keyword searches for most of these talks

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,220
if you search for any talk here you're

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:12,150
gonna see our sketch point site in the

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:14,430
top 1 to 3 of ranking so hopefully all

00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:18,650
the speakers get some nice artwork along

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:21,450
with their talks as well for forever

00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:24,810
let's talk about some of the advantages

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:27,720
of this type of architecture on the Left

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:31,920
we have a search feature that I built

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,600
originally on iOS only it doesn't matter

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,160
exactly where you start building a

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,440
feature that's the point in the

00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,600
advantage to the architecture chances

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,720
are if you build it in one place you can

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,400
share it everywhere so this search

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,500
feature that's it's just drilling down

00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,710
the events we want this on the PWA as

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,200
well so if we look at the code behind

00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:54,420
the search feature in native script for

00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,630
instance we have a search bar but we'll

00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:00,330
see something interesting the code is

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,640
just angular in rxjs so we have a

00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,800
component identifier and we have rxjs

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,600
bindings if you'll notice on the left

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,640
hand side of the screen this is an X

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,040
plat native script so of course we can

00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:16,290
use this particular component across the

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,790
artists app and the viewer app if we

00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,950
look a little further in the actual

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,220
component file we'll see that this is

00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:26,130
derived from a singular base component

00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:30,450
class this base component class happens

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:32,480
to be used also by the PWA what we can

00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:34,399
do is we can look at

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,579
all of the platform-agnostic code and

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,800
there's a lot here all we have is rxjs

00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:42,050
and we have a pipe that's wiring up that

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,540
search to basically do our search filter

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:47,149
on the list so we can take all that code

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,430
out and we can drop it down a level in

00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:51,350
this X flat architecture so we ran X

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,810
botton ativ script we're going to drop

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,699
it down into libs features down into the

00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,990
base component you see all the green

00:12:55,699 --> 00:13:02,149
code moves down so now we've already

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,250
completed this feature for the PWA all

00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:06,019
we have to do is just wire it to an

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,279
input control on them this is how you

00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,949
achieve when I was talking about earlier

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,720
of having each of your apps be very thin

00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:16,310
they really just contain the view your

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:19,040
HTML and some wiring of the data and all

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,779
of your ng RX and state logic and

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:26,570
everything is in libs is in the common

00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:28,670
logic so you can see here now the PWA

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,829
search feature works just the same and

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,720
it only took a matter of minutes

00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:35,930
in fact it's funny when I first did that

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,480
feature I think when we first showed a

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,560
little bit off to frosty and Joe they

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,730
were like you really need to be able to

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,800
search on there I was like well we

00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,269
already did the search feature on on iOS

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,079
so we just dropped it down and it was

00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:49,699
done for the PWA there is a little bit

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,730
of configuration to make all this work

00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:54,500
in a joyous fashion and in X so we

00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,410
wanted to make this a lot easier for

00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,720
folks to try out on their own and give

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:02,449
all this a spin so you can install the

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,670
in studio schematics this provides all

00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:08,389
the X flat tools in an in X workspace

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:11,870
again it's meant to be unobstructed so

00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:14,920
it really does not override anything

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:18,829
that NX provides at all NX works as is

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:21,110
it provides this one important generator

00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:23,089
this is the X pot generator it will

00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,699
generate a structure that you can

00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:28,519
immediately build a multi-platform setup

00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:30,139
up with like right out of the box so

00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:31,329
this will have a lot of best practices

00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:33,139
that we've learned over the years

00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:34,639
certainly all the best practices we

00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:38,449
learned in building this entire

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,220
application baked in it provides a

00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:43,160
native script generator so this is a

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,209
generator for NX for native script

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,170
several folks have

00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:47,369
asked me over the past couple months

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,410
about a generator there's been a

00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:50,999
template available for a while so this

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:55,610
provides a generator right out of the

00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:58,350
box inside of Enix specifically as

00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:00,269
mentioned in Ex generators work as is so

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:02,970
this is the app generator for a standard

00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:05,220
web app however we will enhance it to

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,679
take advantage of the full set up in Ex

00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,959
plat so it will be taking advantage of

00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:13,980
shared routes in the components and and

00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:15,449
all the shared services one of the

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,689
biggest problems we've run into I think

00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:20,819
Jeff and I both we adamantly agree on

00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:23,279
this when you start doing multi-platform

00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:25,639
development on large teams is clarity

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,290
and focus is a big problem

00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,490
developers can really get confused when

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,119
they see a platform they're not familiar

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,470
with so we really wanted to try to build

00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:39,149
something into this that would help

00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:41,160
improve that focus and clarity so with

00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:43,889
the expat tools you get this simple

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,610
generator no magic here this is just

00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:49,980
actually modifying the workspace to

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:52,049
drill down the platform just so you can

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,759
focus on whatever you want to work on so

00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:56,040
if you're in web mode and you want to

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,470
work on the PWA or you have a team of

00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,389
specialists who are specific for PWA and

00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,369
web you can have them drill the

00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:04,589
workspace down just work on the web

00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:05,879
features likewise

00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,740
you can also have native script

00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:09,929
specialists who are working on Android

00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,549
and iOS counterparts they can drill the

00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:16,949
workspace down and work on just those

00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:19,139
elements we also created a fun little

00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:21,059
tool with electron this is actually an

00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:23,790
automatically generated electron app

00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:26,399
that is built off of the X flat in X

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,410
workspace and it will automatically fill

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,879
up with the apps that you've created and

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,799
you can toggle between the different

00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:33,329
developer modes there's a lot more to be

00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,589
done with this we're really just having

00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:36,569
fun with this and would love to hear

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:39,269
some feedback on it and this seems

00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:40,740
pretty simple but it's I mean in all

00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:43,799
it's doing is showing and hiding folders

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:46,259
but like Nathan was saying when you do a

00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:49,079
multi-platform development it's really

00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:51,119
hard as a developer to keep in your mind

00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,949
at the same time all the little

00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:54,059
intricacies of each platform and

00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:56,819
considerations and everything like that

00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:57,410
so just this simple feature of just kind

00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:59,059
of like

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,999
in hiding files so that you can kind of

00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:04,250
focus is extremely beneficial we've been

00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:06,439
using this swish and it's definitely led

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,259
to a lot more productivity and feeling

00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,970
just like that more in control of your

00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:14,000
application this is also kind of a

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:16,610
precursor to electron support in X flat

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,259
so I've loved electron for years and I'd

00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,730
love to build electron support directly

00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:22,309
an X plot so this kind of provides a

00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,889
path forward so as you can see like we

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:28,580
built a lot of stuff for this talk right

00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:30,980
and we haven't even gotten into a lot of

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,049
the other details of sketch points we

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,340
built a full stack app here and we have

00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:39,049
probably of enough material for like

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:41,659
four or five hour long talks but since

00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:44,240
we only have 20 minutes here we have

00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:46,580
published a snapshot of all the sketch

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,000
points code so that after this talk you

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:52,669
can go and get into the details and see

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,460
exactly how we're wiring up all this

00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:57,860
stuff this is a pared down snapshot by

00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,590
the way sketch points has ability to

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,929
donate and actually buy badges that you

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,610
can give to sketch artists so if you

00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,740
like the art that you see you can

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,600
purchase these coins to redeem for

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,850
badges to give to these artists all the

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,200
purchases that are done during ng-conf

00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,649
is going to be given to women who code

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,240
so we'd love to see some of that but you

00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:19,100
can become an artist yourself as well

00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,320
but we did want to control the quality

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,029
so it's $0.99 to unlock each channel

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,309
again those proceeds go to women who

00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:26,600
code and if you want to get started on

00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:30,860
your own project you can go to end

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,029
studio do /x Platte and we have a lot of

00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,840
people to think I mean it wasn't just

00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:38,629
Nathan and I we had a lot of help for a

00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:41,419
huge thank you Tim did the design for

00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:44,450
the server rendered app so I definitely

00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:46,730
thanks to everyone here and I want to

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:49,730
personally thank Nathan you know we had

00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,950
this crazy idea months ago and it was

00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:54,529
amazing working with him on this project

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,210
to seeing all the amazing stuff that you

00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:58,909
but he said we had this crazy idea was

00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:01,559
all his idea but no thank you very much

00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:05,469
I really appreciate it

00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:09,999
yeah oh one more thing one more thing

00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:14,109
actually I tried I almost forgot so ex

00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:16,659
plat and sketch points in my mind is the

00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:19,479
culmination of so much work within the

00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:20,529
angular community and it's something

00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:23,529
where I don't think we could have done

00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:24,969
this a year ago right like there's so

00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,489
much innovation that's going on here so

00:19:24,969 --> 00:19:29,789
much hard work by with an angular core

00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:32,589
team within all of you by all of you and

00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:35,049
sketch points is sort of a reflection of

00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:36,549
the power of angular and so I think

00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:39,159
there's an opportunity here to do

00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:41,409
something you know really special we

00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:44,079
posted sketch points on product hunt

00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:45,249
this morning and I know that a lot of

00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,799
you probably don't even know what

00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:50,139
product hunt is but you have to trust me

00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:52,299
that if you can get a product to hit

00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:55,769
number one on the daily trending list

00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:58,209
it's a really really big deal now

00:19:55,769 --> 00:20:00,959
currently we need about five hundred

00:19:58,209 --> 00:20:02,879
votes to get number one there are

00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:05,079
fifteen hundred people in this room

00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:08,649
there aren't thousands of people

00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:10,029
watching on the livestream I see some of

00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:12,429
you with your phones thank you very much

00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:15,039
this would be cool this is really to put

00:20:12,429 --> 00:20:17,829
an angular product built solely with

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,659
angular up to the top of product hunts

00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:22,029
list it'd be pretty cool definitely

00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:23,529
let's work together get this to be

00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:26,559
number one and show the rest of the

00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:29,349
world the power of angular and the power

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:32,159
of the angular community thank you guys

00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:32,159
thank you

00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,210
