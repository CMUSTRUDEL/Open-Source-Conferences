kind of applause for Tara's sparkly

00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:09,860
jacket that's just awesome so two

00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,709
minutes isn't really enough time to talk

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:16,609
about our product so I'm gonna introduce

00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:17,780
it by way of a metaphor so a union

00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:19,820
representative was walking by a

00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,260
construction site and he saw that there

00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,090
was an excavator it was digging out the

00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,280
basement of the construction site he's

00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:27,530
outraged and he goes to find the foreman

00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,090
of the site he says that's terrible why

00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,380
using that excavator 100 men with

00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,379
shovels could be digging that basement

00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,239
out and the foreman thinks about it from

00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:39,710
it he says well that's true but why not

00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:42,680
a thousand men with teaspoons so it

00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,880
wasn't that funny but yeah I said it

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,790
wasn't metaphor I didn't say it was a

00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,780
joke so the point is that like yes you

00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,100
can dig out the basement with the

00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,690
teaspoons but why would you want to when

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,890
there's excavators available to help you

00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,809
because your goal is really to get the

00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,120
building constructed we happen to have a

00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:57,920
couple of those excavators and we'll be

00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,270
