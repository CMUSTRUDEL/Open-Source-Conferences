we're supposed to wear 80s outfits today

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,440
and I didn't bring one

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,150
so let me strap my 80s costume on later

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,330
I'm gonna put Google clusters in this in

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,480
this fanny pack or is it a belly bag who

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,010
knows a googoo cluster oh it's a

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,480
marvelous piece of candy so if you see

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,789
me I'll have googoo clusters later and

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,490
t-shirts you want to get that this

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,510
sessions called BS code can do that

00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,740
today we're gonna look at some of the

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,119
things that you might not know about

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,890
visual studio code and this is the

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,500
angular edition of this talk so I've

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,200
tailored it just for you fine angular

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,090
folks here it's gonna be a lot of fun

00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:43,260
now before we do that I'd like to take

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:46,620
you back really quickly to 2012 the year

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,640
is 2012 the number one song on the radio

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,039
is a song called rolling in the deep' by

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,620
Adele she didn't write this song she

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,059
remade this on the number one movie at

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,420
the box office is a movie called drive

00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:06,090
with that remarkable Canadian Ryan

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,340
Gosling fantastic movie yes give it up

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,450
for Ryan Gosling it's okay yeah it feels

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,689
good it feels good Barack Obama is

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:20,600
President easy easy easy

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:23,580
okay everybody relax and that same year

00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,009
Microsoft puts out a small press release

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,720
that nobody reads and that press release

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,829
says that they've hired a gentleman

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:36,000
named Eric gamma from IBM and he set up

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:38,790
a new office in Zurich Switzerland and

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,829
that's it a small blurb a small press

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,299
release and nobody thinks anything about

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,899
it

00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:48,299
life goes on over the next several

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,070
months and years Eric and his team in

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,320
Zurich begin working on developer

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,299
tooling that's built in a browser based

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,759
in a browser this is called project

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,009
Minako and project Minako begins to show

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,950
up in some interesting places such as

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:05,490
the browser developer tools the embedded

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,399
CLI in Azure and eventually becomes

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,899
Visual Studio code now I tell you that

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,459
story because there's something

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,270
interesting in as Paul Harvey would say

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,250
the rest of the story Eric

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,380
gamma is famous for something else prior

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,440
to Visual Studio code does anybody know

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:24,930
what that is

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:28,720
Gang of Four yes but he also invented

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,730
Eclipse I heard it the same person who

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,510
invented Eclipse has also given us vs

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:40,720
code and that my friends is called

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:42,760
redemption all right let's get started

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,110
you could follow me here on Twitter I'd

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,970
appreciate if you do that my self-esteem

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,800
is low and I would like to maintain more

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,690
followers than my coworker asome here

00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,680
I'd like to thank Microsoft for letting

00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,630
me come out and do this

00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,400
I do work on the Azure team and I get to

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,380
work closely with the visual studio code

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,640
team I'd like to think that they like me

00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,430
I don't know that that's necessarily

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,410
true so perhaps that qualifies me to

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,050
give this presentation now the first

00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:08,080
thing that you'll notice is that my

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:10,510
setup here is I have a light theme and

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,070
I've heard a lot of comments about dark

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,600
themes Todd motto said once that

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,310
according to science

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,410
lud light themes are not good for your

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,760
eyes if that's the case for you

00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,959
you can of course pick a different theme

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:27,070
it might be interesting to know that the

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,810
most scientifically speaking best theme

00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,240
for your eyes is one called cobalt 2

00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:34,060
from West boss this is the case because

00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,310
your eyes do best with bright yellow

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,580
text on a dark blue background it's

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,980
easiest on your eyes me personally I'm

00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,690
not its 2018 so we don't let science or

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,700
facts get in the way of anything that we

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,830
do so I'm going to be sticking with my

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,770
light theme and you all can go ahead and

00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,820
be wrong with your dark things

00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,490
now the other thing that I would like to

00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,230
tell you is that there is something that

00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:00,160
you can do inside a visual studio code

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,570
called font ligatures so we're actually

00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,060
going to tweak our font a little bit

00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,080
let's open up a file here I'm going to

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,000
go through and use some keyboard

00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,770
shortcuts today I'm gonna try to shout

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,670
out what they are don't worry about that

00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,620
when we get to the end of this

00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,239
presentation you'll have seen a dozens

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,980
of things you won't remember any of them

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,660
I'm gonna give you one URL where you can

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,799
go and get all of this information later

00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,060
and look at it at your own time so let's

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,250
take a look at a file here I'm just

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,160
gonna pull up tell you what let's look

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,770
at the artist component here

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,570
and here's not just a little bit of code

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,360
super impressive code of course because

00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:36,000
I wrote it but we can go over and we can

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,010
install a font called Fira code and this

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,540
is from github you can just install this

00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,460
and then you you double-click the font

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,840
file you hope to god there's not a virus

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,910
in there and then now it's on your

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,620
machine and now that you have this font

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:49,950
installed you can use it inside a Visual

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,320
Studio code but it's not just any font

00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,860
it's a font ligature so what does that

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,240
mean

00:04:52,860 --> 00:05:00,330
well you can come to your user settings

00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:03,240
here and you can add in some settings

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,700
here let's go back let me pull these out

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,280
and actually I'm going to just copy and

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,910
paste so we don't have to so look at

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,600
this let's go back here and you can set

00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:21,180
editor font family here and you can just

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:24,600
set this to fear a code like this and

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,210
then you can set editor dot font

00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,360
ligatures right here you're just gonna

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:34,620
set this to true and now when I click

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,780
Save you'll notice that my font changes

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,990
a little bit and that's not that's not

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,790
right here oh space there thank you so

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,340
much perfect all right so now for your

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,930
code is working that's just a font not

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,520
that impressive but check this out if we

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,560
come back to the artist component and

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,120
let's take a look at something like if

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,710
we were to right look at this little

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,830
arrow right here now instead of a double

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,690
arrow we have an actual double arrow an

00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,820
actual fat arrow so what it does is it

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,440
takes multiple symbols that we use to

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,300
specify one symbol and it makes listen

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,060
to one so for instance you could have

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,620
something like an equals equals and you

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,840
get an equals equals or even better

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,890
equals equals equals and you get an

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,500
actual triple equals yes it's okay you

00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,550
can give it up for the triple equals

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,730
it's beautiful we're just getting

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,930
started okay wonderful another thing

00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,780
that I'd like to talk to you about is

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,850
Emmett now take it easy a lot of you are

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,110
like Emmett come on I know it Emmett is

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,800
you said this was gonna be all the

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,670
things I didn't know about vs code well

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,990
there's always people in the room that

00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,250
don't know Emmett because we're all at

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,919
different levels and that's perfectly

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,600
fine but for those of you who do know

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,990
Emmett there are some things you may not

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,530
know that

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:45,750
can do so let's open up the artist

00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,430
component here and I'm just going to go

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,120
to BH I tell you what let's do different

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:53,700
ones do player a component HTML and in

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,690
here we can use image to create markup

00:06:53,700 --> 00:07:00,870
very quickly so for instance we could do

00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:03,510
something like this and this will give

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,130
us a bootstrap navbar now scientifically

00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,570
speaking you cannot build an application

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,950
without bootstrap so you're going to

00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,050
want to put bootstrap navbar in your

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,400
application now once we've done this we

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,110
can hit tab and this will actually

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,250
expand out and then we have tab stops

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:20,520
here and we can go and put home about

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,560
contacts you get the idea so you don't

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,790
need to know all of the image shortcuts

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,010
or syntax you just need to know the

00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,690
visual studio code can do this now for

00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,940
those of you who are like I knew that

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:35,610
okay easy check this out let's say

00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:38,700
you've got something simple like an

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,530
image and you are going to add in your

00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,180
image source here that's nice

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,940
get a picker inside of us code this is

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,790
why we love via scope scope one more go

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:51,210
to the assets and images and let's do

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:53,010
the let's do the banner here this one up

00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,810
top alright so now we've got an image in

00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,070
our project but you don't just want to

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,630
put an image in your project you want to

00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,310
specify the width and the height so that

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,960
the browser can reserve space for your

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,120
image well how do you know how big this

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,500
image is well one of the ways is to just

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,560
click on the image and visual studio

00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,840
code will tell you or or you can just

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,200
come to the end of the line here said

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,290
space command shift P say update image

00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,790
size and boom visual studio code will do

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,800
it for you you don't even have to do it

00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,450
yourself check that out even more

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:27,210
interesting check this out let's start

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:32,970
over again here this works for remote

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:34,920
images as well boom it can pull in

00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,400
automatically image sizes right off the

00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,080
internet

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,580
very cool here's another thing you can

00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,580
do math

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,370
legitimate math we just hit math Marth

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,040
is not a thing

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,330
how about math boom right so you don't

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,550
need a calculator anymore and this is

00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,990
all powered by Emmitt so that's Emmitt

00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,400
inside a Visual Studio code everybody

00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,750
should know about MA because there's a

00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,420
lot of really cool productivity things

00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,320
that you can do with that

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,450
excellent so let's go ahead and take a

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,910
look at some more angular specific

00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,440
things here first of all I want to talk

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,030
about something called prettier now

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,920
prettier is an extension that you can

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,940
get from the gallery the extension

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,830
gallery and what it's going to do for

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,050
you is it's going to automatically

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,430
format your code so did you come in here

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,410
and you're typing a lot of times we're

00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,850
like man I got this line of code but I

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,470
don't know like maybe it should all be

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,390
on the same line and then you're like

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,800
nah I'm gonna put the VIN on the next

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,330
line I'm going to tab it out everybody's

00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,190
doing it differently you know you have a

00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,480
crisis an existential crisis because you

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,960
don't know how to format this line of

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,030
code

00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,500
well what prettier does is prettier says

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,300
don't worry I'm gonna take care of it

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,730
for you so you just hit command shift P

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,130
format document and prettier

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,680
automatically formats your code now this

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,450
is remarkable because check out all the

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,450
things that can do if you come over to

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:54,260
this tell you what let's go ahead and

00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:56,870
save this file let's look at a file here

00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,190
the iTunes Service file now this file

00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,560
has got a lot of squigglies in it

00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,520
because it's got double quotes somebody

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,260
check this file in with double quotes

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,180
look at where they're breaking the

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,730
braces here on the next line and there's

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,590
no semicolons in this file all pie

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,960
eyeballs all right

00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,140
who checked this file and this is a this

00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:18,110
is a disaster let's check this out

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:20,540
view file history oh crap it was me all

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:23,270
right so what we can do here is use

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,860
prettier to format this file so we're

00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:28,190
gonna do here is go command shift P

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,750
format document and boom quotes or

00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,490
change the single quotes semicolons are

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,530
put back in and now all the braces are

00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,150
on the right line now what's magical

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,580
about this is that if everyone on your

00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,800
team is looking is using prettier all of

00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,840
your code will be formatted the same no

00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,600
more arguments about tabs versus spaces

00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,980
its spaces prettier will take care of

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,780
that for you that is the answer so

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,820
that's prettier another things you can

00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,980
do is add a line to your settings file

00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,810
which will automatically format prettier

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,500
on save so that you don't have to select

00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:58,940
format document every single time

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,430
all right let's take a look at something

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,950
else that's really cool and that is John

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,000
Pappas angular essentials pack so it's

00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,380
right here if you don't have this

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,880
already installed how many people are

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,460
actually using angular essentials right

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,810
now couple hands go up okay it should be

00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,670
everybody in this room if you're using

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:16,220
angular and you're using vias code you

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:18,800
need to be using this with this you get

00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:22,940
snippets you get TS lint

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,280
you also get let's go ahead and get rid

00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:29,750
of this here

00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:31,910
don't save you also get the let's go to

00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:35,960
the artist file angular language service

00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:38,030
and that will actually compile your

00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,110
templates in the background so that you

00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,820
can get intellisense

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,230
and error checking while you're building

00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,810
your templates so for instance here we

00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,550
have a method called key up and we're

00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,550
calling a method called search and if we

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:51,260
put in searches we get a squiggly why do

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,630
we get a squiggly because there is no

00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,550
method called searches in the component

00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,920
file for this component so you know

00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,780
automatically at design time whether or

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,450
not your templates are valid you can

00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,670
also if we take this back you can just

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,740
right click search go to definition and

00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:09,050
boom you just jump right to the

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,940
corresponding definition in your file so

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,860
this is a really really powerful tool

00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,630
for moving between your templates and

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,690
your code and checking your templates at

00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:20,930
design time another thing vs code can do

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,000
is intellisense now you probably already

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,380
knew that let's go ahead and cancel out

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,180
of this without saving but what you may

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,140
not know is all the places that it can

00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,570
do intellisense

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,870
so let's go to package.json and you'll

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:35,180
see here oh i'm using angular for that's

00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:37,040
messed up that should be angular 5.2

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,300
well we know that from looking at the

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,410
other packages but what if we didn't

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,480
know what the current version of this

00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,740
package was we wanted to update it well

00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,630
just different ways we could do this we

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,640
could argue about academically whether

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,770
or not you should be manually changing

00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:53,270
your package JSON file but if we take

00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:54,890
this out check this out control space vs

00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,360
code goes out to NPM and it

00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:59,090
automatically tells you with the latest

00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,310
version of this packages no more going

00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,900
to NPM to try to figure out what your

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:05,420
package versions our visual studio code

00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,250
will just tell you because it provides

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,620
intellisense inside a package JSON files

00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,470
which is magical

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,550
let's fix this alright the other thing

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,800
that we want to talk about here is

00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,330
debugging so you can debug your angular

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,660
apps in the browser which you probably

00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:21,160
do with that with the chrome dev tools

00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,820
but you can also do bug them inside a

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:28,510
Visual Studio code so to do that you'll

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:31,870
come up here hit the debug hit the gear

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:34,510
and we'll select chrome and by default

00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,670
here we'll get a launch Chrome against

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,770
localhost and what this does is it

00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,990
literally just launches chrome now it's

00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,120
going to port 8080 but we want it to go

00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,740
to port 4200 and I should note that I

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,070
already have this project running in the

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,120
background so we're at port 4200 here

00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,180
and then the other thing we want to do

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,670
is add another configuration for Chrome

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,710
and it's going to be attached so we're

00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,910
going to launch Chrome against localhost

00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,000
and I'm actually gonna move this up

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:04,780
because we're gonna launch first like

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,250
this up we're gonna launch and then

00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:10,440
attach let me grab this and move this

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:15,430
down a little bit let's see there we go

00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,630
whoa made it that was scary all right so

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,640
we're gonna launch and then attach so

00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,560
let's do that I'm gonna save this so

00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,180
let's go here and we'll just say launch

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,470
Chrome against local hosts so we'll do

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,570
that and what that will do is actually

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,280
load a browser window for us so there it

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,260
is and then we're gonna come back and

00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:34,660
we're going to just attach to Chrome and

00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:35,590
this will attach the debugger there it

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,630
is right there so you can see we got

00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,220
both processes running we got three I

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,140
hit it twice we got three processes

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,060
running this is some sort of a new feat

00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:45,640
here and then we can add in a breakpoint

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,500
so if we go over to our so here's our

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,300
application here and what this does is

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,450
allows us to search for things inside of

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:55,060
the inside of iTunes so let's look for

00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:57,480
something let's look for I don't know

00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:01,720
what's some great 80s music shout it out

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:04,270
Duran Duran ooh how do you spell that -

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,250
Duran's wonder and followed by a second

00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,530
Duran alright we'll go to the greatest

00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,050
hits and then we could we can play these

00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:12,190
and these will actually play inside the

00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,560
browser here and show us an audio

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,180
visualization but what we can do is come

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,630
back over let's go to our iTunes file

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:21,340
which we've so Loveleen formatted and

00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,310
fixed with prettier here and if we come

00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,760
down we can add a

00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:26,180
great point here on the get tracks right

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,470
there

00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:34,180
oops maybe I'm in the wrong session here

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:37,220
let's try again alright so my

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:39,560
breakpoints let's go ahead and restart

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,720
will clear our breakpoints try again I

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,040
tell you what let me go back to the

00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,050
application and take a look at something

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,410
let's go ahead and not detach this looks

00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:51,080
like we're restarting demo fails so

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:56,240
awkward let's try that again what do we

00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:58,550
say Duran Duran Duran and I'm just going

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,170
to try to play now we're breaking

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,210
perfectly so now we're good and we can

00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,370
go in and we can look at the value of

00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,660
album ID or do any other debugging so

00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,370
you can debug in Chrome and there's

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,200
nothing wrong with that but you can also

00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,700
do bug inside a visual studio code and I

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,080
think you'll find that debugging in the

00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,589
same place where you compose your code

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,940
is a much better experience so that's

00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:19,700
cool let's go ahead and clear all our

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:22,910
breakpoints here we'll just go ahead and

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,850
continue on and then if we're going to

00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:31,390
just play this right here view to a kill

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:38,150
that's a good one another demo fail okay

00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:39,350
this is so awkward let me do this let's

00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:43,820
go

00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:50,680
I don't does anybody just you just shout

00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:50,680
it out if you see it you see it where I

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:57,910
can you just fix it for me yeah just fix

00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,910
it for me

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:07,920
oh what a silly and simple mistake I

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,920
have made

00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:22,690
can you go ahead and save it - I mean

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:26,589
since you're in there alright let's go

00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:31,960
back and see if we're working now -

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:37,130
dorrance yet we're still break-in let's

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:39,060
go back alright

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,980
[Music]

00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:45,010
that is called Visual Studio code live

00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:47,320
share and that's in preview you can sign

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,720
up for early access and it supports more

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,390
than one person at one time everybody

00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,190
give Brian Clark here in the front row

00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,490
round of applause for helping me out

00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,490
with that

00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,790
that is super exciting stuff so that's

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,620
coming soon no more pair of debugging

00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:08,450
sessions over Skype that is awesome

00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:10,070
alright let's talk about docker for a

00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,270
second now if I say doctor and your eyes

00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,230
roll back in your head and a little bit

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,790
of drool comes out the side of your

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,620
mouth it's okay I feel that way too

00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,440
right like the next person that says

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,880
docker you know come on please I think

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,910
we should have a moratorium on words

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,840
like docker kubernetes blockchain we

00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,850
shouldn't we yell loud to say those

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,320
things anymore if you don't understand

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,360
what docker is just know that it's like

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,430
an exe for your server application it's

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,870
a it's a package and you put all your

00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,360
dependencies in there and you put it

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:37,250
about on the server and it just works so

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,560
in this case for this project we want to

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,930
docker eyes this thing well how do we do

00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,460
that well we have the docker extension

00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,630
and it's all for visual studio code and

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,370
I'm going to open the sidebar so you can

00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,380
see this thing work here so we're just

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,540
going to do a command shift P and we're

00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:55,610
gonna say docker add docker files to

00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:57,440
workspace let's try that again add dr.

00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,000
files to workspace there it is at the

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,890
top and this is going to go through and

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,290
ask us what our platform is I'm just

00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,030
gonna say other for now port 3000 this

00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,710
is gonna add in all the docker files we

00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,500
need I'm gonna come to this docker file

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,700
I'm just gonna remove this and put in a

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,010
simple docker file that I've had here

00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,450
this just all it's doing is pulling in

00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,790
our build folder adding in the

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,650
Simplenote HTTP server and creating a

00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:22,990
container that's it so now that we've

00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:25,190
got this we can say docker compose up

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,190
specify the compose file and it will

00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:32,600
begin to compose this image here and

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:34,520
then we'll see that right here there

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,340
inside of our images inside of the

00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,990
docker panel so now we can say tag this

00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,850
image so we'll go ahead and tag it

00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:44,060
this will tag it and now we can

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:46,790
right-click it and say push it and this

00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:49,340
will push it up to docker hub let's try

00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,750
that one more time push excellent so

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,610
this will push it up to doctor hub and

00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,250
from doctor hub you can pull it into any

00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:58,820
cloud provider providers like Asher

00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:00,039
Asher or even azor you can use all three

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,480
of those

00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,830
so I've got so much more to show you but

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,780
I'm completely out of time we could

00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,429
literally do this all day I told you

00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,470
that I've got a resource for you it's

00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:11,450
called vs code can do that calm

00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,580
everything that we've gone over here is

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,159
it little tiny minute or less snippets

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,720
for you to watch at your leisure and I'd

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,120
like to thank Sarah ander for helping me

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,390
put this together thank you so much for

00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,949
coming

00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,949
