Title: How to Learn Anything 5X Faster | ng-conf & Thinkster.io | #ngconf
Publication date: 2020-11-04
Playlist: Webinars
Description: 
	Join ng-conf for EnterpriseNG, the world's first enterprise-focused Angular conference of its size! Nov 19-20, 2020 | Online. www.ng-conf.org! 

It's been proven that you're learning five times slower than you need to. All the tutorials, blogs, YouTube videos...you're consumingÂ all of it five times longer than you need to in order to learn it all effectively. If your time has no value to you, then there's no problem. But if you have important things to do, then learning more effectively is a critical skill to obtain.

In this webinar, Joe Eames breaks down how to learn skills - any skills - more effectively to get 5 times as much knowledge out of your study than you currently are.

ng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.

[Applause]

00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,549
[Music]

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,000
i want to talk about

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,800
basically just education in general

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,439
learning any learning five times faster

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,480
and this is really targeted at uh

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,199
programmers

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,640
who are already past the school stage

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,559
and trying to keep up to date or at the

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,320
tail end of the school stage and for

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,200
some of and so this is

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,000
definitely applicable in school stage as

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,520
well

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,879
but what it's like talking about

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,120
doing your own education right being in

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,160
charge of your own education versus

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,840
when you're in primary school or um

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,280
even university you kind of have your

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,320
education sort of

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
mapped out somewhat and you're in a

00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,399
teacher

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,079
student setting but once we get beyond

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,520
that how do we continue to learn and

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,280
that's very important for programmers

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,159
right we all have to learn and we all

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,040
have to learn

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,960
the faster we can learn the better that

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,680
is a really really really key point here

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,680
is that

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,520
as a programmer we're all well paid

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,400
programming is a

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,439
an industry that pays very well so

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,520
whether you are

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,040
already a programmer or you are on your

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,240
path to become a programmer

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,479
being a programmer you are well paid so

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,920
therefore your time is your time becomes

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,320
very valuable from a

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,240
a monetary standpoint the more

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,360
effectively you can learn the faster you

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,520
can learn

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,960
the better it is for you right because

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
it minimizes the amount of time that you

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,439
waste learning

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
and maximizes the amount of time that

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,799
you can spend applying that learning and

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,479
um applying that into making

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,840
money to support yourself and your

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,880
family

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,280
so learning faster is very important for

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,399
programmers plus the fact that

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,799
programming is possibly the industry

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,360
that

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,880
moves the fastest of all industries

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,560
there's

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,560
developments are just coming breakneck

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,000
speed especially in the front end world

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,080
and so there's always something new to

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,280
learn and it gets very overwhelming so

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,520
learning how to learn

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,800
those sorts of things faster and by the

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,640
end of this uh

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,920
webinar what i will do is actually map

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,920
out for you a plan

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,080
right follow this plan and you will

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,080
learn in general five times

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,520
faster than what is what you're doing

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,800
right now

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,720
uh or what you're what you're

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,000
experiencing right now but i'm also

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,520
going to go through and explain

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,599
what the problem is and the science

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,760
behind everything and

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,040
and why this is why this is an issue and

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,480
why um

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,440
it's possible to see such huge increases

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,319
in the amount of time it takes to learn

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,319
um or huge decreases in the amount of

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,360
time it takes to learn if you apply the

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,800
proper science and

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,319
i listed here i learned anything five

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,080
times faster but the reality is it can

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,879
be as much as ten times faster depending

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,319
on

00:02:52,879 --> 00:03:00,000
different factors so um

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,239
let's go through this here so this is

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,080
what what the experience is now once you

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,200
already again i'm talking of

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,959
if you're already a programmer and you

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,080
are already um you're past the primary

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,920
education or secondary education stage

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,040
or if you're teaching yourself if you're

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,599
learning to become a programmer but

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,280
you're kind of

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,440
it's very self-directed this is

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,519
essentially what goes on right now

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,959
so first you might watch a conference

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,760
talk or two about some topic

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,120
some item that you really want to learn

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,560
and once you watch those

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,080
that conference talk or two and they

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,720
show you how to code something up you

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,879
you'd say

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,319
wow that was awesome i loved getting to

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,040
see how to do that thing

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,480
but man i don't remember anything that

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,959
they talked about or at least how to do

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,040
it but i remember the fact that you can

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,959
so then you may go and you start looking

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,680
at blogs or a blog comes up in some feed

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,280
or something

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,200
oh there's a blog and you end up reading

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,319
a blog two blogs five blogs about the

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,920
topic 10 blogs

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,280
and every time you read the blog you

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,480
feel like i'm getting it a little bit

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,080
better but i still don't

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,760
really feel comfortable with the topic

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,080
yet right i'm not quite ready to go off

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,319
and try doing this on my own

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,920
and then you end up saying all right i'm

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,599
gonna finally i'm gonna buckle down i'm

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,920
really gonna learn this i'm gonna go

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,599
take a course so i'll go over to one of

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,400
the many places where you can subscribe

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,000
and take a course

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,920
so you take a course and at the end of

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,560
that course you think

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,680
i'm still not quite there i still don't

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,880
feel comfortable with it

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,400
but there's this other course i just

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,680
found out about you know like the ads

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,240
came up when i googled

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,520
blah blah you know courses on whatever

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,280
and so this ad came up for another

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,040
course and i'll bet that course

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,560
that will get me there and so you watch

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,759
to go through that sega course and then

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,199
you're still not quite comfortable and

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,960
finally watch the third course

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,320
by the time you're all done with all of

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,400
this sort of stuff

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,919
one of two things happens either you

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,880
start to feel comfortable enough and

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,960
start

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:51,919
um implementing it or most likely

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,919
the result is that you still feel lost

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,160
and that's the experience that many

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,759
programmers and a lot of

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,199
a lot of programmers have and this

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,720
varies from instance to instance but

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,440
this is the experience that we get all

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,720
the time

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,320
when trying to uh learn something as we

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,880
go and consume all this material still

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,560
at the end

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,960
you still don't feel comfortable with

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,560
whatever it is you're trying to learn

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,720
and there's a lot of effects of this

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,720
process of this going through and

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,479
going through a ton of different content

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,360
and still not end up feeling comfortable

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,280
with the with

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,639
with the topic at the end first off it

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,120
could be very demotivating

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,240
right you're watching this stuff over

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,280
and over again you really want to start

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,000
applying it but

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,520
you get very demotivated uh because

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,440
you're spending a lot of time and energy

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,360
trying to get through this

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,639
so and that you can also end up feeling

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,479
stupid right

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,320
you see you know that everybody else is

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,520
already already knows this topic maybe

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,199
the other people on your team

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,720
are more comfortable with it or the

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,320
people that you're seeing online

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,600
they're experts in this they've got it

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,800
down pat and you're trying to learn it

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,840
you just can't learn it and you might

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,120
end up feeling

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,520
like you're maybe you're just not as

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,160
smart as other people which is you know

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,000
then that sets into comparison i'm not

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,600
i'm not as good at learning as other

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,120
people i learn slower than other people

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,199
i have to go slower

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,880
and this comparison sits in maybe i'm

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,560
not as good of a programmer and i'll

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,280
never be as good of a programmer as

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,240
such and such other person right and in

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,720
my

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,639
25 years as a developer i've definitely

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,199
heard many times people saying

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,720
i learn slower than other people but um

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,479
you know eventually i do learn stuff i

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,319
hear that all the time

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,600
which i actually think is very incorrect

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,639
i don't think that they learn slower

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,560
than other people

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,479
in general but they presume that they do

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,039
because they compare

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,479
their their pace of learning to the pace

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,000
of learning of other to where other

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,680
people are already at right

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,840
it's a little bit like getting out onto

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,400
the uh soccer pitch and comparing

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,759
yourself

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,800
to uh uh well

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,720
pele's not playing anymore but um uh

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,840
ronaldo right here's this there's this

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,360
expert that's already out there and

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,960
you're trying to learn and follow along

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,240
and and do what they do and you're it's

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,520
coming very slowly

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,919
and you feel like well they must learn

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,120
very fast but what you don't see is the

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,520
journey that they went to to get to

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,120
where they're at it can also lead to

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,120
abandoning your plans right

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,960
you spend time you're learning x topic

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,400
and after a while

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,080
you haven't gotten it you haven't been

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,400
able to implement it so you just stop

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,479
learning that topic right which

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,960
ultimately wastes your time

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,360
a recent example of myself a couple of

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,599
years ago i decided i was going to learn

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,960
view so i went through one of these

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,960
courses online and

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,000
and walked through this course on view

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,000
and after i went through the course

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,120
other things happened and a couple weeks

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
later i was still not feeling

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,840
comfortable with actually

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
doing it and using it in any projects

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,120
and so i didn't

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,960
and here two years later i've absolutely

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,960
forgotten everything that i

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,720
learned at the time that i was going

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,599
through that course so i absolutely

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,120
wasted my time

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,720
because i didn't actually learn it

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,800
so these are very negative effects so

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,319
now this this like learning five times

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
faster doesn't even account for the fact

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,319
that

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,160
if you spend a bunch of time on

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,319
something and then just

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,319
stop abandoning what you're doing right

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,000
now it's like an infinite waste of time

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,319
you know infinitely more effective if

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,400
you can learn faster

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,520
because you actually do apply and learn

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,879
the topic versus

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,280
spending time and not even learning the

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,280
topic

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,759
the reason so it's it's fun to

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,520
understand that education is a process

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,879
right it's not a single thing that

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,680
happens learning something is not just a

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,520
single event

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,520
it's a process and this process has many

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,919
steps to it right there's a lot of steps

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,160
to

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,599
to education and we have to understand

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,639
those different steps and how they

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,680
fit into our education plan or into any

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,120
education plan

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,880
so that we can identify what steps we're

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,000
involved with what steps exist

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,680
and if there are any steps that are

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,320
missing and how to bring those steps

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,800
those

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,560
pieces of energy of education into our

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,760
learning plan

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,120
and so if you look at the content

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,880
the learning and the education that's

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,560
out there for people that have

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,320
already become programmers they're past

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,760
the school stage where they're paying

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,600
somebody for school

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,959
if they're in that stage of continuing

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,920
to learn and continue to learn new

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,720
things

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,680
the content that exists in that space

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,800
only provides

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,839
one step of the educational process and

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,120
i'm going to

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,880
detail out for you the steps of the

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,399
educational process but content today

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,399
only provides one step

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,920
so if you think that consuming content

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,600
is the process of learning

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,959
the content that already exists they go

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,399
over and take an egghead course or a

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,600
pluralsight course

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,279
whatever a udemy course

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,040
if you think that that's the process

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,800
then you are gravely mistaken because

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,000
they are giving you only one step of the

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,560
process

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and so therefore you have to do the rest

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,040
now

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,040
ultimately it would be nice if these

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,320
educational places gave you all the

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,800
steps

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,640
but who is ultimately responsible for

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,440
you for your education for learning and

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,880
growing as

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,080
as a developer or whatever

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,680
whatever thing you might be trying to

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,720
learn who's ultimately responsible for

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,440
it who's going to both

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,040
benefit if you do it and learn well and

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,000
effectively or pay the price if you

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
don't it's you

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,560
so you have to take ultimate

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,640
responsibility so putting the

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,240
responsibility on the content providers

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,800
is unfortunately not an effective tactic

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,800
so you have to take responsibility

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,680
for the entire process and understanding

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,360
it and implementing it

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,240
so the problem here is that the existing

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,760
content today

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,640
is passive and i want to talk a little

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,760
bit about

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,440
uh about this con this concept of

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,240
passive education

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,600
uh but before i do let's i want to just

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,600
talk very

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,360
very briefly about the fact that there

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,720
are two really key process

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,200
key things that go on during learning

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,120
the first one is retention and retention

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,760
is the aspect of what do you actually

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,000
remember

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,600
of what you learn tomorrow for example

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
right if i learn something today what do

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,680
i remember

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,120
tomorrow for exam as an example if we

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,240
put up a list of a hundred

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,680
uh digits in a row and i look at that i

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,880
might be looking at it and viewing it

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,399
but tomorrow i'm never gonna remember

00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,839
those hundred digits

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,519
and maybe something that i could

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,880
remember say five digits let's

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,920
let's say that we had five digits in a

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,440
row and we could all sit here and

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,640
memorize those five digits

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,079
the likelihood that we remember those

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,959
five digits tomorrow is actually very

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,800
low

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,079
right that's retention so if i learn

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,959
something today but i don't know that

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,680
thing tomorrow

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,360
then that thing is valuable is valueless

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,640
to learn unless i only needed to know it

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,440
today

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,079
but it really all that matters is what i

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
actually know

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,360
tomorrow it doesn't matter what i know

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,200
today and this is actually a problem

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,519
because it could be very misleading

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,240
to watch content either a conference

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,240
talk

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,240
or a course and start to feel like oh

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,279
yeah i'm getting this all right cool i

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,279
can do this

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,920
and we feel confident and we feel like

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,920
we've got it

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,320
and then tomorrow we go to it and we've

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,120
forgotten most of what we've learned

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,000
so it's very misleading to actually feel

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,639
confident

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,360
in the topic whatever it is the content

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,959
you're

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,240
consuming and you should be aware of

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,680
that you need to be aware of the fact

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,880
that if you feel like you're getting

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,040
something

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,079
that doesn't that might be true in the

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,760
moment

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,920
but it doesn't necessarily make it true

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,040
tomorrow so you have to get

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,240
you have to uh focus on retention when

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,680
it comes to learning

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,839
the other half of learning that's very

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,839
important is motivation right

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,519
and motivation is an important part of

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,399
education as an educator

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,079
uh brooke who opened us up because a

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,440
master's degree in education and has

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,160
studied this very much and

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,680
though in an education uh program where

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,680
you learn how to be an educator

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,360
they'll talk a lot about how to keep

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,600
students motivated because

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,639
a d motivated student is completely

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,800
useless if you get

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,800
it as we talked about before the the

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,560
problems with the current process and

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,399
and how we spend so much time and we end

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,839
up getting demotivated

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,240
and all those negative things that

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,360
happen so proper motivation is really

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,279
important

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,120
and i'll talk about uh as i lay out

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,519
an effective learning plan i'll talk

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,880
about how motivation plays into this

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,360
process so let's go back and we're going

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,240
to talk about passive versus active

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,760
so some of you may have been exposed to

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,680
the term as passive versus active when

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,200
it comes to learning

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,040
and i'm just going to briefly summarize

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,720
what passive inactive learning is

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,240
passive learning is when the student is

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,399
very passive in the process

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,360
so a good example of this is watching a

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,200
conference talk

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,120
or attending a lecture where you just

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,040
sit and listen to the person talking

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,399
that's passive learning active learning

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,279
is when the student is very active in

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,800
the process

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,720
and a good example that would be

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,279
learning to ride a bike

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,000
and it's not a single learning isn't

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,079
necessarily

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,519
exactly one or the other it's more of a

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,800
spectrum right

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,000
different types of learning can be more

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,560
passive different types of learning

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,440
could be

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,240
more and more active and you can engage

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,800
more and more activeness into learning

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,680
or depending on you know incorporating

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,040
things into

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,880
into learning can make it more and more

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,440
active so you can push it up the active

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,519
scale

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,720
and this is very important because

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,040
passive learning

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,160
when we just sit and listen to things we

00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,760
will only retain

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,680
seven to fifteen percent of what we

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,399
actually learn

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,720
and it's important to understand how low

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,040
that

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,959
is and how much of a waste of time it

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,839
could be to consume and spend time

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,000
consuming something

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,000
and only remember seven to fifteen

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,639
percent of it

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,839
and if you understand that your learners

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,800
are going to be passive if you're a

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,120
teacher

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,079
then you can incorporate that into what

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,079
you're teaching

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,680
and do a lot of say repetition so that

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,079
they get the same concept over and over

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,120
again

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,120
and they're more likely to remember

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,600
what's important

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,680
active learning on the other hand gives

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,279
anywhere from 75 to 90

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,959
retention okay now if we do

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,480
simple math here between these two

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,760
things this is where we come up with

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,720
this five times

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,800
and and ten times faster thing so on the

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,320
high end of the passive scale is 15

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,600
on the low end of the active scale is 75

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,800
the difference between those is five

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,240
times so if you are the most effective

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,240
if you have the most effective passive

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,160
experience you'll remember 15

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,079
if you have the least effective active

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,720
experience in learning you'll remember

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,440
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,320
that's five times faster but on the bad

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,519
end

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,040
if you're passive learning if you're

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,399
down at the bottom end at seven percent

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,440
and active you're up at the highest end

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,880
at ninety percent

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,639
right that's actually over 10 times so

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,920
really the variation is as much as 10

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,440
times more effective if

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,720
your learning is active by the way the

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
only thing that's more effective than

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,600
active learning

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,519
is teaching where if you teach something

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,040
you are going to learn

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,600
upwards of 90 of what you teach so

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,480
but it's hard to it's hard to teach uh

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,240
you have to

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,279
go out and and find opportunities to

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,160
teach so if you really want to learn

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,600
something

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,920
volunteer to teach it um

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,600
so understanding these numbers and how

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,680
passive and active uh

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
learning which is what's available to us

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,240
or what's what's easily available to us

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,160
is

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,440
uh these types of learning understanding

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,279
this and the difference between these is

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,160
very important

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,880
um while while i'm at it i want to talk

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,600
about something

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,440
very important that not everybody

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,959
understands when it comes to looking at

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,160
the existing material out there and that

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,680
is the typing

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,880
is not coding all right so if you go and

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,040
you find a course

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,920
online that says hey i'm going to teach

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,759
you x

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,519
right let's say graphql i'm going to

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,759
teach you graphql

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,880
and you can download the project and

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,639
you're going to be able to follow along

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,160
with me so that you're actually

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,360
coding along with me right

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,800
don't this is the great lie of current

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,000
education

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,920
right that by typing along with the

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,279
learner with the teacher that you are

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,440
actually

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,199
coding along with them you are not

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,440
typing is not coding

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,720
typing is typing so if you download that

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,079
project and you watch the video and

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,639
they're typing and you're typing along

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,680
with them

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,199
you are not practicing coding

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,199
you're not engaging in coding you're

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,240
engaging in typing

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,560
and to reiterate that or to submit that

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
in

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,920
my father-in-law who's a works in metal

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,160
fabrication

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,519
he knows how to type i can sit him down

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
and set him up on a computer with a

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,520
project

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,199
and he can watch a video and he can type

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,480
along with that right

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,000
and at the end of that he won't have

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,959
learned anything that the teacher was

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,160
trying to teach

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,640
right but he will def definitely

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,400
pass and and be able to type what the

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,520
teacher typed

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,959
typing is not coding in fact courses

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,160
that have you type along and encourage

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,079
you to type along

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,520
and i myself have made many of these

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,039
courses because that was how i was

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,440
taught how to teach

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,880
courses that do that are actually have a

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,039
negative effect

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,240
because you are doing a mechanical task

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,919
typing

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,840
while the teacher is teaching and trying

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,840
to impart principles and

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,200
and learning to you so while you're

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,240
doing it you're distracting yourself

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,080
with a mechanical task of typing

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,440
as an analogy imagine if you went to a

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,440
lecture at a university

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,120
and the professor said all right i'm

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,320
going to talk about the history of

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,919
whatever

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,480
and while i'm talking and lecturing

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,720
about this i want everybody to juggle

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,840
right that would actually take away from

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,600
your learning because you're sitting

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,480
there trying to do your brain is engaged

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,760
in one task

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,960
while it's also trying to engage in

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,400
other tasks sure it's a purely

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,640
mechanical task while

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,160
you're listening but your brain will

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,480
take away some of its

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,440
ability to learn by doing the mechanical

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
tasks so

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,039
if you come across courses that say

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,400
download the code and type along with me

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,400
and i'll talk about how to effectively

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,320
use those but don't type along with them

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,240
while you watch the course and i'll talk

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,400
i will i will lay out exactly how to how

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,919
to deal with courses like that but don't

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,000
sit there and tap along with them

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,120
you will actually learn less if you've

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,320
done this you may have had that

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,200
experience where you get to the end of a

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,640
video

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,240
and you click save and they show you

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,760
what it's supposed to have done and you

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,600
pull it up and you pull up the webpage

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,240
or whatever and you refresh it and hope

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
that

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,520
everything worked and when it does

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,520
you're like oh yes i got it all right

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,039
but then at the same time you think i

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,720
didn't hear a word that the instructor

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,400
was saying because i was busy typing and

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,919
constantly pausing and rewinding the

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,919
video to type in what they were saying

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,039
i didn't have time my brain was so busy

00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,080
trying to type that in

00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,360
i didn't have time to actually listen to

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,679
what they're saying and you might end up

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,440
even watching the same video again

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,000
so this is a really important typing

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,840
it's not coding

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,799
so let's talk about a natural example of

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,400
learning and that is learning to ride a

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,160
bike if you were taught to ride a bike

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,280
from a parent or if you've ever taught a

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,720
child to ride a bike

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,679
there's a couple ways to do it there's

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,960
the trading wheel way where you just

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,840
have trading wheels you need to slowly

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,679
raise them up

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,679
but a lot of people learn to ride a bike

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,240
in a more active way where the parent

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,520
or an adult sits with the child or works

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,400
with the child to actually learn to ride

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,000
a bike and that's going to be the

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,039
process i'm going to talk about because

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,480
if you haven't seen it you've probably

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,799
seen it in pop culture and it's a really

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,160
good example of a good learning process

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,320
right so the first step to this is

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,799
is that the learner has had the correct

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,640
behavior model to them because

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,679
you and you don't actually have the

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,039
parent doesn't necessarily get on the

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,400
bike and ride around and show them

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,600
but what the learner has seen is other

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,080
people riding a bike so they know what

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,240
it looks like to correctly ride a bike

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,360
so they've seen the correct behavior

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,679
modeled

00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:02,400
then the tutor the the the instructor

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,559
gives them detailed tutored uh introduce

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,320
introduction or instruction to the topic

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,400
they introduce them slowly to the

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,520
different pieces of doing it they break

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,600
it down and however they do

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,440
they do it they might explain how the

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,880
the brakes the handles or

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,559
brakes or how the brakes work on the

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,320
bike depending on what the brakings are

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,679
how the pedals work right how the

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,480
handlebars are how to hold the

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,080
handlebars

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,159
they'll explain all these things and as

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,039
they do that they also

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,000
then ask the learner to engage in those

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,360
activities so

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,799
this is how you hold the handlebars so

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,480
climb up on the seat and hold the

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,679
handlebars like this all right now this

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,039
is what the pedals are for that's how

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,559
you put your feet on the pedals put your

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,080
feet on the pedals and

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,960
you have to pedal this way not the other

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,600
way right and they slowly

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,720
then show the student how to do these

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,559
various things

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,159
the learner and then they might start

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,200
walking forward with the learner and

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,760
at the moment that they're walking

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,919
forward with the bicycle the

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,200
adult is holding on to the bicycle and

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,480
they're essentially operating the

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,840
bicycle themselves

00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,039
the learner the student even though

00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,919
they're holding onto the handlebars and

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,000
they have their feet on the pedals

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,400
they're actually not doing anything

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,120
and then the teacher slowly says all

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,280
right now

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,440
you know let's try turning the wheel or

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,919
the the handlebars left and right okay

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,760
now

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,840
start pushing and then the the teacher

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,080
can feel as the student is actually like

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,080
pedaling and pushing and they gradually

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,840
release the responsibility over to the

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,600
students they slowly give the student

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,960
more and more responsibility until

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,559
at some point they take their hands off

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,520
the bike you know maybe for a moment or

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,679
two

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,960
and then uh there's that there's that

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,480
time where they're they take their hands

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,880
off for a minute and then the

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,840
the kid is maybe wobbling and almost

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,280
falling over and then

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,559
they bring them back and put their hands

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,440
back on the bike and bring it back up

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,039
and they do that

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,960
for a while and then finally at some

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,120
point they stop and the student is off

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,799
riding the bike on their own this is the

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,080
this process is the gradual release of

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,919
responsibility

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,840
right the instruction was given and the

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,280
student slowly takes over

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,799
right but very and then they the student

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,919
has this opportunity to reflect on

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,320
what's going on

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,240
the adult will tell the child you know

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,679
notice how when you break and push back

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,200
this is what happens and how it feels

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,799
and the student is processing this

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,799
sort of information and there's also

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,080
repetition going on all right now get

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,720
back on the pedal all right do it again

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,880
do it again

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,640
there's a lot of repetition going on an

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,080
important part of the learning process

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,159
and it's very important to understand

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,760
that never at any point in

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,440
at least in my knowledge any child

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,760
learning how to ride a bike was there

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,960
a dvd involved watching some video right

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,080
you can't learn to ride a bike by

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,640
getting a video

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,080
watching the video uh or having the

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,280
adult say get up on their bike right

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,960
around in front of them say that's how

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,240
you do it here's the bike go right like

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,280
that's not how

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,120
learning works we and the student and

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,880
the teacher are very involved with each

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,600
other and it's they slowly release

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,280
responsibility over to the student

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,799
so let's talk about the key principle

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,480
that's going on here and this is the key

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,159
principle that is missing in essentially

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,240
a 98 to 100

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,919
of all content that's that's out there

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,200
right now and that is the principle of

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,520
generation

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,080
so what is generation generation is when

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,799
you are asked to generate the answer

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,559
to a problem if it's a mechanical task

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,360
like riding a bike and the and you know

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,039
that you need to brake

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,840
you have to generate how exactly you

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,080
move your feet in order to break the

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,080
bicycle

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,520
and apply the brakes right if it's

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,880
coding

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,440
you have to figure out how do i do these

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,600
types of

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,559
how do i do this type of binding right

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,039
how do i

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,679
use this type of an array to do this

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,000
thing

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,000
whatever it is there's a problem and you

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,520
must generate the answer in a mathematic

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,039
and when we learn math

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,440
the teacher might teach you what is two

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,960
plus two or my teacher might teach you

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,720
the two plus two is four

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,320
and two plus three is five and then ask

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,159
you what's two plus four

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,360
and you have to then generate the answer

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,320
based on what you've learned about the

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,240
principles

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,919
this process of generation is the key

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,480
process in learning

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,600
as you learn to generate the answers to

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,760
problems

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,279
where whatever those problems are

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,039
whether that's memorization problems or

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,840
mechanical problems or

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,520
uh theoretical problems or uh

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,640
programming type problems as you learn

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,880
to generate those answers

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,960
you are actively engaged in the process

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,080
and this is what active learning is is

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,640
generation

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,600
okay this is the key principle in active

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,720
learning is

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,159
generation if you are not gener doing

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,080
generation if you are not engaging in

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,600
generation you are not doing active

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,159
learning

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,240
all right you must be involved in

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,440
generation and that is active learning

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,600
and that's the problem with all the

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,480
content that exists out there is

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,120
think of all the conference talks that

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,799
you've seen

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,480
all the blogs that you've read all of

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,320
the courses that you've taken on various

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,320
topics how often

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,400
do they say i've taught you this thing

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,159
now here is

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,440
a new scenario that's different than the

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,200
one we just talked about so you can't

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,200
just repeat the same answer

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,880
here's a new scenario that involves the

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,320
same principles and that needs to we

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,400
need to apply the same principles

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,320
how do we solve this new scenario using

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,919
what we just learned

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,880
that would be generation and how often

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,440
does that happen in existing content

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,919
almost never speaking as an expert here

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,480
because

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,600
i made many courses over two dozen

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,559
courses

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,679
and almost never did i involve the

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,679
student and generation i

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,960
simply involved them in passive learning

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,760
and that's the problem with content

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,760
today is it's entirely passive so

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,360
le it's break time and we're going to

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,559
move on here in a second to talking

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,080
about the role of teachers

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,520
and then how to apply how to create a

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,320
learning plan but it's time to have a

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,960
little break so

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,480
brooke you got a poll for us i do i'm

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,720
excited and hopefully

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,400
i don't disappoint you with this

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,360
question i actually have two questions

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,880
but i think i think the first one will

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,480
pass on for now so let's go to the

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,400
second one

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,799
um i really love podcasting

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,120
it's like this secret thing i discovered

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,600
i i really enjoy doing

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,200
and um so this is this is about

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,080
podcasting but it's kind of a different

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,400
spin so let me launch the question here

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:57,440
and i will allow joe to participate but

00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,240
my question for you is

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,039
um which podcast would you listen to

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,919
first

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,440
there's star-lord's awesome music review

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,640
the heart of the matter

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,320
with tony stark mind tricks and more

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,200
with obi-wan kenobi

murphy is

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,399
i would not have known that without

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,640
looking that up

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,760
what was that podcast that was the um

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,840
the dino pocket

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,960
apocalypse yeah lex murphy

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,880
alan grant so grant was yeah

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,159
jurassic park main character in jurassic

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,520
park so

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,360
lex murphy is the little geeky science

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,000
girl

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,640
that like the the niece or whatever she

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
is

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,679
oh that was oh yeah lex right yeah

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,919
the niece or she is at least the

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,080
she wasn't like dr grant she's the niece

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,039
of the her granddaughter

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,679
ellie yeah oh you're right you're right

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,559
you're right

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:47,039
the owner of what's his face hammond but

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,200
see i didn't want to put him

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,960
so okay do you want do you want me to

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,720
show the results or should we

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,320
hold on to it now let's see the results

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,039
we'll see what we got

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,039
all right here we go

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,760
mind tricks and more with obi-wan

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,320
that would be kind of cool the heart of

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,840
the matter

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,760
that would be a funny one i think with

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,120
tony stark

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,559
are you showing the results i don't see

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
them oh do you not see them sorry

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,159
everybody

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,960
hello there you go there you go

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,640
oh wow yeah i was a clear winner that

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,159
was the one i picked yeah

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,919
the mind tricks yeah i think that would

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,559
be the most useful thing right

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,240
yeah like you don't need to see a second

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,919
form of id wow right that would be

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,240
really

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,880
so true see and i think even happy hour

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,480
with the hulk because a lot of people

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,320
it's easy to get angry you know nowadays

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,440
i think there's just a lot of

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,120
crazy energy going on around us and it's

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,440
easy to just kind of get like

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,600
anxious and stressed out so i don't know

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,960
that one could be helpful

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,880
um yeah

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,159
star-lords would just be fun but mine

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,720
tricks would be pretty cool

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,399
i was good star-lords was almost my my

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,760
pick but

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,600
well there'll be one yeah all right cool

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,279
so let's get back to it we're gonna i'm

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,320
gonna talk about the role of teachers in

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,279
learning

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,320
and um there is a great question that

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,159
was answered

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,080
asked evan answered or asked do you

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,279
include generation in your new courses

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,200
yeah the quick answer is yes and i'll

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,559
talk about this at the very end about

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,640
how

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,159
what to look for in courses that are

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,640
more active

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,240
and mostly the point today is to talk

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,440
about how to take the existing passive

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,520
kant that's out there

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,799
and make it active and incorporate it

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,039
into a full learning plan

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,399
so that'll be what we finish up with is

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,559
is that

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,679
but yes we do everything that thinkster

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,760
does

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,200
is active learning and we'll talk a

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,240
little bit about that

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,240
all right so teachers

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,159
not necessarily everybody understands

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,640
this but if you ever had a coach or a

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,960
tutor

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,720
if you learned piano or took went to

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,039
soccer and had a soccer coach

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,640
did played soccer as a kid or an adult

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,200
or anything mike my son

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,399
is on hockey he suddenly decided he's 16

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,799
he suddenly decided he wanted to play

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,640
hockey

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,159
hardly i don't think he skated more than

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,240
three times in his life

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,679
so that's been pretty interesting but

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,960
the value of coaches and tutors we all

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,039
sort of assume

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,320
the value of a music teacher for example

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,799
is to teach

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,080
right i took piano i learned to play the

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,840
piano when i was a kid

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,840
and i definitely showed up and my

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,960
teacher taught me piano should explain

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,799
to me what the music does

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,360
but there's a very important second

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,760
aspect of the value of a teacher

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,440
that not everybody consciously realizes

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,320
and thinks about and that is

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,679
assigning proper exercises right the

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,039
other thing that my music teacher did

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,679
that was very important was not only did

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,799
she teach

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,559
me like what the music itself what the

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,440
notes meant and the different things on

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,120
the music and

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,960
if i was struggling with something she'd

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,320
help me figure out fingerings and that

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,000
sort of stuff

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,159
but it was also assigning me the proper

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,840
exercises so picking us the song

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,600
the next song for me to learn based on

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,799
my current skill the thing that pushed

00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:01,760
me just enough and

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:04,720
there's a scientific terms for this uh

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,600
brooke it's a zone of proximal

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,840
development

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,840
zppd zone of proximal development right

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,360
if the exercise is too hard

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,960
one you'll either get demotivated but

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,440
you also potentially won't even learn

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,200
anything

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,200
when trying to accomplish it even if you

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,320
could accomplish the exercise

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,240
if it's too easy you don't learn

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,919
anything because it's not uh

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,679
incorporating new new stuff so you're

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,200
just doing the same thing over

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,679
even though repetition is important

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,600
we'll talk a little bit about why

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,240
exact repetition is a lot less valuable

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,519
than a repetition that slowly builds

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,039
right so the zone of proximal

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,960
development that's having an exercise

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,320
that pushes you just the right amount

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,760
so my the the best analogy i've ever

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,880
heard with that one is like a rubber

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,679
band

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,279
and you want to think of just stretching

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,080
it just enough

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:54,000
so that it's not slack and loose but

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,559
that there's enough tension on it that

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,960
if you

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,480
kept it around something like you know

00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,320
around like a

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,760
i don't know a can of soda or something

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,720
that has it just

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,240
pulled tight enough eventually over time

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,159
it would actually become

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,080
kind of loose it would lose a bit of its

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,760
elasticity so you want to

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:16,480
pull it just enough that the student

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,240
over time will become comfortable with

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,559
it but you're just pushing them outside

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,080
their comfort zone just enough

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:26,640
that they're slightly frustrated but not

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,640
so much so that they're defeated if that

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,760
makes sense

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,480
yeah yeah so that is the

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,000
that is the value of teachers right and

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,640
that's when we're doing engages in

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
active

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,360
learning right piano soccer sports that

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,399
sort of thing having a tutor

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,480
right we're engaged in active learning

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,840
the tutor is the teacher is assigning us

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,440
these these things or we're a primary

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,399
school right learning

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,000
arithmetic that is the value value and

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,159
the role of teachers but right now the

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,159
content that we consume

00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,279
teachers are only engaging in the first

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,440
half of their

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,679
responsibility and this is kind of

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,840
understandable

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,679
because who is it that's teaching us

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,720
programming techniques

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,720
is it is it called well outside of

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,399
college right outside of university

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,919
but if you if i want to learn graphql

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,639
and i go on to youtube and look at

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:18,240
graphql

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,320
who's teaching me graphql is it a

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,159
university professor no it's another

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,359
programmer another engineer who decided

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,000
they wanted to start sharing their

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,760
knowledge

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,119
and so they learn graphql they start

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,839
telling everybody they're the ones who

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,320
wrote the blog

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,240
or did the conference talk or maybe got

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,760
ambitious and wrote a whole course

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,919
on the topic they're engineers

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,520
they're not teachers this may come as a

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,119
great shock to some people but

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,800
education is a science

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,520
one that we've been studying as a

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,960
species for well over 150 years

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,720
right you can go to college and get a

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,760
major in education

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,280
right so we would laugh or chuckle at

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,879
least under our breath if a teacher said

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,119
i'm going to start programming

00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,920
without ever learning how to program

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,760
right

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,599
but as programmers we decide i'm going

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,800
to start teaching without ever studying

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,359
how to teach

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,520
right that's what happens every youtube

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:12,400
video that's on programming

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,000
99 of them conference talks blogs

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,280
they're all written by programmers

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,680
who haven't studied how to teach

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,560
so let's talk about building knowledge

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,880
building knowledge

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,400
is like building a building right you

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,400
have to start off with a foundation

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,160
you have to build a framework up of that

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,280
thing and then you slowly fill this in

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,480
with details and this is a really

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,160
important part

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,640
of the process to understand that

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,320
learning is not a simple matter of

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,000
some knowledge is imparted that

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,400
knowledge gets put into place

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,160
plugged in wholesale into our brain and

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,880
then we begin applying it no matter how

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,960
many

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,960
um uh movies hollywood movies have

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,480
said implied that say like the matrix

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,599
right i'm going to download the piloting

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,839
program for

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,400
the or the kung fu program and now i

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,280
know kung fu right that's not reality

00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,680
learning is a process it's like we build

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,520
it up

00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,400
over time and a valuable teacher's value

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,480
comes in

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,920
in those exercises how they they teach

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,359
things at the right moment they give

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,000
exercises the right moment they

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,599
slowly build up our foundation then they

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,400
build up the framework on top of the

00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,400
foundation

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,000
and then they fill in details and that's

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,839
a process that we have to be involved in

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,480
as well this can't happen

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,440
solely from watching one talk or going

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,880
through one course

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,359
this is the process of building

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,960
knowledge and this is as we learn things

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:31,200
uh over and over again those who have

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,240
been programming say on some kind of a

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,800
front-end framework will

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,160
know that you've been you can work in a

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,160
framework for a year

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,520
or two and still have plenty to learn

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,400
and still be filling in

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,880
uh details in fact uh one of my recent

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,800
blogs and videos that was really popular

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,839
was what most angular developers don't

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,119
know about template bindings and

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,640
template bindings are essentially about

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,599
the first thing that's taught when you

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,040
learn angular

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,880
right so it's one of the most basic

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,520
concepts and yet

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,720
uh i've discovered that so many angular

00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,920
developers who've been programming with

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,000
angular for years

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,280
don't understand some key pieces about

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,520
template bindings right

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,440
we go back and we fill in these details

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,560
so this is the part of the repetition

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,079
right we start with a foundation and we

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,680
have this foundational knowledge and

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,280
then we come back and we revisit a lot

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,640
of the same topics and that builds up

00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,800
our framework or

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,000
our frame around the building or

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,480
whatever

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,240
analogy you might be having your head

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,520
and then we come back and revisit and

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,880
again and now we're filling in more

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,880
details and each time we're learning

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,280
more and more and more so repetition is

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,280
again an important part of the process

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,560
so the problem is is that right now i've

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,480
said this many times

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,800
current content only gives us the first

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,680
piece so let's move into what it means

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,800
to actually have

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,320
an effective learning plan so i've been

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,760
talking about this whole time and

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,359
incidentally by the way i've been

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,040
modeling

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,200
have i been modeling active or passive

00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,200
learning right type it into chat

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,880
what have i been doing if i've been

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,560
doing active or passive passive yeah all

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,160
i've been doing is talking at you

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,920
part of the problem is in something like

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,760
this it's very conceptual it's hard to

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,520
really practice and

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,800
but there's a really key piece here the

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,480
other part of the problem is

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,320
i only spent so much time preparing this

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,760
webinar right

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,079
i could have spent more time and come up

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,839
with active processes and

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,200
exercises for you to engage in as we're

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,920
learning and i even had a couple of

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,520
ideas but

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,359
i was limited on time as i prepared this

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,960
webinar so

00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:29,200
we are you are experiencing passive

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,560
because and this is one of the reasons

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,079
why we only get passive learning with

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,839
all the content that's out there

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,760
it was easier on me it was quicker on me

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,320
to not try to figure out how to engage

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,720
you

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,000
in active learning so that's why you're

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,320
only getting

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,359
passive that's why we've been doing past

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,480
one of the big reasons why i've been

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:49,839
doing passive learning

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,599
so um it's a yeah it's important to see

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,000
that and and it is understandable right

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,720
like

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,160
as much as i might talk about the how

00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,520
bad it is that all the learning that's

00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,560
out there is passive and people don't

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,320
you know the teachers they don't

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,320
understand education they're out there

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,839
trying to teach right i myself did the

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,119
same exact thing i was actually taught

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,079
to do this

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,880
and i still engage i write blogs which

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,560
are very passive

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,000
i like to write blogs i do youtube

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,000
videos now and then that are

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,280
very passive i give conference talks

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,800
that are very passive

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,480
it's a lot more it's a lot more cost

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,760
effective to produce just the material

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,160
and put all the burden of the rest of

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,960
the process on the learner

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,320
so with that realization that the burden

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,079
of the rest of the process is on you

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,920
let's talk about how that process

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,000
can work and work effectively and how to

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,480
actually implement a plan that will

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
you will learn things five times faster

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,440
or even ten times faster

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,800
so the first part is to consume the

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,920
content whatever that is i said watch

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,560
but really i should have put the word

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,560
consume

00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,680
but that's reading a blog post watching

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,359
a conference talk

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,440
watching a youtube video watching a

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,839
course whatever

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,119
consume the content but i don't now it's

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,119
very important

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,200
a good rule of thumb is to consume no

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,880
more than 10 minutes maximum of that

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,280
content

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,560
when i teach people how to do courses i

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,640
do a lot of teaching

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,480
course authors how to author courses the

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,480
ideal video length is

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,760
six minutes plus or minus three so

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,240
anywhere between three

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,960
and nine minutes so that's why it's a

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,040
good rule is

00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,200
go 10 minutes max try to find a natural

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,800
place to stop and break

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,319
while consuming the content but 10

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,760
minutes maximum

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:23,920
especially if it's very

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,960
deep knowledge if it's if maybe there's

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,640
a video

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,599
about the background of the technology

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,560
where they're just telling you the

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,240
history and something you don't

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,240
necessarily really need to learn

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,000
then it's okay to you know violate this

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,200
but a good rule of thumb is

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,119
consume 10 minutes of content maximum

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,599
while you're consuming the content take

00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,280
notes now i've talked to a lot of people

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,960
who have said they don't like taking

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,760
notes or when they do take notes they

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,880
find that

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:52,079
uh they're distracted

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,880
and so they're not fans of taking notes

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,119
they've been told to take notes

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,720
without necessarily having lived other

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,240
people's experiences i would say in

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,200
general a good

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,400
for most people taking notes if it's if

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,680
you find it to be ineffective is

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,480
probably because you were taught

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,359
incorrect

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,040
uh processes for taking notes uh

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,960
recently my 16 year old daughter

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,400
well it was when she was 16 she's 18 now

00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,520
but when she was 16 i was talking to her

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,599
about

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,280
studying textbooks because she was in a

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,200
primary school in high school and

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,800
learning and she had a textbook and i

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,200
talked to her but i asked her like

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,920
you know well what about you know

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,040
underlining

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,240
i was asking about underlining and

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,599
highlighting and she was like no and i

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,119
was like has nobody ever taught you how

00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,960
to consume a textbook

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,200
and she was like no i just you know i go

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,200
and i read the textbook and

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,640
so um for her learning how to properly

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,520
consume a textbook was something she'd

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,760
never been taught

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,760
taking notes is a is a similar thing

00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,280
learning how to properly take notes is

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,000
very important

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,119
um part of actually being effective at

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,400
taking notes so

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,920
like many other things if you do it

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,520
wrong it can actually it can be a

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,480
detriment but if you do it properly

00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,599
taking notes

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,200
uh could be very good now if you get out

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,560
there you can find youtube videos on how

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,920
to take notes effectively during

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,160
lectures and things like that

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,760
but a general rule is just the whole

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,480
point of taking notes is

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,760
as you're focused on what the teacher is

00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,200
saying when the teacher says something

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,000
that you realize that's a really key

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,280
thing

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,040
is to write that thing down right and

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,640
the point of notes most people think

00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,319
that the point of notes is to review

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,520
the notes to have something to go back

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,760
and review so they're trying to get a

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,520
copy of the content on their notes

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,599
that should not be the primary purpose

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,480
of taking notes sometimes it is for

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,520
other reasons like if you're in a

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,440
meeting and taking notes but

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,440
when you're actually learning the number

00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,160
one valuable purpose of taking notes is

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,319
not

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,760
to have something to refer to later on

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,960
the number one valuable purpose of

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,680
taking notes

00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,000
is because when you hear something that

00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,000
you know

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,560
is important and you stop and write that

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,640
down that concept and that learning

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,400
will be processed in different neural

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,960
pathways in your brain

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,839
as you write that thing down and it will

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,480
reiterate it as essentially a form of

00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:01,280
repetition right

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,640
and that will cause that thing to stick

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,640
harder in your brain to use

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,319
very layman's terms here to stick harder

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,880
in your brain and you are more likely to

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,520
remember

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,280
that thing right and so in a sense

00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,520
you're almost picking and choosing

00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,640
what from the lecture you actually want

00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,760
to remember

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,079
because you can't you're not going to

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,280
memorize the lecture but instead when

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,000
they say

00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,960
hey you should take notes you write down

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,040
take notes

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,400
i'm sitting here explaining 25 things

00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,319
but all you write down is

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,079
take notes and that is this prompt to

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,440
you and your brain is thinking about

00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,359
what i'm doing and as you write that

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,119
down it may prompt you to write down a

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,800
couple of sub notes about that

00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,040
as you're thinking about and processing

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,079
that information and your act your brain

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,079
becomes very active

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,839
in that information for that moment

00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,520
right that is the number one value of

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,079
taking notes having notes to refer to

00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,119
later on

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,040
that can be valuable but it's completely

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,079
valid to take notes and never refer to

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,079
them again

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,839
because just that process of taking

00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,359
notes of the valuable things the things

00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,319
that you realize i want to remember this

00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,960
this is key

00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:02,240
and taking notes on that that causes

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,280
your brain to process the neural

00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,560
pathways and the brain

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,560
is essentially just like a muscle it's

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,000
it's different than your you know your

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,359
bicep but you build your bicep by

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,319
stretching it the more effort that you

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,720
put in when you're

00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:17,200
you know doing some sort of workout that

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,040
will cause the muscle to grow faster

00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,960
learning is the same thing if there's no

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,240
effort involved then there's essentially

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,839
no learning involved

00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,760
learning takes effort and sometimes we

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,000
hide that behind games but learning

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,760
always takes effort

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,920
next go ahead because alex over in the

00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,599
chat brings up a good point and he's

00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,680
saying taking notes

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:43,119
amplify his kinesthetic learning

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,720
scribble learning but that kind of

00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,040
brought up a question that i have for

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,079
you

00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,040
is does it matter if it's taken on the

00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,839
computer

00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,800
or does it have to be handwritten that's

00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,480
funny since

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,280
since we have like the expert in

00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,319
education here asking

00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,880
joe the enthusiast in education but yeah

00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,760
so

00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,040
my answer to that would be it can have a

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,400
difference

00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,839
but i don't think that um i think that

00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,200
there's still value i think it's a

00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,240
little bit better to write

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,720
and you probably could could maybe chime

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,960
in on

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,000
uh studies or science beyond this i do

00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,640
think it's a little bit better to write

00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
by hand but i'm still like a lot of

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,480
times it's just not feasible

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,119
so taking notes uh with typing is

00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,000
definitely better than not taking notes

00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,200
nice i think i'm not 100 sure here but i

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,960
think there's good and bad in it because

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,200
typing can go really fast like i can

00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,640
type in the word take notes really quick

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,280
and writing it out takes a little bit

00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,560
longer

00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,560
a little bit more effort and more

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,240
coordination so i think that actually is

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,160
far more effective of getting the

00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,560
concept in than just typing out take

00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,800
notes

00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,920
right yeah yeah actually that's exactly

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,079
it i think

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,839
that the research shows that handwriting

00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,880
your notes will help it

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,839
sink into your brain more i think if you

00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,800
want your notes

00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,640
to look back and reflect on them so that

00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,839
you can create more of that like

00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,960
photo memory that you know that's fine

00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,200
if you type them out

00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,319
for that reason but for what you're

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,079
describing where

00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:15,839
it's the actual act of note taking

00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:18,079
that's beneficial it is more tedious it

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:21,760
is more time consuming but handwriting

00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:24,000
is by far and above more effective so

00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,119
you know get good at taking bullet point

00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,560
notes but

00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,040
there's something to be said for

00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,800
actually getting your hand moving

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,520
putting pencil to paper

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,640
so just something to think about right

00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,000
and a good highlight of one of the

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,839
values of the science

00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,520
of education they actually do studies

00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,680
what is or is not most effective

00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,440
and so studying the science of education

00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,880
can really help you both as a learner

00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,440
and as a teacher okay so you watch some

00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,880
content

00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,400
try to keep it to 10 minutes max while

00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,280
you're consuming the content or consume

00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,800
content while you're consuming the

00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,000
content take notes so next time you go

00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,240
to a conference

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,520
you can literally walk away with five

00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,599
times as much knowledge

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,880
if you simply actually use a lot of

00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,319
times they provide you the pad and the

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,160
pencil or the pen

00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,520
or bring your own and just take some

00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,400
notes as you're watching a conference

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,680
talk just

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,359
like have that there and be like oh that

00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,119
was really cool and then take a quick

00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,720
note you can walk away with a lot more

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,720
knowledge than what otherwise

00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,839
i have to interrupt again really quick

00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,920
everybody that's his

00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:24,480
dog is it pretty audible

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:26,720
yeah it's not like weird bodily noises

00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,079
it's not just one dog that noise happens

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,359
because this dog

00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,839
the chihuahua oh superman

00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,640
yep he's in a superman costume and this

00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,680
dog the

00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:40,079
mini australian shepherd there she

00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,520
is attacking him and so he's growling at

00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,599
her because she's like

00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,640
all over him like a rat on a cheeto and

00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,839
he's growling at her

00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,520
so that's what that noise is

00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:51,599
but my dogs love to hang out in here in

00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,040
my little uh recording booth they love

00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,960
to come in here and

00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,480
as i said the one dog gets on top of the

00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,000
other dog and

00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,680
so if you actually notice like every so

00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,960
often i seem to like turn in my chair

00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,160
that's because i'm like kicking the dogs

00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,400
out of the side here to get him to be

00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,559
quiet stop talking yep

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:13,440
growling up all right

00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,720
so okay now the next step uh while

00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,280
you're consuming that content you take

00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,680
notes

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,359
is then to to practice and ideally you'd

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,160
practice after about 10 minutes of

00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,079
content

00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,680
ideally you practice now this is where

00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,400
it gets really difficult as a learner

00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,000
because

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,760
you just learned something to actually

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,240
implement and practice what you just

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,559
learned

00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,400
in 10 minutes or in the last 10 minutes

00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,680
can sometimes take you a lot

00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,599
a lot of time just to set up an

00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,880
environment to actually practice that

00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,240
tools like if you're learning a front

00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,119
end something front end you know

00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,040
javascripty

00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,160
tools like stackputs can really help to

00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,680
get to that point

00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,440
or if the course does have the

00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,480
downloadable code

00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,839
right to follow along with

00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,520
one of the really nice things to do is

00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,400
actually download more like the finished

00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,920
code

00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,200
and then go in and find a piece and try

00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,359
to implement the same thing that they've

00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,880
done in that in that project

00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,240
uh try to implement the same thing but

00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,520
your own version so if they showed you

00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,240
how to say do routing

00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:06,079
in view right and you can download a

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,079
finished view product that has routing

00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,359
go implement your own go implement a new

00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,119
route to something

00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:13,040
and again this can be difficult right so

00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,640
this is a part where if they haven't set

00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:18,000
up the exercises for you

00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,920
imagine like i'm you're learning algebra

00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,960
and they teach you but they don't give

00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,920
you the homework and you have to come up

00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,640
with the homework yourself you're like

00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,079
crap

00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,440
right uh 2x plus five equals eight

00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,280
and you have to start thinking up your

00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,640
own practices and then do them

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,480
right and that's essentially what you do

00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,400
what you have to do at this point but

00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,720
it's really important to not get very

00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,640
far

00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,640
before you practice and again practice

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,839
is not don't download the

00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,960
the starting code and type along

00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:47,440
youtube i'm gonna kick them out

00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,880
uh don't download the the starting code

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,160
and then type along

00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,079
because all you're doing that's

00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,800
essentially just repeating memorized

00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,319
information

00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,000
don't repeat memorized information

00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:58,880
that's way less effective

00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,160
so don't just type what they typed even

00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,720
trying to remember what they did and

00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,960
repeat

00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,319
exactly what they did oftentimes that's

00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,520
still a lot less effective than coming

00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,520
up with your own idea

00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,200
and trying to implement that so this one

00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,880
is really important but it's also really

00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,960
difficult to actually implement

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,160
especially in an ideal setting so as

00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,400
much as you can

00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,000
try to practice this but again active

00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,520
learning so do generation

00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,839
give yourself a new scenario applying

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,720
what they just taught and then try to to

00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,480
make that happen

00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,760
and see what you can and what's really

00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,000
important here is that even if you fail

00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,839
even if you try it and can't get it done

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,200
you'll actually still be engaged in

00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,079
active learning and still retain five

00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,119
times more

00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,839
than if you just didn't even try an

00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,599
important part

00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,960
another next thing is to actually take

00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,280
breaks

00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,000
for sure take a break every 50 minutes

00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,520
there's

00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,440
variation i don't know brooke you could

00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,839
chime in here as to what the ideal

00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,520
length of time is for taking breaks but

00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,400
sometimes every 20 minutes i've heard or

00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,079
every 30 minutes

00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,119
the pomodoro method is what 25 minutes

00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,559
on five minutes off um

00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,040
i think this is something that you just

00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,520
have to i mean obviously the older you

00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,400
get

00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:04,160
the longer you can go i think a general

00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,640
rule of thumb is like every hour

00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,400
but really it's something that you know

00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,000
yourself better than anyone else and you

00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,920
know what your limits are

00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,599
i think also just paying attention to

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,200
yourself every lecture is going to be

00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,800
slightly different you may not be as

00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,760
interested in one topic as you are

00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,480
another

00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,280
so just be very honest with yourself if

00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,359
you notice you're

00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,480
drifting off and kind of getting that

00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,839
zombie look

00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,640
go take a break go stand up uh just a

00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,359
side note

00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,400
notice that we took a we took a poll we

00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,480
took a brain break

00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,520
here in this webinar for this exact

00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:40,160
purpose

00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:43,040
right so good job joe yes yes

00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,920
yeah so take breaks and again for a lot

00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,960
of different purposes

00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,119
even when you don't feel like you need

00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,480
to take a break if you spend a good hour

00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,880
it's probably a good time to take a

00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,559
break

00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,760
but definitely notice are you are you

00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,920
feeling less engaged or getting tired

00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,280
whatever stand up take a walk whatever

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,720
that's actually a really important part

00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,280
of the learning process and there's a

00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,280
fan

00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,119
uh like i'll give you some references at

00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,800
the end here

00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,119
but there's a there's a lot of really

00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,520
interesting science about taking breaks

00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,599
all right the next thing that is this is

00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,720
another key part is having a personal

00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,839
project to apply

00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,599
what you're learning right so there's

00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:17,040
again this is really detailed towards

00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,480
programming but can kind of apply in

00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,240
just about anything else

00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,240
if you're learning piano have a song

00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,400
that you're trying to learn for yourself

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,599
right if you're doing programming have a

00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,720
personal project if you're trying to

00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,000
learn react

00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,559
have a website you're trying to build

00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,319
for yourself and react right

00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,920
there's this is a really important part

00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,440
because of the motivation factor

00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,040
you'll be a lot more motivated to work

00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,440
on something that you care about

00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,640
than something that you know and yet one

00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,400
more to do

00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,760
application right but if this is

00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,960
something that you care about you'll be

00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,280
a lot more motivated to work through it

00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,880
and then finally spaced repetition and

00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,480
you can google that term there's a lot

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,040
of interesting stuff about that but that

00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,680
is coming

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,640
basically the idea that you need to

00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,720
learn something

00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,240
and then after a short amount of time

00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,520
review what you've learned

00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,880
and then give yourself a longer amount

00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,520
of time and then review again and that's

00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,839
how you

00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,119
convert things into long-term memory so

00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,480
this can happen naturally

00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,720
if you're involved in the process

00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,359
regularly but if you say

00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,079
only to only have time on the weekends

00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,920
to study

00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:18,000
right you're so saturdays take four

00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,440
hours and you're studying right

00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,559
and then you go the entire week without

00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,280
doing anything more that's really

00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,119
ineffective

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,040
so carve off some other time even if

00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,040
it's just five minutes a day

00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,319
or here there but to review the things

00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,640
that you've done and

00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:32,480
have that spaced repetition all the more

00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,319
reason to take notes too because you can

00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,599
reflect back on the notes so if you

00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,680
don't have time to go through

00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,880
another tutorial or sit there and

00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,520
practice at least

00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,200
you have five minutes maybe while your

00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,640
eggs are cooking in the morning just to

00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,559
look back at your notes or something you

00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,640
know

00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,720
and so this is a way to have an

00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:52,240
effective plan learning the content that

00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,559
exists out there today

00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,839
right but and notice that involves you

00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,000
not consuming the content

00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,760
the way the content producer assumes

00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,680
you're going to consume their content

00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,079
you know if it's a youtube video 20 30

00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,119
minute youtube i i get so frustrated

00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,520
when i find these

00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,720
hour long introduction to angular

00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,400
youtube videos or

00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,760
sometimes three and five hour long

00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,960
introduction you know

00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,200
they think you're gonna sit down and

00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,079
watch for three hours and suddenly that

00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,720
is

00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,240
that is so ineffective right you have to

00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,800
be responsible for turning

00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,559
their just the very very very first step

00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,000
of the plan that's all they give you

00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,319
turning that into a full plan that's

00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,160
actually effective so and of course

00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:32,000
you know diligence is a really important

00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,720
part of this to start the process and

00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,319
work through it

00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,680
but as you stay motivated as you

00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,960
actually practice and learn see that

00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,960
you're i'm getting this stuff

00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,160
as you work on a personal project and

00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,839
see it grow

00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,280
that will actually make a big difference

00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,599
a big deal so

00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,200
as an example this is how i learned to

00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,200
study i was very lucky

00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,559
when i learned to program sorry when i

00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,880
how i learned a program

00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,760
i was very lucky because i was going

00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,440
through a pascal

00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,400
a class on pascal if anybody's heard of

00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,160
that language and

00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,440
as i was going through the class i was

00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,400
playing dungeons and dragons a lot with

00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,839
my friends i was about

00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,359
16 at the time and i had this idea as i

00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,079
learned the very basics of pascal's like

00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,000
oh i could

00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,280
make this roll dice for me and this

00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,319
would be a lot quicker than manually

00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,480
rolling dice

00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:16,079
and so i wrote that and then i had more

00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,480
ideas about building this little tool

00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,319
that

00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,079
i used while i played dungeons and

00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:22,640
dragons it was super motivating

00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,920
to me so i never once felt like i was

00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,920
like

00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,440
learning and it was tough because i was

00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,720
just excited to learn new tactic

00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,480
techniques that i could then apply to

00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:34,079
this program that i was building

00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,440
right so i was i now i very luckily fell

00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,520
into a very good

00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,480
process and this is a time when uh you

00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,040
know

00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,319
i did not have a lot of uh active

00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,520
learning available to me i was i did

00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:45,119
have a class

00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,799
but mostly i was learning out of the

00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,359
book and just just

00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:50,160
just a textbook but i applied the rest

00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,880
of that

00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,280
process to what i was doing and just

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,200
sort of

00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,200
by accident and naturally did that

00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,799
so just as a quick note

00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,160
over at thinkster right we're talking

00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,920
about how to learn things

00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,359
things do we do things very differently

00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,559
the thinkster

00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,000
if you take a course you actually watch

00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,440
the content then we actually give you a

00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,160
small exercise one that the

00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,960
author actually designs for you right

00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,480
that's similar to

00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,839
what they just taught but different so

00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,520
that you actually have to go through the

00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:21,280
process of generation

00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,720
and it's usually set up in a stacked

00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,760
blitz exercise you just click link and

00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,200
boom it's open

00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,280
and you get right to actually doing the

00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,920
exercise and then we continue on

00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,040
i need that that process repeats a bunch

00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,400
of times then you'll get a larger

00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,839
exercise to summarize

00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,680
several things you've done so again that

00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,839
spaced repetition we revisit

00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,520
we learn something we fill it in we fill

00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:41,680
in the foundation then we revisit now we

00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:45,200
build up some of the scaffolding

00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:47,520
and then after uh a larger piece of a

00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,040
course we have project courses and in

00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,559
these project courses you're asked to

00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,520
actually build a project and in those

00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,119
cases we don't just

00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,040
ask you to build a project say go build

00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,359
this right which you could do this on

00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,640
your

00:56:55,359 --> 00:57:00,240
data on your own or and we don't do this

00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,240
hey just watch me code up something

00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,920
which you find all the time

00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,640
we can find those all day long instead

00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,240
what we do is a pairing system where

00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,000
we're still prac we're not trying to

00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,119
teach new principles instead we're just

00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
trying to cement them in by actually

00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,240
building something with what

00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,760
we've learned and in that case you're

00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,480
given an assignment to build this next

00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,720
piece of an act

00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,520
a full application you build it and then

00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,520
the teacher

00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,799
shows you how they would have built that

00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,319
same piece you see

00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:26,240
if you if there's anything that you did

00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,520
that maybe you could do more effectively

00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,720
or do differently

00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,760
and then once the teacher shows you how

00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,040
they would have built that same piece

00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,400
and if you got stuck you can see what

00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,440
the answer was

00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,520
then they just give you the next

00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,520
assignment now build this piece

00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,040
right and move on and so it's very much

00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,720
like a pairing session and so it's still

00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,680
very active that's what we do

00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,680
a thinkster

00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:50,319
which unfortunately i i

00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,760
took over thinkster very much because i

00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:53,520
was learning all these educational

00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,880
principles but i was over doing courses

00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,960
at other places

00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,960
and i realized that what i was doing was

00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,160
very passive and not nearly as valuable

00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,839
as i thought it was

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,760
even though over a million people

00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:06,400
watched my courses and

00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,920
that that i still was producing less

00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,720
valuable content and i wanted to produce

00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,799
more valuable

00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,319
content that let people learn faster and

00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:14,240
so that's that's why i

00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,359
i took over thinkster and came on board

00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,520
with thinksters the

00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,480
ceo and i've been authoring courses over

00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,359
there and teaching other

00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,559
people how to author so um a couple of

00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,960
final points here

00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,319
we're we're done um i don't see any

00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,839
other open questions if you have any

00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:29,040
more questions about this please

00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,720
throw them into q and a and i'll answer

00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,240
them but a couple of final things first

00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,960
some references and then a couple of

00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,599
notes

00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,200
one um check us out over at thinkster we

00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,319
have a limited selection of courses

00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,240
there are places that have a lot more

00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:42,319
courses but our courses are very active

00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,920
so the value of them you know for this

00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:45,359
essentially the same price is still five

00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,359
times more because you get to learn a

00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:49,920
lot faster and a lot more effectively

00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:51,359
and you may you have a much reduced time

00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,960
chance of wasting your time

00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:55,200
but two also if you're ever interested

00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,079
in authoring courses online

00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,839
we actually have a whole course on how

00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:02,240
to author technical courses and we're

00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:03,680
always looking for more authors

00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,520
then finally a couple of references i

00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,200
didn't create a slide for these but

00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,640
there's one book that i highly recommend

00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,040
if you're very if you're interested in

00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,520
the

00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,280
in the science of education from a you

00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,040
know an enthusiast standpoint there's a

00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,280
book called make it stick

00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,799
that's my favorite book for this and

00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,480
then there's a coursera course called

00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:21,520
learning how to learn

00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,359
uh those are my two favorite

00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,240
recommendations for just the science of

00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:27,040
education

00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:29,040
in general and learning about education

00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:32,240
without having to go through an entire

00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:35,599
degree program

00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:38,160
so looks like there's no questions here

00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:40,079
uh christoph you start with pascal too

00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:43,440
yeah pascal was cool

00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:46,720
uh i learned i loved i loved pascal

00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,559
been 25 almost 30 years i think now

00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:51,200
since i learned pascal but or i have

00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:54,000
done any pascal but that was cool

00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:56,559
yeah so if that's not that's it i guess

00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,119
thanks everybody for uh

00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:01,359
attending and thanks for listening i

00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:03,359
really enjoyed i love talking about this

01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:05,040
the book was called make it stick i'm

01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:08,400
gonna i'm gonna type those two things in

01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:09,520
into the chat make it stick

01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,160
if you're in the us you can get it

01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:14,720
usually on amazon and then uh the

01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:18,960
coursera course is learning how to

01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:22,960
learn we did get a question there

01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:25,839
it says is it also recommendable

01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,599
the dreyfus model to learn faster i have

01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,960
no idea what the dreyfus model is

01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,640
i'll be honest i haven't heard of that

01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,040
one either should we do a quick google

01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:36,480
and see

01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:37,920
let's do yeah all right breakfast model

01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,280
we have a next yeah i'm over here

01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,640
teaching we actually have an expert here

01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:44,079
in education dreyfus model

01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,880
skill acquisition wikipedia acquire

01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,480
skills through

01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:51,040
formal instruction and practicing

01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,079
yes yeah collection yeah i think it's

01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,319
just a name of

01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,559
it's just a it's a it's a different name

01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:58,319
for basically the same principles that

01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,960
we've

01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:02,319
kind of been going through and expert

01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,359
proficient

01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:06,720
absolutely because what you're doing it

01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:10,079
goes back to

01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:13,200
if you remember at the beginning

01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:14,720
joe was talking about the gradual

01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,359
release of responsibility

01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,200
and to me this dreyfus model looks

01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:22,240
basically like the same idea

01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:23,760
where it's this idea of

01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,680
you the teacher are the one who starts

01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,200
off with all the knowledge and little by

01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,920
little you're transferring that

01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,319
knowledge

01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,960
to the student to the learner and

01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,280
they're

01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,799
gradually taking on more and more of

01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,280
that responsibility

01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:38,480
at first they're just watching you as

01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,400
you ride the bike

01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,880
then they're sitting on the bike seat

01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:45,520
themselves but you're still holding them

01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,319
up straight eventually they take over

01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,920
and pedal

01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:49,520
and keep their balance themselves and

01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,520
that that looks like what the strife is

01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:55,039
model is they're going from

01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:56,799
novice they have the training wheels on

01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,559
to taking the training wheels off but

01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:00,480
maybe they're still shaky and

01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:01,839
mom or dad is still holding the bike up

01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,200
and then eventually they become the

01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:08,160
expert they're over in the

01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:10,079
bmx park you know jumping off those

01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,400
whatever like the little bumps and hills

01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:15,200
so i think it's the same thing

01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,240
looks to me like that i'm glad that you

01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,520
brought that to our attention though

01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,799
scott i've never heard of that one

01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:22,000
that's pretty cool

01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:24,960
yeah that's cool

01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,480
okay so if you have any ideas to help

01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,839
break down a large

01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,440
knowledge set like this i do have some

01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:35,119
ideas um

01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,960
i'm walk through what i personally do

01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:40,240
when i have a when i have a large

01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,359
knowledge set um to go through and maybe

01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,640
brooke can give some

01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:47,440
uh feet some chime in as well

01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,720
um so i do have some stuff like that but

01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,000
for everybody else we're

01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,680
quite a bit over what our schedule time

01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,720
was so for those you know everybody else

01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,480
thank you for coming

01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,319
and then i'll answer this like last

01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,200
question and then we'll wrap up

01:02:56,319 --> 01:03:00,400
the actual uh recording here so thanks

01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,720
again for everybody

01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,920
i i love the opportunity to talk about

01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,799
things that i'm passionate and care

01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,240
about

01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:10,480
so um uh thanks for attending

01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,000
all right so do you have any ideas to

01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,640
break down a large knowledge that like

01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,880
you too that

01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,640
i'm trying to certify as a google cloud

01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,599
engineer having trouble playing these

01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,400
principles because

01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,920
gc is huge as involves yeah i for one

01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,799
thing i feel very much the same thing

01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:26,319
because

01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,720
uh we use aws and i just logging into

01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:29,039
the

01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,079
panel at aws there's 45 different things

01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,440
and every time i think all right i'm

01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,839
going to learn a little bit of aws and

01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,440
so i

01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:35,440
jump on and watch some youtube videos

01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:38,400
it's like i can't even

01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,200
get a youtube video that says like

01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,440
starts from the

01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,559
just lays the foundation i feel like i'm

01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,400
they're focused on

01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,359
one very specific thing off on the side

01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,640
and i don't even know what the heck

01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:50,319
they're talking about right

01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:53,039
very large knowledge set so for me

01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:53,599
there's definitely uh a few things that

01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,039
are

01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,640
important to keep in mind when going

01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,400
through an extremely large knowledge set

01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:00,799
like what you're talking about uh

01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,760
certifying as a google cloud engineer

01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:03,760
the number one thing is

01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:06,079
i think to find somebody who breaks down

01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,240
the entire set and gives you the map

01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,839
if you can't have the map of the entire

01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:12,240
set and where your knowledge

01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:14,079
lies in all the pieces of the map you're

01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,720
going to be very lost

01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,240
so finding that no matter how what it

01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:21,440
takes to find that if you have to

01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:23,359
enroll in a course get on fiverr and

01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,599
find somebody who will give you

01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,880
30 minutes just as like just tell them i

01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,079
just want to lay out and understand the

01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,440
entire thing if you don't understand

01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,520
what the entire

01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,960
landscape is right that's the very first

01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,400
thing to navigating from point a to

01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,839
point b is just knowing what

01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,920
just understanding what the entire

01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,119
landscape is even if you don't know any

01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,200
details

01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,480
be sure that you have a clear concept of

01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,319
the entire landscape

01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,319
i've seen some cool things like this for

01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:47,119
web development or for design where

01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:49,200
people will

01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,880
lay out all the technologies but just

01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,559
understanding the entire set

01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,000
is the very very very first most

01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:57,839
important thing

01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,839
um then i would say you should spend

01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:01,839
a a good ten percent of the time that

01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:04,000
you actually spend learning

01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:05,680
should be strategizing about your

01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,400
learning if you're very self-directed if

01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,520
you're just going through somebody

01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,799
else's course just walk through their

01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,559
course right

01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:12,000
if you buy one of these like course

01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,280
cetera courses they give you the mini

01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,480
certifications

01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,680
right then you then they've done all

01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,799
this work for you but if you're doing it

01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,480
all on your own

01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:20,000
you should spend at least 10 percent of

01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,720
your time strategizing about your

01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,520
learning

01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:24,960
right so and maybe as much as 20 of the

01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:27,520
time but if you spend

01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,680
four hours actually studying something

01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,760
take 30 minutes to an hour

01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,359
and just look at where you're at in your

01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,359
entire learning process

01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:36,880
i like to do different types of charts

01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:38,160
and graphs that show where i'm at and

01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,359
the whole process like i've

01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,200
laid out for myself i'm going to learn

01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:41,920
these 10 things and of the first thing

01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,000
i'm

01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,680
i feel like i'm 20 you know identified

01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,680
there's this one course and i'm 20

01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:49,200
through this four-hour course on this

01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:51,280
topic and so

01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:53,359
that's this more strategy of learning

01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,880
where am i at in my learning process

01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:57,039
and that will help you stay motivated as

01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,880
you see yourself moving through and

01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:00,079
seeing your progress it will help you

01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,200
stay motivated

01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,319
right in something like google cloud it

01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,920
could be really hard to come up with

01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:07,599
personal projects but still

01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,760
some of that strategy time should be

01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,799
coming up with how can i apply what i'm

01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,640
learning

01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:14,319
right but spend at least 20 percent of

01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,760
your time i call this the difference

01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:17,359
between swimming

01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,200
and popping your head up so when you if

01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:20,000
you swim effectively if you you know

01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,440
doing the for

01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,280
your head's down you have no idea where

01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,240
you're going so you can swim for a while

01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,480
and you can actually

01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,760
get drift off course every so often if

01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,119
you're swimming out on an open large

01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,880
body of water if you don't have the

01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,480
if you're not in the pool with the lines

01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,240
painted below you if you're in a large

01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,920
body of water you need to stop

01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,280
pop your head out and look around and

01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,720
see if you're still heading at where

01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,760
you're trying to get to

01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:44,319
so those are those are my two uh

01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,160
best recommendations for a large body

01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:47,680
set is to devote a significant

01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,960
percentage of your time

01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,359
10 20 to strategizing about your

01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,799
learning

01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:55,359
understanding where you are charting

01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,799
yourself out just going out and finding

01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:59,039
hey when i get to this piece what are

01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:00,640
things about that spending time just

01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:02,480
looking at youtube videos not watching

01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,680
the videos but doing a search and seeing

01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,160
what are all the materials that are out

01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,720
there

01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,520
and then organizing what is what videos

01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,119
am i going to watch

01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,079
which videos am i not going to watch or

01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,960
maybe spending some time i'm just going

01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,480
to watch the first

01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,079
minute of 10 videos and figure out which

01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,520
video i think

01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,119
i actually like and which one is going

01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,480
to be the next thing but don't get me

01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:22,240
optically and just be

01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,799
you know paddling in the water and never

01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,839
look

01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:27,920
brooke what about you well

01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:29,599
i agree with you and i do have to put in

01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,480
some caution there as well because it's

01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,319
really easy

01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,599
to get stuck like to go down rabbit

01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:35,440
holes

01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,599
so when you're learning something i

01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,319
think it's important to stay on topic

01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,640
and not get distracted by oh well what's

01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,720
this

01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:45,119
and what's that and then all of a sudden

01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:47,920
five ten minutes later you're like

01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,480
you know up to your nose and all of this

01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,559
other

01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,640
information that's just distracting you

01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:54,640
and it's adding confusion so i think

01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:58,039
really sticking to

01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:02,480
that particular topic but just like

01:07:58,039 --> 01:08:05,280
re-emphasizing the importance of

01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,480
you know taking those breaks like start

01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,039
like learn something

01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,000
take a break and then i really want to

01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:12,559
put an emphasis on

01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,200
going and teaching it even if that's you

01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:14,880
know in

01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,279
in web development i had never heard of

01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:20,719
this outside of this field but

01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,920
the rubber duck theory and just taking

01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:23,600
what you've learned and

01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,199
teaching it even if it's to a rubber

01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,040
duck

01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:28,799
i think there's a quote i'm pretty sure

01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:30,400
it's albert einstein and he said

01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,400
something to the effect of

01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,520
if you can't explain something to a

01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,520
five-year-old

01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,640
you don't understand that concept well

01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,600
enough

01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,640
so make sure before you move on from

01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,400
something

01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:44,319
that you understand it well enough that

01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,040
you could teach it to a brand new

01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:48,239
programmer

01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:50,000
or to a junior level programmer and they

01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:51,199
could understand it and if you don't

01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,880
have that

01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:55,040
you know that foundation then i would

01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,719
say keep studying it keep focusing on it

01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:59,759
before you move on

01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:02,880
um but unfortunately

01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:04,640
it kind of is your job

01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,000
to do what the instructor should have

01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,199
done you know the instructor

01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:12,480
should have created modules and

01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:13,199
micro learning and if they haven't done

01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,440
that which

01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:16,239
like joe was explaining most courses

01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,319
haven't

01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:20,000
it's kind of up to you to look at the

01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:23,759
course and just say okay you know

01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:26,719
find little points and breaks where

01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:28,719
like you self chunk things together and

01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:31,920
create your own micro lessons

01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:34,480
and then focus on little bits and pieces

01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,640
and don't move on until like i said you

01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:38,400
have that knowledge to go and explain it

01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:41,759
well enough to someone else

01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,759
that would be my recommendation

01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,080
all right next question what is your

01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:47,359
take on learning a new framework versus

01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,080
learning the basics of an underlying

01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,440
language first

01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,359
it's a great question i love this

01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,679
question um

01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:55,360
in general my recommendation would be to

01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:57,840
focus on the framework

01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:00,159
first and the lik in the language second

01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,320
and as a personal example

01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:03,920
about a year ago i decided i wanted to

01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,360
because the thinkster application is

01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,840
actually written in rails

01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,640
uh i decided i wanted to learn rails

01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,560
right

01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,480
so i found this place that had two

01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,679
courses one on rails and one on ruby

01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,320
which is the language that rails was

01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:17,199
written in

01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:18,800
i chose to do the rels course right and

01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:21,040
the reason being that

01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,400
this is both it was a very practical

01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,080
choice right

01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,520
i could learn a lot of things about the

01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,520
underlying language and get really good

01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,239
but still know nothing about rails but i

01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,480
could learn

01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:31,760
some rails and know and not really

01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,440
necessarily understand

01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,960
ruby and why ruby was doing things a

01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,520
certain way but at least understand this

01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,440
task

01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,360
and all of a sudden be productive in

01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:42,000
today's world for programmers

01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:44,320
right being productive is very important

01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,760
if you're trying to get your first job

01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:50,719
they'll be far more interested in if

01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,520
you can use their framework than how

01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:54,400
great you are

01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,679
in the in the language meaning and and i

01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,640
know that that might sound a little bit

01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:58,000
funny because they're certainly going to

01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,199
ask you questions about the language if

01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,640
you suck at the language they

01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:02,480
you know you're terrible at javascript

01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,719
you know a little bit of view

01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:06,400
and they're doing view that can make it

01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,239
hard to get past the interview

01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,440
but still if you know javascript will be

01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:10,880
don't know any of you

01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,560
they'll probably have a harder time

01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,360
deciding to bring you on than if you

01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,880
know of you

01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,800
but you're struggling on the javascript

01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,640
side i

01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,920
from a practical standpoint i would

01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,480
focus on the framework first there's

01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,800
another

01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,320
aspect of that is as well and that is as

01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,679
you're learning the framework

01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,360
you will encounter things about the

01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:28,560
language that you that don't make sense

01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,920
and that will prompt you to go learn

01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,800
something very specific about the

01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,600
language

01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,159
it also i think and that process can

01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,239
help you

01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:37,600
stay away from getting you know driving

01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:39,120
down a rabbit hole of

01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,239
all right i'm going to learn the

01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,520
language i'm going to learn everything

01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:43,120
about the language but yet never learn

01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,480
to practically do anything in the

01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,760
language because you're just learning

01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,040
you're getting all this sort of

01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,400
i wouldn't necessarily call it

01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:50,000
theoretical knowledge but all this

01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,159
knowledge about something underlying

01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,440
but yet everybody's doing react and you

01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:54,320
don't know any react you just know

01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,920
javascript

01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:59,920
right so if it was so my recommendation

01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,960
is to focus on the framework

01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,159
but allow for some time to

01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,560
when you encounter things in the

01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:07,520
language dive off on a little side path

01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,600
for a minute and figure out

01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:11,199
why is it that in this thing in the

01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,400
language this they're doing it this way

01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:14,239
why is it that that works

01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,760
that way right and spend a little time

01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:17,120
understanding that but get right back to

01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,760
all right what's the next piece of the

01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,679
framework

01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,280
so that's kind of like like you and i

01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,840
both love to build legos

01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:25,120
and i would think of it in a similar way

01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,199
where

01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:29,360
you know how when you open up a new a

01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:32,400
new kit and they have

01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:34,880
they've put like bag one and bag two and

01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:36,880
back three and so you're building just a

01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:40,080
portion of

01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:41,679
whatever it is bag by bag and it's kind

01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:45,040
of the same way here

01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:48,800
where you want to focus on one thing

01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:51,280
i think at a time but but really the un

01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,920
like what you're doing is building an

01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,320
entire

01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:57,120
star wars ship right or whatever it is

01:12:54,320 --> 01:13:00,320
or the castle or the pirate ship

01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:02,480
but you're doing it kind of in chunks

01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:04,640
like what we've been saying so i think

01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:07,199
the answer to that really is

01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:09,199
a mix of both you know like you're

01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:12,640
you're learning the framework

01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:14,239
and i think you know giving yourself a

01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:17,040
project to work on

01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:18,719
in the framework is excellent but like

01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,199
joe is explaining you want to go and

01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:22,640
build

01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:24,719
just bag one and then as you keep

01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,000
moving on you're you're gonna come up to

01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:28,159
something else where you need to go

01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,760
focus on building just back two

01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:32,080
and then bag one and back two kind of

01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,960
fit together all the while you're sort

01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,880
of building this

01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:37,120
star wars ship all at the same time so i

01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,520
would say it's a good mix of both

01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:42,080
and i there's there's another reason why

01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,520
um another piece of why i recommend

01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,679
focusing on the framework and then just

01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,080
learning language as it comes along

01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:49,040
and that is that then it allows you to

01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,719
build something

01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,000
for yourself you know i was talking

01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:53,280
about the practicality of getting the

01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,320
job but also allows you to build

01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,600
something for yourself

01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,679
and that means that you can work on a

01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,280
personal project but usually when you

01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:00,640
learn the underlying language building

01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,600
something is going to be a lot more

01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,159
difficult that's the reason that

01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,679
frameworks

01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:05,360
exist it's because they just make it

01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:06,320
faster to actually build things right

01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,320
react exists

01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:10,880
because it's faster to build something

01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,880
with react than with vanilla javascript

01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,000
so for the same reason you can start

01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,280
working on a personal project

01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,840
and see results from that personal

01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,280
project faster by focusing on

01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,400
how to do stuff in the framework even if

01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,280
you don't understand everything in the

01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,600
language

01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:24,800
and then coming back and you know taking

01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,520
time and learning more and more of the

01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,080
language

01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,560
and for my own personal life when i

01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,640
learned

01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,320
javascript i learned javascript before

01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,760
there was much of my frameworks but

01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:36,000
uh i tried to learn a little bit and

01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,120
didn't hardly get into it at all it was

01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,880
i was struggling and not

01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:40,640
learning it very well and then jquery

01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,159
became popular and i started learning

01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,480
jquery and with jquery man i could

01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:47,280
quickly do stuff and it was amazing

01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,880
and i would say and this was true for a

01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,840
lot of programmers at the time in that

01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:54,080
like

01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:55,600
2005 to 2010 2011 era

01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,920
you knew jquery you didn't know

01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:00,000
javascript and interviewers when you

01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,040
went to a job they just wanted to know

01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,440
if you knew jquery they didn't

01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:05,600
necessarily care if you knew javascript

01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,360
that's switched nowadays but for a long

01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,000
time i knew i was very comfortable with

01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,520
jquery

01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,280
but i was not very comfortable at all

01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,040
with javascript itself

01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:15,440
and and certainly the dom i didn't know

01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,159
the dom at all but i knew jquery

01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:19,520
so again but i had i was became a front

01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:20,400
end developer and i had a very effective

01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,199
career

01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,560
uh for quite a while and still today i

01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,040
feel like i'm learning javascript i'm

01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,800
always

01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,320
digging trying to dig deeper and finding

01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,360
new opportunities to learn javascript

01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:32,320
deeper but

01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:33,120
um in every case i focused you know on

01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,360
the framework

01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,880
it was jquery and then knockout and then

01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,920
angularjs and i was

01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,280
really focused on the framework and i

01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,880
just learned more and more javascript as

01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,560
time went along and i also spent some

01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,920
time and devoted some time to it

01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,920
but i really focused on the framework

01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:51,679
great questions yeah all right well i

01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:53,600
guess that's it for our q a

01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,660
and we can wrap up our recording thanks

01:15:53,600 --> 01:16:04,079
again for those who stuck around to the

01:15:55,660 --> 01:16:04,079
