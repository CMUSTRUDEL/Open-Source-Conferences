It's been proven that you're learning five times slower than you need to. All the tutorials, blogs, YouTube videos...you're consumingÂ all of it five times longer than you need to in order to learn it all effectively. If your time has no value to you, then there's no problem. But if you have important things to do, then learning more effectively is a critical skill to obtain.

In this webinar, Joe Eames breaks down how to learn skills - any skills - more effectively to get 5 times as much knowledge out of your study than you currently are.

ng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.
