Description: 
	Join ng-conf for EnterpriseNG, the world's largest enterprise-focused Angular conference in the world! Nov 19-20 | Online. www. ng-conf.org.

In this webinar, you'll learn how Sentry helps you monitor errors & performance in Angular.  Sentry gives full visibility when it comes to errors and performance — so all developers can see exactly what's causing slowdowns and crashes. 

ng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.

yes thank you for that warm introduction

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,599
and first i just want to start off by

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,760
saying you know this conference uh

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,160
is very special to me i think this is my

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,920
fourth or fifth year uh coming in and

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,440
i actually met the sentry team here and

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,200
a lot of my friends so

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,800
you know firstly just thank you for

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,160
putting this on and

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,239
everyone here thank you for taking the

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,920
time i know we have someone from india

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,200
someone from ukraine

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,760
it's fantastic kind of seeing the

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,960
commitment and everyone coming in at the

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,160
various time zones to learn more about

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,600
angular and century

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,360
with that kind of being said i'm just

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,280
going to go right into it

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,280
as we've mentioned go ahead and ask

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,640
questions using the q a we have folks um

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,480
moderating that so i'm going to try

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,760
my best to kind of get through anything

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,080
uh that's uh

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,080
that's there as well as i've dedicated

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,960
about 15 or 28 minutes at the end

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,720
to answer any questions by way of

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,000
introduction my name is neil manvar you

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,240
can think of me as a developer

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,759
helping developers i've been working as

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,680
a solutions engineer for century for the

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,560
last few years

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,119
but let's get started so for those of

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,920
you that

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,759
may or may not have heard about sentry

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,000
what century tells you is

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,079
when your app is broken and when your

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,600
app is slow regardless of tech stack

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,040
today we're here for angular so that's

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,159
where we're going to concentrate but

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,079
just wanted to let you know

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,520
what sentry does is it lives inside of

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,200
your application anytime that you have

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,520
an error exception or a crash

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,399
it gathers any of that data any of that

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,320
context

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,479
and then shoots it up to our service and

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,159
then alerts developers letting you know

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,799
your application is broken

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,000
giving you the details of who what when

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,560
where and why

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,560
and then allowing you to figure out what

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,680
the problem is and address it

00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,840
so as i said we're going to be

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,439
concentrating on angular but just know

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,240
that you can use sentry regardless of

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,320
stack

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,079
and this really fits in well because

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,960
most angular apps are communicating with

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,879
the back end right

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,239
so you might have an error that is a

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,319
surface on the front end

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,280
but as a result of your back end sentry

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,000
is going to give you that complete

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,000
picture

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,080
recently we've also released our

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,720
performance monitoring features which is

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,400
answering why is my application slow in

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,879
addition to broken or

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,040
hey this error might be resulting in

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,760
this slowdown and this is how it affects

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,680
the overall

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,360
user experience or customer experience

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,400
and i'm going to be dwelling into this

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,920
for angular as well

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,640
because we do have this offering

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,040
available there

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,280
so if you're not using sentry what

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,280
likely happens is you may or may not

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,280
know about any errors that are pushed

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,000
out to your production

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,840
by folks using your angular app and then

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,040
it gets escalated you might hear about

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,920
it through twitter through customer

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,480
support

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,120
or you know uh a friend telling you it's

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,040
broken

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,480
but at the end you don't have the

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,000
details uh

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,480
and you end up having to reproduce and

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,599
eventually you get to a lot where you

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,840
have a bunch of noise

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,879
a bunch of information uh most of it's

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,720
actually irrelevant

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,640
and then you hit the error or try to

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,519
reproduce it and end up with a minified

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,840
stack trace

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,200
and then debug set breakpoints and then

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,440
figure out what's wrong

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,879
hours days passed by and it's very very

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,519
strenuous this is uh

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,040
happening for every error and such so

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,360
what we're trying to do is streamline

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,920
that

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,720
developers write code we commit code we

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,560
deploy code

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,879
we should know about our errors as soon

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,360
as uh you know one or two customers hit

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,280
them

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,879
and then get all the details and be able

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,640
to fix it so without sentry

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,000
you don't always know about your errors

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,519
you don't always know about the quality

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,200
of your apps as they go into your

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,720
various environments

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,159
and with sentry you're going to be given

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,360
all of this information so here's the

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,080
error here's how many times that

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,159
happened

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,840
here's the distribution the aggregation

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,040
here's the stat trace on this line of

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,720
code for every frame

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,480
and we don't just stop there we'll even

00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,760
show you the commit that caused it

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,560
so how are we going to do this in

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,680
angular let's do it let's get set up

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,200
so i believe the link was sent out

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,959
earlier if not it is right here so just

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,959
go ahead and fork this repo this is

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,040
ng comp github.commdmanvar.ngc.com

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,400
sentry work uh a workshop

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,880
so i'm going to give folks just a quick

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,400
moment to do that in parallel uh

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,800
uh i have uh the century i o sign up

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,840
here

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,840
i'm going to go ahead and just register

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
here

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,360
and folks should also do that and this

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,240
is all outlined here so

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,160
starting right at the beginning prereqs

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,919
will just have nvm node and

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,240
get installed and then we're going to go

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,520
ahead and fork and clone this

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,960
and then npm install npm run deploy

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,759
and then following that we're going to

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,800
go ahead and get set up

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,840
so here i have my application up

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,840
let's go ahead

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,520
and run some of the steps so npm install

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,680
and i already ran nvm used earlier so

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,680
there we go

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,120
and then we will go ahead and deploy

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,039
this

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,840
as well and show you what we're dealing

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,840
with

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,400
all right looks like we're still npm

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,639
installing but

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,160
fine there we go that looks good npm run

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,759
deploy which will pull up our

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,280
application and in parallel like i

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:53,840
mentioned i'm just going to go ahead and

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:53,840
sign up here

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,840
there we go so we're going to be

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,120
presented into our organization here

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,080
and in here we see to follow the

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,680
onboarding steps

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,280
but let's go ahead and finish this

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,440
before we move on to the second step

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,440
here

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,000
so here we go it's still building and

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,440
what we're going to have here is just a

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,800
sample angular app with a a page full of

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,880
errors so that we can go ahead and click

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,479
and simulate errors and have events

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,000
shot up to sentry after we're done

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,600
integrating

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,880
but before we do that i'm just going to

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,000
go ahead and show what we're dealing

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,720
with and then step by

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,840
step step by step we'll introduce the

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,600
sentry sdk in

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:45,199
as outlined here we'll go ahead and then

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,199
achieve other parts of the workflow as

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
well

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,400
it's generating the bundle so and then

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,240
we're going to go ahead and pull this up

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,720
in the browser and

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,720
go from there

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,280
meanwhile in sentry we've also been

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,680
presented

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,440
the steps right here for onboarding i'm

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,280
going to go ahead and just select

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,120
angular and i'll revisit that in just a

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,319
moment but here we go this is done

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,639
so let's go ahead and see what this

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,680
looks like so here i have my application

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,360
i'm going to go ahead and pull up the

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,120
developer console

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,560
and i don't have center sentry

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,160
integrated yet so here

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,240
let's say i'm having errors in

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,360
production this is happening in the

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,680
browser

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,720
i may or may not know about this and

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,319
then you can see

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,560
here is the stack trace which is

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,440
obfuscated a lot of different problems

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,280
here

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,960
and i want to know about this in a

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,599
better way so let's go ahead and set up

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,039
sentry

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,080
so here i'm going to go ahead and select

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,680
angular let's go ahead and create that

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,440
project

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,960
and now we're going to be given the

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,960
steps to install

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,639
the sentry sdk so we're going to go

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,639
through this step by step

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,240
and integrate this into our application

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,360
so left hand side we have our onboarding

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,039
instructions

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,000
right hand side we have our code base

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,639
right here

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,960
and just to recap where we are in terms

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,120
of the flow

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,800
we've done all of this here we've

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,720
created our sentry account

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,360
and we're following the onboarding steps

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,519
and instrumenting the code as specified

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,200
and once we do that we'll once again run

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,479
our build

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,640
and then check out what's going on and

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,720
trigger these errors so here

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,839
let's go once again here and here

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,640
first thing it says npm install so let's

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,519
just go

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,519
directly in here

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,560
i'm just going to go clear npm install

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,560
the packages right here so we have the

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,959
angular sentry sdk

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,720
followed by the tracing sdk and this is

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,320
what is going to enable our performance

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,959
metrics which i'll go into in just a

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,160
moment

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,040
at the end of the session

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,680
so here we go we're npm installed and we

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,920
can see

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,480
that now some items have been added in

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,480
over here

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,600
specifically right here

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,800
and let's go into app module ts

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,240
next and go ahead and instrument as

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,080
specified here so i'm going to go ahead

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,040
and copy this block of code

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,480
starting from import sentry into the end

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,320
of sentry init here

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,320
and go ahead and paste right here

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,959
and i'm going to go ahead and move this

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,120
line right here import app module

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,920
as this is unnecessary due to the

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,680
architecture of my app right now

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,440
so just to summarize what i've done is

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,959
i'm importing the sentry angular package

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,399
importing the integration

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,839
initializing the sentry sdk with the dsn

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,680
that was provided to me so

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,959
i created a project as part of this

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,720
onboarding flow

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,480
also for those folks that are already

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,079
using sentry you can head over to

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,680
projects on your left hand side and just

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,399
create new project and it'll present you

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,240
into a similar onboarding flow as well

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,519
if you're new you'll go through this

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,399
journey that i'm taking you through

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,920
right now

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,519
but more or less we're going to achieve

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,680
the the same end result

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,880
so here we've instrumented the sentry

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,320
sdk the dsn

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,600
is the unique key and we want associated

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,200
with the projects and we want errors

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,279
sent up to sentry.io

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,399
and here is the project id in addition

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,519
to that and we're talking about the

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,720
performance piece

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,279
uh we're instrumenting uh the

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,079
tracing integration so that we can get

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,480
these transactions

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,680
up to century and understand what's slow

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,519
and drill down from there

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,160
and for now we want a hundred percent of

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,160
these sent up

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,079
lastly we're going to set up the air

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,760
handler and the tracer

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,560
i'm going to go ahead and just copy the

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,560
providers here

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,760
go into here and let's just showcase

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,120
what we've done here so there's a sentry

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,519
error handler

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,880
and basically when there's an error

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,320
it'll be shot up to sentry

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,240
we also have an optional dialog that

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,480
we've chosen to show here just

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,079
to let the user know when errors happen

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,920
and to provide any additional detail

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,320
this is once again optional but for now

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,560
it provides a good confirmation that hey

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,760
something is wrong with the application

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:37,120
and we can take action from there and a

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,800
provider for the trade service here we

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,839
have the app initializer

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,240
which depends on the trace service and

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,360
that's

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,240
all we have to do here so

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,880
here next i'm gonna go and revisit the

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,880
instructions

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,480
npm run deploy and

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,760
then let's shoot out some errors and

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,440
you can see we're already waiting for

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,000
the verification event so right now it's

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,000
red

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,200
uh and waiting uh let's go ahead and

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,320
deploy

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,000
and shoot that up and

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,480
we should see a change there and let's

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,440
go and evaluate the data here and see

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,480
what the end result is so just to recap

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,639
what we've done

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,839
is we've installed the sentry sdk

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,079
right here century angular sensory

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
tracing

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,320
and then instrumented our code

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,040
specifically in app module ts

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,519
such that we're instantiating the sentry

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,519
sdk to attach to the global uh

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,959
and then we are creating an air handler

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,600
that attaches to

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,200
angular's error handler to shoot up any

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,760
of that data

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,760
to sentry upon error exception

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,399
and then additional providers for any of

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,839
the tracing capabilities which will be

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,839
covered in a moment

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,200
and then once you do that i'm going to

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,440
kind of kind of jump in

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,880
a little bit more so we're going to go

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,480
ahead and shoot at these errors

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,399
what's going to happen is we've solved

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,760
problem one we're gonna be notified of

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,079
these errors and we're gonna have all of

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,000
the

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,680
the data regarding the error and it's

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,480
not gonna be stuck inside of the browser

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,160
and we're gonna have uh that context but

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,040
specifically what we're not gonna see

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,240
and uh this is uh uh what was also

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,959
resembled in

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,800
the browser log is the stack trace is

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,839
going to be minified it's going to be

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,600
obfuscated

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,519
so source maps are how we're going to

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,240
fix that we're going to upload those to

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,079
sentry

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,240
so that sentry can de-obfuscate these

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,240
stack traces and we'll actually use

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,760
the cleaned up stack trace which is also

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,639
actionable to the developer and means of

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,800
needed developer

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,760
to also detect similar errors and group

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,760
them together

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,240
so let's go ahead and revisit our build

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,079
here i have my application

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,959
deployed right here so let's go

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:54,720
bam i'm gonna go pull up the developer

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,639
console as well

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,160
and trigger all of these errors so here

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,000
you saw that dialogue come up

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,639
you can see some something is going

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,720
wrong all these errors have happened

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,839
and if we go ahead and look at the

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,839
network tab we can see

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,240
that it has been sent out to sentry

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,079
and in the payload are the details of

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,240
the error

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,680
so let's go ahead and take a look here

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,160
and we can see that the event was

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,959
received yay so let's go ahead take me

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,480
to my event

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,000
uh and if you're already using sentry

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,760
and fully following

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,760
the that new project flow i mentioned

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,920
earlier go ahead and just

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,199
it says take me to my issue stream so

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,160
here now

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,360
we can see the error that was sent to

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,320
century it's going to go ahead and give

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,279
you a walk through

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,199
i'm going to go ahead and give you a

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,839
custom walkthrough but go ahead and step

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,519
through that

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,040
if you find that useful here we can see

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,560
the air type error message how many

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,160
times it happened how many users it

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,920
impacted if there were more we would see

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,839
the aggregate data right here

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,120
we can see a breakdown to understand if

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,920
it's happening in all the various

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,880
browsers or operating systems

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,480
or user agents etc on any url so the

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,120
point being is any tag introduced into

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,720
our system

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,240
will produce a heat map and a breakdown

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,440
as such that helps us understand the

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,880
impact of the error and where it's

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,399
coming from

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,079
we see that there's some things wrong

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,680
this is actually uh because of the

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,199
source mapping which i'll get into

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,720
in just a moment but we can iterate

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,240
through all these events see exactly

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,040
what was going on and here's the stack

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,360
trace

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,560
and as i mentioned this is obfuscated so

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,560
this isn't very useful

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,360
uh you know my number one column 84 000

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,399
uh main js so we'll get to fixing that

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,160
in a bit

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,600
but we can also see the steps leading up

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,959
to the action it looks like you know i

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,800
could click on this element

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,800
i loaded up the page before that which

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,639
resulted in this action

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,720
uh within this exception and then any

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,839
other details uh will also be surface so

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,199
this is just the out-of-the-box

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,040
integration you can

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,759
attach any custom information as you

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,680
want but let's go ahead and take this a

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,320
step further get this cleaned up

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,399
and get a actionable staff trace so just

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,720
to summarize we've solved problem one

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,079
where we've been notified of the error

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,959
and you we can have email alerts and

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,959
slack alerts

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,000
uh for this and such i've figured which

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,639
i'll get into a moment

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,440
but we don't have that clean stack face

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,040
and

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,800
which helps us understand exactly where

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,240
it was happening in the code so let's go

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,279
ahead and solve that

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,639
so going back to

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:23,360
here what we're going to do now

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,800
is just let century know which version

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,120
of our application errors are coming

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,480
from

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,800
and then we're going to go ahead and

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,680
upload source maps using the sentry cli

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,959
plugin

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,800
so we're going to install this as a dev

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,639
dependency i've already set up the

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,560
angular project to generate source maps

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,519
but in your angular json you can specify

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,000
source map true

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,440
and what's going to happen is in dist

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,480
you see over here

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,639
we have not only the minified js

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,279
but next to that here we have the

00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,800
js.maps which are

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,800
the source maps that i'm talking about

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,959
next uh we're going to go ahead and just

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,279
configure our build process

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,120
so that it's sending it up we'll have to

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,519
set up some stuff and sentry

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,839
in regards to obtaining an auth token so

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,120
we can upload those artifacts

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,640
and that is the adventure we're about to

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,199
embark on so let's go ahead and get

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,760
started

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,720
so once again left hand side the readme

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,640
right hand side

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:22,160
the code so if we go to app module

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,280
tx once again i'm going to go right here

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,760
and just specify the

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,760
release

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,919
right here next

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,120
let's go ahead and install sentry cli so

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,200
we can get those up

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,600
source maps up i'm going to go ahead to

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,679
angularjson and just show the source map

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:50,640
configuration right over here

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,400
and then lastly as this is all building

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,679
if we go to the make file i already have

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,520
this pre-built here where

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,880
i'm basically calling the commands here

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,320
to upload the source maps which is

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,679
sentry cli

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:08,000
releases upload source maps

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:10,160
we want that being done right here

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,760
so lastly i'm just going to comment this

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,320
one out or delete it

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,960
and then re-comment in this one here

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,559
and we're going to go ahead and replace

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,600
all of the credentials here the auth

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,840
token as well

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,679
so let's go ahead and start first on the

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,120
auth token and then we'll go ahead and

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,160
revisit this

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,919
so if i go into sentry once again here

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,919
and go into organization settings

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,600
and here if i go into developer settings

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,799
you're going to see internal integration

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,080
so let's go ahead and create a new

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,000
internal integration

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,000
we'll call this ngcomp live

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,039
entry cli

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,679
and what we need to do here is give

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,520
access accordingly so we're going to be

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,120
creating a release object within sentry

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,760
and uploading artifacts to that so let's

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,160
go ahead

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,799
give this an admin privilege here and

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,200
then

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,559
later we're going to actually shoot up

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
commits into sentry so that we can

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,760
understand

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,280
which commit introduced the error so

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,760
let's go ahead and give that

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,960
read and write that's all we need to do

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,039
here let's go ahead

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,080
save this we're going to be given an

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,280
auth token

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,640
right over here so let's go back in to

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,799
our terminal and export that

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,400
as an environment variable and there's

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,400
other ways of setting this but i've

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,440
chosen to just do this as an environment

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,280
variable here

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,960
so here this is set and just to recap

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,960
where we are with the instructions

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,120
right over here so we created that

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,440
internal integration

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,720
i mentioned how to get there

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,799
organization settings

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,080
which is from here bam developer

00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,559
settings and then new internal

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,240
integration and then go ahead and

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:57,280
fill out the permissions as necessary

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,120
and set that as an environment variable

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,960
and next we're going to go ahead and set

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,360
up the century oregon project

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,200
so the org name you can go ahead and

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,039
access from right here

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,679
but that's basically what you specified

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,720
earlier or go to organization settings

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,240
you'll also see it here just a step back

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,520
so let's go ahead and fill that out

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,880
and the project

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,880
which we were looking at earlier

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,200
and by default it is the same name here

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:32,159
so nmanvar.org

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,159
bam and that's all we have to do here

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,880
and what's happening here is that we're

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,760
once again uploading the source maps

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,120
uh and i've just replaced uh the build

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,960
process here

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,240
to create that release and upload source

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,559
maps to it

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,400
and you can see the path is dist i

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,799
specified the credentials the auth token

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,440
specified the project and the org

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,000
and the path so let's go ahead and

00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,400
upload this here

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,400
so if i go ahead let's just make sure

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,039
we're done so let's go ahead and run npm

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,039
run deploy

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,080
and as part of my build process i'm uh

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,320
setting uh

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,280
the environment.release so that's

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,200
actually

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,720
i i did that behind the scenes so that's

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,880
why i was able to just go ahead and do

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,880
that

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,120
and after this is done we're going to go

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,520
ahead and trigger those new errors and

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,120
see if they have the right status so

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,640
let's actually just go here and

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,000
let's actually just start with the clean

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,000
slate so we don't get

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
disturb here

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,240
so we're almost done building and

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,240
then we'll pull it over

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,840
any questions coming in shaffer

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,679
i think that's just a good moment while

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,200
this is all building

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,360
but here we go we can actually just see

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,200
those source maps uploaded so we can see

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,679
bam here they are shot up to sentry

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,960
and we can actually verify that by going

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,960
to our project settings

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:27,840
this is also outlined in the readme and

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,840
if we go to source here

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,559
we can see that here's an archive which

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,240
is the release version that i specified

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:38,080
and here are all the source maps

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,080
associated with that piece right there

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,520
so let's go and see if the deployment is

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,640
done which it is

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:50,000
go ahead pull that up right here and now

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:54,480
let's go ahead and shoot up some more

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:58,559
events into sentry

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,559
here just gonna step back into issues

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,320
and now i can see these coming in and if

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,679
i go

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:11,840
and take a look at these

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,720
what we see now is a cleaned up stack

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,840
trace

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,280
so source appcomponents.typescript

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,200
line 37 column 18. it happened

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,200
right here in the code base we can see

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,960
all the frames as necessary

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,360
go in drill down and get all the details

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,120
and now any errors come in will also be

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,840
grouped properly as well so if i once

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,000
again refresh and trigger all of these

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,000
again

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,799
you'll see all those come in accordingly

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,919
and in a moment and being grouped so

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,039
let's take a look at

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,360
a few others so here you can see a uri

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:53,120
error

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,120
you see the relevant stack trace

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,760
here is a syntax error and so forth

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,600
all right so this is great now we have

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,720
actual information we have the who what

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,559
when where and why

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,400
all the all the error information

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,799
possibly you know everything we would

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,640
want

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,720
in terms of an error happen to help us

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,279
understand the impact and then address

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,760
but what would be even cooler one is if

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,679
we would

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,520
be alerted about this which we'll get

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,240
into in a moment and number two

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,760
if we can figure out which commit caused

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,640
this exact error so we're going to

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,880
address this but

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,679
as i've talked about before i want to

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,640
also know

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,960
why is my application slow in addition

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,440
to

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,960
be broken or if it's not broken so this

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,919
is why we've also introduced our

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,360
performance

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,799
feature set so i'm just going to go

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,600
ahead and quickly drill down into one

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,840
transaction

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,120
and then revisit the rest of the error

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,640
monitoring workflow which is the

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,640
alerting of the commits so

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,080
you can see uh from here i just jumped

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,400
into performance

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,679
and i can see a transaction came in and

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,279
we can drill down on any of this data

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,440
and we see the performance related

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,600
metrics and i'm just going to go ahead

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,520
and pull up the relevant transaction and

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,400
i see exactly what happened in the

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,480
browser

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,000
so the page was loaded here although the

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,240
browser's actions that happen

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,360
all the the the assets or resources that

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,520
were brought in

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,799
and the timings associated with it all

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,440
the different breakdowns

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,000
and i if i was using sentry on the back

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,440
end i could

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,799
also trace in to that as well but now

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,080
what i'm going to be able to do is

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,640
understand slowness

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,600
is it my angular app is it my grammarly

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,320
extension

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:30,720
is it xyz what was the user doing and

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,400
is there an error associated with this

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,440
so i'm going to

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,600
do uh probably more information on this

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,039
later because this is a whole different

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,520
problem that we're solving but let's go

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,039
ahead

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,480
and concentrate on errors but just

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,360
wanted to let you know that with this

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,880
integration

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,120
you're going to get not just why is my

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,600
application broken but why is it slow as

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,600
well

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,520
out of the box you can see we've

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,840
implemented that right here

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,840
so going back into here let's uh go to

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,840
the readme and just once again level set

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,760
so we've set up the century sdk and

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,400
installed it

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,679
we've uploaded the source maps and

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,279
verified we're all good there

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,720
i gave you just a quick little sneak

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,080
peek of sentry performance

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,600
and let's go ahead and configure those

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,400
integrations so that we're alerted on

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,240
the fly

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,559
and like i said it would be great to

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,279
understand which commit was causing all

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,039
of this

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,279
so let's go ahead to our issues page

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,279
here

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,480
there we go you can see all the

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,480
aggregation coming through

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,559
and let's go ahead and set up slack so

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,559
what we're going to do is go to

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,080
organization settings subscription

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,159
and activate our trial so that we're

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,080
able to add or slack integration so if

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:44,080
we go into here

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,760
and then go into organization settings

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,039
and go into subscription and by the way

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,640
if you find yourself lost with this

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,200
entry it's just like kind of vs code or

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,600
sublime

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,039
press command shift p and then just go

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,760
ahead and type in whatever you want

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,840
press enter

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,880
you'll be taken right here so if we go

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,279
to bam

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,159
subscription activate your trial let's

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,840
go ahead and do that

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:07,039
next let's go to integrations here

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,679
and then let's go to slack

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,840
and let's go ahead and add a workspace

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,840
here

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:21,840
so i'm just going to go ahead and take

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,840
you through

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,399
there we go

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,640
there we go so we're set up with slack

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,480
next what we're going to do is head over

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,320
to project settings

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,159
and then configure this as an alert rule

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,039
or we could go ahead just go to alerts

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,360
right here

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:49,760
go to alert rules create alert rule

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,039
let's go ahead select an issue alert and

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,320
what we're going to do

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,320
is if this is seen

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,880
more than x amount of times so we could

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,399
do one two three or whatever

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,399
i just want to have this trigger so i'm

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:05,279
going to go ahead and set that

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,760
and then we can set basically uh read up

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,679
any

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,279
uh event attributes or set any type of

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,840
rule as we want and then if you want to

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,559
set a

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,720
a rule on the overall volume or any

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,159
subset of events based on any query you

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,080
can do metric alert

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,720
i'll cover that in a different subject

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,279
as well but here let's go ahead perform

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,559
this action send a slack notification

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:29,919
i want to send this to

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,440
my angular channel so it's sentry demos

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,799
dash angular

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,320
sentry demos angular

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,240
and i could also surface any other

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,120
information i needed we'll have this

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,159
trigger

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,840
at this frequency oh got it forgot to

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,840
give it a name

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,760
here we go created

00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:01,200
and let's go ahead and test this out so

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,200
we can head over to localhost 5000

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,760
here we go and what we should be

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,840
receiving is an alert on slack

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,360
and that's exactly what happened here so

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,880
it's coming in today

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,640
we can see all these coming in we can

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,080
resolve ignore or sign

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,320
if we know what's going on just from a

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,720
glance otherwise click in

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,440
dive in and go from there oh that's in

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,440
the wrong windows

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,320
so here we go which links us right to

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,520
the issue as well

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,720
how's ending incognito

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,399
bam so there we go slack alerts

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,320
you can configure email alerts page or

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,760
duty et cetera we have a wide variety of

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,080
these

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,360
if you're curious uh in terms of what's

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,200
out there and

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,720
what's available you can go ahead and

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,480
look at our integrations right here the

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,520
next one i want to cover is source code

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,679
management this one

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,880
is my favorite one because we will show

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,000
you which commit

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,399
caused this error in addition to

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,679
who assigned who wrote that code because

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,559
uh that's probably the best person

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,399
addressed

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,600
that can address this issue and roll

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,960
forward uh

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,159
in the shortest amount of time rather

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,240
than someone new who's trying to

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,080
reproduce it understand it get context

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,200
and just know the code base

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,039
so this is probably something that

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,000
you're already doing right an error

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,520
happens

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,679
you then look through you know what

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,679
builds went out and then get blame

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,520
and go from there this is all

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,559
streamlined with sentry so let's go

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,200
ahead and configure this

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,320
i'm going to go ahead and visit the

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,600
instructions here

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,120
so we're going to add the github

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,799
integration so once again go to

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,200
organization settings

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,039
integrations github and then make a

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,159
quick little change to the make file

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:57,200
to allow for that so let's get

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,200
right into it so here is

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:04,720
my organization settings let's go to

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,320
integrations here

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,320
we can then go to github

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,880
and let's go ahead and add an

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,840
installation

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
oh

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,760
let me just enter this in real quick

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,039
there we go go ahead configure that and

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,039
i am

00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:02,399
going to configure this

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,399
oh

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,080
i believe i selected the wrong one here

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,679
i want to select here

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,200
and i'm going to do all repositories but

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,840
you can go ahead

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,840
and do select ones as well

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,840
and so here we go we're set up here

00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:34,000
and then now all we have to do

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,000
is just enable this in the make file

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,159
so here it is take this associate

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,799
commits

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,279
add it to right here and let's go ahead

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:44,399
and run

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,880
npm run deploy once again to rerun the

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,399
build

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:52,320
so just to kind of recap oh

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:55,120
i actually forgot one oh no that's fine

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,640
so let's go ahead and rerun that and run

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,720
the build and we should have commits

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:04,080
associated as well

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,080
so just to recap where we are here

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,399
we added the github integration and

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,159
we changed our build process to reflect

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,320
that and we're running the build

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,080
and we're going to go ahead and

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,559
associate those commits

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,880
and see if we can see the the commit

00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,880
data

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,120
okay let's go ahead and revisit the

00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,200
build here it is

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,159
so here it's uploading the source maps

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,880
and what we see

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,880
momentarily

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,399
is it was able to set all the commits

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,679
for this release

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:42,320
so let's go ahead to sentry

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,480
here it is and if we go to releases we

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,279
can go ahead and see that release

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,480
and we see all of these commits and

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:53,120
files change

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,279
and here we go

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,600
and now if i go ahead and pull up an

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,600
issue

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,679
what i should see is the commit that

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,679
caused this

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,280
and here i can directly assign to the

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,639
individual who caused this

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,240
and now i've streamlined the whole

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,159
process from being in the know of my

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,480
errors getting all the context the who

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,399
what

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,960
when where why the stacked race the

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,679
breadcrumbs uh the breakdowns

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,839
and then being able to act on this

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,079
finding the commit that caused it

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,599
and thus being able to find someone who

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,520
is best equipped to

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,760
to fight this error and address this and

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,639
go from there so that's what sentry does

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,240
in a nutshell

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,079
for your angular setup we're going to

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,359
let you know that you're having errors

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,560
we're going to let you know it's broken

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,359
we're going to let you know where it's

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,440
slow

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,000
so just to recap here we were alerted on

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
slack

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,280
and you know we were able to figure out

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,960
which github commit caused this but we

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,879
have a variety of integrations

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,000
and what we did is we integrated the sdk

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,599
configured alerts

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,800
got alerted or notified got into sentry

00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,280
where we were able to see

00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,560
the context the real meat of it get to

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,800
the commit that caused this

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,240
and roll forward and you know get back

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,040
to playing racquetball or whatever it

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,800
was that we're doing

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,320
i mainly focus on air monitoring for

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,280
angular and gave you a sneak peak of

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,119
performance

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,720
we also have release health which is uh

00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,040
you know the sessions uh

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,560
in terms of uh how's your release doing

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,000
out there crash free sessions and such

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,760
which we'll also be

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,839
introducing into javascript and angular

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,359
soon discovers our analytics engine

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,960
so you can query any of the data create

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,760
dashboards and ecosystem is the

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,680
integrations that i was covering earlier

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,880
and how this all works like a like we

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,880
demoed is

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,480
sdk shooting up the errors and

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,040
transactions into sentry

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,400
we aggregate them we uh de-obfuscate

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,520
them and then we alert you find the

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,599
commit that caused it

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,280
and present you a an interface for you

00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,200
to understand the who what when where

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,280
and why

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,760
so i've repeated this a few different

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,599
times but just want to conclude here

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,119
sentry is what's going to tell you that

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,599
your application is broken whether it's

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,960
a front end angular app or a back end or

00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,720
it could be you know

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,240
an embedded c plus plus as long as the

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,240
internet access and

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,079
the error can get into century we and we

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,480
have an sdk for it we can tell you

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,079
that it's broken uh and then for angular

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,920
we also just released uh

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,920
our performance monitoring to help you

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,320
understand that this is slow and this is

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,240
also

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,760
slow because it's related to this error

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,160
and giving you the complete picture not

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,839
just

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,359
is my application broken because of

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,119
exceptions and crashes

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,440
but also where is it slow and what's the

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,320
user experience like and go ahead

00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,520
and you can check out our documentation

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,240
for more information

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,040
uh and our site if you and i'm gonna go

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,560
ahead and

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,960
now answer any questions because i want

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,040
to leave adequate uh time for that

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,800
excellent okay that was amazing thank

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,839
you for that so far

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,440
um i do want to just say before we

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,400
answer any questions we've got a couple

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,880
of them

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,040
but i do want to let everybody know that

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,320
um century is being really generous

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:56,160
and they're giving a 90 credit for

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,720
new accounts um so you'll get a three

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,079
month

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,119
base team plan and all you have to do is

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,000
put in the code

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,920
angular so that's pretty awesome like i

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,040
said that's a three month

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,839
90 credit so just use that

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,920
angular code and then yeah we've got a

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,599
couple questions here so the first one

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,920
for you oh and we just had a third one

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,359
pop

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,800
in too but the first one is how

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:25,119
does error grouping work in context of

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,640
continuous deployment like where the

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,920
source lines get

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,920
ever so slightly changed yeah

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,960
good question i'm actually just going to

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,599
present my screen again

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,079
and show you uh rather than abstractly

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,680
explain

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,880
it so here

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,040
let me know when you all can see my

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,440
screen it should be the presentation

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,160
yeah we can okay cool so here now we see

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,920
an a an

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,520
error that's coming from angular so i

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,240
mentioned that grouping is based on the

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,119
stack phrase

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,320
uh we do a little bit uh we do it a

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,839
little bit more

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,839
intelligently than that we don't just

00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,560
read in every attribute so if we go into

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,960
the bottom here

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,720
you can actually see what we took into

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,800
account when grouping so here it was a

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,000
module name the context line

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,440
so uh which kind of refers to uh

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,520
this this as well as this line and not

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,520
you know the the line numbers and such

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,119
so in a continuous uh in an environment

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,640
where your app is continuously changing

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,320
and line numbers are shifting

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,720
the grouping should still be accurately

00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,160
enough to aggregate similar errors and

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,839
in the case that they're not

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,839
we also have features to help you with

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,640
this so here for example if i wanted to

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,839
merge these

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,440
because i thought they were the same

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,880
thing i could go ahead and do that in

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,280
this case there's not

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,560
uh we also have a feature uh this one i

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,359
don't have the right data set for but

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,320
it's called similar

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,720
oh cool similar issues um and i can go

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,079
ahead

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,599
and see exactly what uh the the the diff

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,680
was here and go from there i

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,599
we deleted it here but what this looks

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,680
like here

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,680
i have a gif of it which is pretty handy

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,839
what that looks like is

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,560
something like this so if we go similar

00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,440
issues

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,359
we can see exactly what the differing

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,800
attributes of the stack trace were

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,040
and potentially why it wasn't grouped

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,400
together and take action on it so more

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,240
or less

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,440
it's a kind of intelligent grouping

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,119
based on uh

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,280
frameworks and based on what we have in

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,960
the stack phrase uh kind of optimized

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,119
for each of the the framework and

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,599
vertical and we also have a workflow

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,079
to help you associate similar errors as

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,680
well and detect

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,280
awesome okay then the next one is can we

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,960
install sentry locally

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,000
or it runs only via century.io

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,560
yeah good question so if we go over to

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,599
here

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,599
uh you can so what we were toying around

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,960
with today right was sentry.io which is

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,320
the sas which has the latest and

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,320
greatest and you can go ahead and get

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,200
started with a free trial

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,480
and even send up a bunch of events for

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,200
free

00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,760
and then we have century is a open

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,160
source

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,760
technology so century.io is actually the

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,079
open source technology with the shim and

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,440
all the

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,599
like i mentioned all those features and

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,359
high availability and all the security

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,119
uh and enterprise related features

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,319
around that and you can go ahead and

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,240
pull down sentry

00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,520
and self-host it uh it will be a

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,960
challenge once you kind of push

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,119
production traffic to it

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,400
but you can get up and running just go

00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,920
ahead pull it down it's just a few

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,960
different docker containers you can see

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,240
right here

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,359
um and here are the instructions

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:29,200
but bam awesome okay

00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:31,680
then next one let me go back to it

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,440
how can i sort by affected users on

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,839
issues

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,880
like ie issues affecting most number of

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,599
users

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,880
yeah so here we could just easily go bam

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,280
sort by users

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,119
uh and this uh will query the issue data

00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,000
set here and go from there

00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,280
uh as well as we could even do user and

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,119
then

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,200
do account query as well we also have

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,960
discover which does all of our analytics

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,839
so for example if i wanted to do

00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,599
something

00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:02,960
pretty easy i could do you know

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,839
show me all of my errors we'll just get

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,800
them by title

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:09,599
and i want how many unique users are

00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,599
affected by it

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,359
bam and by the way i don't have the best

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,000
data set here but it would look

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,920
something like this

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,040
and you could just categorize there and

00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,400
then view that data

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,000
so everything in century is actually

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,520
getting put into a global events table

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,480
and discover is the way that we can

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,680
query this

00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,119
uh and get back any of the data not just

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,960
from the issue perspective

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,260
and aggregate and kind of pivot on this

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:46,800
as we need

00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:48,880
