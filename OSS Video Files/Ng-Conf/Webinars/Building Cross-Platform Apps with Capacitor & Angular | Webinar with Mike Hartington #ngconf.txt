Publication date: 2021-02-11
Playlist: Webinars
Description: 
	Join Mike Hartington for a walkthrough of Capacitor, a new cross-platform native runtime that makes it easy to build web apps that run on iOS, Android, and on the web as Progressive Web Apps— all powered by a single codebase.  Capacitor is a spiritual success to Cordova and offers a modern approach to app building that makes it easy for web developers to reuse their skills to build quality apps for all platforms, while significantly lessening the likelihood that they’ll get stuck on native-specific issues.
