	Join ng-conf for EnterpriseNG, the world's first enterprise-focused Angular conference of its size! Nov 19-20, 2020 | Online. www.ng-conf.org! 

Adding authentication and authorization to an Angular app can be challenging. It's hard to know where everything goes, what the best practices are for working with RxJS, and what the most secure implementation is. Luckily, Auth0 has a brand new Angular SDK to make this process smooth. In this workshop, you'll learn how to allow users to log in and out of an application, how to display user attributes, how to protect routes with guards, and how to call a secured API with an access token. You'll be up and running quickly so you can focus on building features and improving your app!

ng-conf is a three-day Angular conference focused on delivering the highest quality training in the Angular JavaScript framework. 1500+ developers from across the globe converge on Salt Lake City, UT every year to attend talks and workshops by the Angular team and community experts.
