come I believe for this talking books

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:13,620
get so I everything further dr. welcome

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:15,900
at the US uh-huh Mike had to wing it

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,820
there and he's probably one of my

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,470
closest colleagues and he doesn't give

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:29,910
himself enough credit at times pointed

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:38,600
it out what's going on there should be

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:38,600
fine okay um Mike and I were partners in

00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:47,610
2003 we won the award for mcgraw-hill

00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,789
innovation and education award for open

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,270
source we've been teaching open source

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:59,730
for Wow the entire time we've been here

00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:08,570
15 years uh as Mike had said last year I

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:14,299
was asked to overseas and find partners

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:21,200
in Europe and research open source in

00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:24,600
Europe which did not exactly come out as

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,979
great as i expected because they're not

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:33,049
really interested in open source so part

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,049
of today it's a bit of discussing it

00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:41,770
and how what strategies we can't have in

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:51,190
order to involve people from Europe to

00:01:41,770 --> 00:02:04,990
be open source things change this week

00:01:51,190 --> 00:02:10,570
majorly changed that's nice people today

00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:10,570
because of the EU agreement

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,730
even harper made earlier this week so

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:32,580
everything is going to change and so I

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:37,170
kind of had to one off would like to

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:40,320
have that discussion with you and listen

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,290
to you and what your opinions are how we

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,420
deal with this because now everything

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,660
changes because of copyright laws

00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,940
because of textbooks everything that we

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:59,490
are doing now is going to change because

00:02:50,940 --> 00:03:04,560
of this new trade agreement so the state

00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:08,370
of IT now I was a my intentions were to

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:12,720
have some of my colleagues from janette

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:18,540
ohlins involved today but as it turns

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:20,910
out happy st. Crispin's day and if you

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,210
do not know what that is st. Crispin's

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:28,230
is a saint and they celebrate the

00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:46,340
holiday over in Europe one of the major

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:50,810
problems we face first one up there

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,810
rather simple whole community

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:59,170
and that is the truth

00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:03,210
I found very small pockets of open

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,210
source in Europe

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:11,730
Germany is probably the best the UK of

00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:14,959
course is very into open source and some

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,959
of my colleagues here

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,000
into the idea

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:38,490
good whoever in mainland Europe it is

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,490
not light

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,140
second two quotes are my own because I

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,170
had to come up with something good

00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:54,070
education and what's going to change

00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:58,350
with education as a result of this new

00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:01,480
agreement by the CETA agreement is that

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:10,540
open source is the big stick that

00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:15,880
maintains education the last one was

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:19,780
when I came up with but to accept open

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:23,680
source they have no choice ah they've

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:27,300
drained proprietary resources flailing

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:33,100
in debt which is why they came to us in

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:39,120
the first place the EU came to us to ask

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:39,120
to bail them out and we agreed to it

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:58,169
well so why why are we having to bail

00:05:53,250 --> 00:06:04,470
them out number one is because they rely

00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:06,720
upon proprietary software if you go to

00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:10,440
janetta lens you go to Germany you go to

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:16,129
Belgium you go to France what you will

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:20,870
see is that every single person has a

00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:24,000
little device they rely upon it

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,430
constantly now we don't all do it we're

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,659
starting to move to that direction but

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:34,860
it's all proprietary they have their

00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:38,550
iPads their iPhones whatever they are

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:41,539
all going Mac or Android now the good

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:46,440
thing is that those that do do android

00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:55,199
are actually working with software that

00:06:46,440 --> 00:07:01,050
is not proprietary however most of what

00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:03,870
they're doing is proprietary and you can

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,909
sit and you can look and watch people

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,940
and they're all doing the same things

00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:13,380
now I see people here that are all open

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:17,759
source people therefore what happens is

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:19,440
that they continually stay on the

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:28,039
proprietary because they believe that

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:31,580
it's better and it's not we know that

00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:35,509
differently it's not like North America

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:41,840
now as I've said there are pockets

00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:44,849
whereby there are open-source people

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:49,919
Germany perhaps is the best you go to

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:52,319
France or Belgium ordinator lens and you

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:57,380
don't have any open source it doesn't

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,380
exist yes

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:12,090
I don't need statistics I was there well

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,120
by all means when we start our

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:17,850
discussion I would love to hear that

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:22,140
okay um but i can say i actually live

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:27,240
there so i can say you know ninety eight

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,740
percent yeah well we can have that in

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,470
the discussion that's what I that's what

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,470
the intent is is to have this discussion

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,930
but no good i'm looking forward to it

00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:50,880
there's a lack of initiative okay there

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:59,820
is not anything that is pushing open

00:08:50,880 --> 00:09:05,040
source and frankly because it's open

00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:08,850
source it means it's free therefore the

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,920
dutch for instance are not interested in

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,310
actually doing something like this

00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,020
because they can't make money off of it

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:19,500
the French can't do it because it can't

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:22,380
make money off of it and this seems to

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,380
be one of the major issues that we found

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:32,720
or I found at least when I was living

00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:40,720
there we

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:48,920
option potentially because in Africa

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:52,040
we've seen and in Asia it is good

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:56,589
business sense and we see things like a

00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,589
boon to that came out of South Africa

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:11,149
okay it made sense to be financially

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:12,740
viable however in mainland Europe it

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:15,009
doesn't make sense for them because

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:19,879
there's no way to make money off of it

00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:21,970
and that is the reality and again why we

00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:26,300
need to have this discussion how we

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:30,230
convince Europe mainland Europe to

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:35,300
actually do something and get involved

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:43,550
with the project so we've entered into a

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:45,079
free trade agreement with the EU one of

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,079
the things that I was supposed to do

00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:54,139
when I was overseas was to find a

00:10:48,079 --> 00:11:02,620
partner for this institution to partner

00:10:54,139 --> 00:11:08,230
with interested in being open source

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:16,189
went to Hamburg I went to Brussels I

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:20,980
went to Ronan and trust me maybe you can

00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:23,980
sit how do you say humming him groningen

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,980
groaning

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:32,230
you can't even speak Dutch very well if

00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:38,649
you're Canadian crawling on it's like

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:42,819
you go I would ever one place that was

00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:45,430
doing something in open source which was

00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:51,519
Arnhem which was working with open

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:56,680
source and GPS systems I talked to open

00:11:51,519 --> 00:12:01,149
source Netherlands nothing I did find

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:05,649
this university in Zwolle called

00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:07,540
venetian these are the colleagues that I

00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:15,329
spoke of earlier that are on vacation

00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:15,329
today however the holiday they can't

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:28,060
proprietary software in mainland Europe

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:32,850
has an advantage the advantage is the

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:45,070
fact that open source is not available

00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:48,279
now I've put up finish em who is for now

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:56,650
entering an agreement pressing the

00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:58,870
details now whereby our students versa

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,380
we can go back and forth between the

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,380
Netherlands

00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,360
you

00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,779
you

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,779
you

00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:18,550
that guy you know what that's something

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,740
I'm going to bring up within the

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,709
discussion okay so knowing that no

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:26,009
you've got a very good point so I am

00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:30,300
going to bring that up in the discussion

00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:36,430
because you do have a very good point I

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:39,670
also brought up the casita agreement

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:44,850
that was agreed upon which will take two

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,850
years for ratification between

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,200
I'm throwing do you want a very the

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:17,030
discussion today and you know you guys

00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:20,030
have already brought up last we give up

00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,030
copyleft

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,330
because

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:38,630
the EU regulations problematic insofar

00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:42,589
as that as long as we are giving up

00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:49,100
those rights if we're legislated to do

00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:51,230
so we give up those rights and this is

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,420
one of those this one of the issues i

00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:59,750
really want to discuss today so i

00:14:53,420 --> 00:15:02,540
actually cut short my talk today I could

00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:05,990
have a debate and two of you have

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:13,060
already started in on the debate and I'm

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:13,060
looking forward to this I shut it down

00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,509
Oh

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,980
you

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,980
start with you

00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:59,940
here I only have the details and you

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:04,740
have actually made provisions for

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:09,370
whatever is going to be put through I

00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:12,180
rights and textbooks are going to be

00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,180
regulated

00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:52,290
well you got a very good

00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,740
you

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,130
you

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,549
this is this is

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,860
question

00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,360
you

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:56,330
never right source as far as I'm

00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,330
concerned it's not just

00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:23,580
make sure the full labs for GPL anything

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,580
that you

00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:28,230
you

00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,570
you

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,390
you

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,880
you

00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,980
you

00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,890
you

00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,990
you

00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:10,240
you

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,610
you

00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,610
you

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,640
you

you

00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,460
you

00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:26,010
I'm going to agree with you because I

00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:29,570
that was I found in France Belgium and

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,570
the Netherlands

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,150
at the drupal

00:25:54,130 --> 00:26:06,080
they're not no I'm not saying I said

00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:13,790
 said there are kids I saw their

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:16,340
pockets no I'm this is a debate okay and

00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:20,150
that's what is intended to be however

00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:22,220
there are pockets and that's it you can

00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,630
find them you can find them in France

00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,610
you can find them in Belgium you can

00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:28,190
find them in Germany you can find them

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:31,370
in genetics but to try and find very

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:46,460
difficult it's not widespread that's

00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:49,030
what I met so I apologize I'm trying to

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,030
make money off

00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,200
you

00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,760
you

00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,900
you

00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,640
you

00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,920
you

00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,630

00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,630
you

00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,950
you

00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:08,490
you had something

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,160
you

00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,150
you

00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,150
you

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:37,010
look to the numbers but the entire thing

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:45,650
was just shocked people so that we can

00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:50,080
discuss it I believe it's 93 93% did

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,080
neither one's kind of wireless device

00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,140
actually

00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,790
you

00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:28,000
not necessarily

00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,640
you

00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:44,870
you

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,940
you

00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,790
you

00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,670

00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,030
you

00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,480
you

00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,440
you

00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,430
you

00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,170
you

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,700
you

00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:31,360
you

00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,809
having to close here

00:31:52,260 --> 00:32:05,850
to be frank with you I'm that's to

00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:05,850
actually create a discussion

00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:08,720
you

00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,760
this

00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,030
there's

00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,740
you

00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:33,360
you

00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,090
Oh

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:58,860
threatens how slim bit from a

00:32:54,030 --> 00:33:05,330
professional stand well I'm trying it

00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:07,680
and try and bring it up here textbooks

00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:13,490
which seems to be an issue I'm going to

00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:13,490
bring it up here eight years

00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:44,480
well this so we haven't I'm just trying

00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:46,040
to see to agreement here we're not too

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,440
sure because we don't have the details

00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:56,780
of it that this is what they're talking

00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:59,000
about that we may actually lose we may

00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:03,680
lose some they talk about us getting

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,200
better cheese and better beef I have no

00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:10,370
idea what that means exactly but there

00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:15,560
is a question of whether or not the

00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:20,450
copyright provisions right here this is

00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:22,690
the agreement itself but we don't know

00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,690
it

00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,090
you

00:34:51,770 --> 00:35:24,980
thing is that we are now having does not

00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:24,980
get threatened by this these provisions

00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:41,140
you

00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,560
you

00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:55,869
you

00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,330
you

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,500
you

00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,330
you

00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,010
you

00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,470
you

00:36:49,420 --> 00:37:03,069
I actually am supposed to bring this

00:36:54,849 --> 00:37:06,059
discussion I really am and that I'm

00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:10,530
going to love discussing up Hampshire I

00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:10,530
do have to close off here

00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,470
you

00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:25,309
a chance for us to all

00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:40,119
trying to be a little bit of an end

00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:44,369
antagonistic to talk to you all later

00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:47,880

00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:47,880
