bridging the gap between very technical

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:10,639
aspects and partner with everyone to

00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,630
everyone it's a scanning a game so you

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,689
pronounce the J like you do in York so

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,740
it's ma my Kim and that's how you get it

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:28,260
and um my pediatrician growing up I had

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,480
him until I was 11 and we had given up

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,329
correcting him and the very last

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,969
appointment we had before we moved he

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,790
heard my grandmother call me Mikan and

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,570
the look on his face when he realized

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:46,680
he'd been calling me majken for 10 years

00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:51,989
you do not feel as bad as he did uh yes

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:54,390
yes so thank you very much um yeah a

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,190
little bit more about my background I

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,590
was shocked to realize I have been

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,680
involved with Mozilla for for ten years

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,059
which is especially shocking because

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,880
growing up into high school I was

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,670
definitely the drama music geek and I

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,720
ended up somehow in the position of

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,210
computer geek through osmosis through

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,119
through friends your relationship I

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,390
don't code and that is by choice it

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:25,830
doesn't interest me but computers open

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:28,229
source using the programs do I have a

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,450
lot of experience in the past doing like

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,400
like he said user support that was my

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,670
first major in Mozilla contribution I

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,180
have teenagers and an ex-husband so I

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,100
have a lot of experience with difficult

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,590
communications of all kinds including

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:48,740
lots of newsgroups and in real life and

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:52,229
so I felt like I have some expertise I

00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,880
want to share one of the skills that i

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:57,840
have that i've been told as rares i

00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,030
speak both user and developer so one

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,159
things that people sometimes use me for

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,020
is developers will have a user that

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,360
started talking in their bug they have

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,950
no idea what they're doing have no idea

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,170
no interest in handling the person

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,610
they'll ping me you know can you take a

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,650
look at this and I'll be like oh yeah I

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,640
know this guy just wants this

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:21,110
oh that so that's that's why I wanted to

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,189
give this presentation today because I

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,739
think a lot of the time when we talk

00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:28,409
about communication and sensitivity it's

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,299
from a perspective that doesn't always

00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:35,280
resonate with everyone including myself

00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:38,489
and so also coming from a Mozilla

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,230
background I have actually prepared this

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,590
presentation though it can be

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:46,530
interactive I have a backup but it would

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,389
be lovely if people wanted to move a

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,670
little closer so it was easier to

00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:58,290
interact I won't bully you into it but

00:02:52,670 --> 00:03:00,359
maybe you will later on okay so word

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,180
problems everything I need to know about

00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:06,000
arguments I learned in math class so

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,069
we're going to start with a persona we

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,599
have this lovely couple their names

00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:14,510
happen to be Shawn and Kenzie there a

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,510
modern tech savvy couple just go with it

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,500
they've decided it's time to invest some

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,849
of their savings in the tech sector they

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,680
make a combined income of ninety

00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:24,629
thousand dollars a year if they save

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,980
five percent a month over 18 months how

00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:32,359
much money do they have to invest so we

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:35,519
I have a lovely volunteer that I've

00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:38,459
brought in beforehand we're going to act

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:49,169
out how this argument would probably go

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:54,319
between the couple's me Blake a Knight

00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:57,419
Rider music yes it's over here okay yes

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,040
lovely dear husband who is so wonderful

00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:03,060
to quit his acting career to be with me

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,709
and I think that we've managed to say

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,269
about six thousand four hundred and

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:14,760
fifty dollars to invest that's how much

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:16,650
we should invest but I'm really good at

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,229
math they like totally had me give us a

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:22,169
presentation at Seneca about math so I

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:24,779
must be right well I look better with

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:27,360
facial later so I must be right okay so

00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:29,580
I think those of you in the audience who

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,960
of experience with math are probably

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,150
sitting there thinking you guys are

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,680
being ridiculous anyone want to share

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:49,349
some thoughts what you think we should

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:55,889
be doing instead yes okay aha yes go for

00:04:49,349 --> 00:05:01,349
it yeah check your work now i'll show

00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:03,060
you so in this case we just gave our

00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:22,590
totals and we're arguing back and forth

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:27,270
yeah go ahead yeah mm-hmm yes that's

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:29,729
lovely and that that principle i think i

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,490
have an example coming up and that also

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,440
explains that and i love that this is

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,889
exactly it you know the problem solving

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,509
skills you start to think about i was a

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:41,190
little worried about what level of math

00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:42,990
to make these problems because i didn't

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,550
want to lose people but i also figured

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,409
there'd be people like you who would be

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,750
like well this is too simple you need to

00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:50,789
factor this and in fact elicit so this

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,000
is something that we do with arguments

00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:55,620
with people all the time but you guys

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,449
are all sitting there thinking why are

00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:02,419
you doing this just write down the mat

00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:04,589
and see who's right and and so that's

00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:06,900
that's the first principle the first

00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:08,669
mistake we make when dealing with people

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,839
it's hard for people to see that you're

00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,360
right if they can't follow your

00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,460
reasoning it's hard for people to help

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:20,550
you understand your mistake if they

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:23,759
don't see how you got to your answer and

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,710
so yes so this this slide is of these

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,120
slides aren't filled in for every single

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,969
example and kind of hoping we'll have

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,650
some audience participation and but this

00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:33,240
is the kind of arguments we fall into

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:35,069
with words that we wouldn't fall into

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,259
with numbers why is that the right

00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:40,229
answer because I said so I don't know I

00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,660
just want it no I'm right no I'm right

00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:46,300
now I'm right

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,610
so next example where to invest Sean

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,810
knows everyone uses acne cloud services

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,240
and thinks they're a good investment

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,980
kenzie has a friend that just joined the

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,710
startup widgets and thinks they're a

00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,750
great place to get in early Sean wants

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,370
to buy 100 shares of acne and 50 shares

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,140
of widgets for a total investment of

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,480
four thousand seven hundred and fifty

00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:06,640
dollars kenzie wants to buy 200 shares

00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,500
of widgets and 100 shares of acne for a

00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,060
total of seven thousand dollars I am a

00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,980
little bit of a typical girl I will

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,980
overspend if I think there's value in it

00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:19,990
oh right I forgot to tell you Sean Bean

00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:22,510
was right it was 6750 so I'm only 250

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:26,170
over with what I want to spend how much

00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:28,870
does each widget share costs so Sean

00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,840
thinks they're $45 and kenzie thinks

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,800
they're fifteen dollars and does anyone

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:46,180
want to come and act out the argument

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:48,669
sure come on down oh oh no I ok so I had

00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,940
originally started the problem with

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:54,640
facebook and but I made these up last

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,440
night and I did not have time to ask my

00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,820
friends how much was your share worth

00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,370
the one they gave it to you and how much

00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,080
was it worth at the IPO and I knew there

00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,370
would be people in the audience who

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,160
would then say well that's not what the

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,160
share was worth so I made up companies

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,860
anyone want to come act it out with me

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:24,040
it's a lot more fun if we acted out

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:33,940
awesome thank you do you want to be Sean

00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:48,270
or Kenzie ok ok so i think i think the

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:51,790
answer is $45 ok but i did the math and

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:55,000
you know if if you take the two things

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,240
we want and it looks like we both want

00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,360
to buy

00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,730
the same shares of acne so that lets us

00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,140
I stole this problem from Khan Academy I

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,279
don't remember the math that well

00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:08,500
someone correct me if I explain our own

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,020
we can we can balance out the equations

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,540
we can make them then we can isolate out

00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,830
the X and then everything else is oh you

00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,320
know what I just realized how I should

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:20,260
have done this math awesome so yeah we

00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,330
make everything equal 100 x then we can

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,950
make them equal each other and then this

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:45,970
is just sort of a shortcut of doing it

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:51,279
and I totally got 45 yes so right like

00:09:45,970 --> 00:10:00,430
that into account I got a total I got a

00:09:51,279 --> 00:10:05,310
total you know what I just realized I

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:11,529
made a mistake in my mouth when I

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:14,680
isolated my equation right I'm over here

00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:17,380
because all right when argued my math I

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,709
forgot because I line these up wrong

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:24,010
I've forgotten i minus the 100 x from

00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:26,110
the 50 y instead of the 200 so you know

00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:29,589
what I'm looking back and if I do the

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:38,680
math right I get 15 as well thank you

00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:41,200
very much so that this is a big one

00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,649
check your work just like in math

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,140
sometimes we miss stuff or making crepes

00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:49,120
assumptions in our logic when when we're

00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,430
arguing for for our point of view and

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,500
also if you take the time to understand

00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,779
how someone got to an answer you can see

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,970
how best to persuade them that you're

00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:59,980
right or realize they're wrong so if i

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,899
had if we had swap cards you might have

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,029
actually been able to check my work then

00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:05,680
like no see here's here's what you did

00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:08,010
wrong and then of course i'm going to

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,240
accept it because

00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:14,820
yeah it's math it's obvious and there's

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,800
some real-world implications for this

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,310
one check facts before you use them in

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,340
an argument and I mean in these days

00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:26,760
it's really easy to do we've got the

00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,770
internet my kids fight all the time who

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,020
was that after in that movie what's the

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,820
lyric to this song and there's a new

00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:50,970
phrase on our household you're holding

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:53,070
the Internet yes yeah that's true and so

00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:56,490
you've got to fact check your facts as

00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,470
well and that's that's exactly that's

00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:02,460
exactly right that does become harder

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:05,700
and and more challenging because you can

00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,680
start off with the basic example of I

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:11,460
keep forgetting that it's james marsden

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,070
an enchanted not James Franco so what I

00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,870
was telling someone what happened to

00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,240
James Franco he used to be so handsome

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,150
he was the gorgeous prints and enchanted

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,730
I was wrong I looked it up myself on

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:26,550
IMDb which you know that's a good you

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,160
can agree a reputable source it's pretty

00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:31,410
maintained so there was no need to argue

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,390
back and forth that was James Franco

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,060
know it wasn't yes it was why would we

00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:39,410
argue we wouldn't do that about math we

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,410
would check the work we'd look it up

00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,420
okay so look who was right Tennessee was

00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,060
right widget stock goes up five dollars

00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,240
a share how much is Shani hens his total

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:55,590
investment in widget worth now all right

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:57,990
anyone else want to come ass out oh XD

00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:04,080
volunteers coming you're going to go the

00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:07,470
opposite direction aren't you all right

00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,600
that's okay and I'll just go to the

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,620
slide and we can all try and participate

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,960
so here's their math you can see Sean

00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:20,889
and Kenzie are going to discuss back and

00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:23,139
forth their answers

00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:26,259
you can see is there anything wrong with

00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:35,199
Sean's math is there anything wrong with

00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:47,470
Kensi's math can anyone figure out why

00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:50,859
they have a different answer exactly yep

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:54,220
that's exactly it they're both

00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:56,319
calculating for what they want to do so

00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,899
their calculations are both right

00:13:56,319 --> 00:14:02,079
they're both feeling no I'm right now on

00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:05,439
right the difference is make sure the

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,540
problem is clear I didn't tell you which

00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:10,749
stock options they actually ended up

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:12,850
buying so if you're trying to solve a

00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:15,009
problem for someone you need to make

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,319
sure you understand the problem look for

00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:20,139
missing information if you're asking

00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:21,309
someone to help you solve a problem make

00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:23,799
sure that you've included the

00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:25,689
information it's really easy I do this

00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:28,360
all the time when I'm emailing on

00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:31,689
mailing lists I'll write a few sentences

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,519
I've had the context in my head and I

00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:36,100
forget to put the context in the email

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,809
and then people will either not sure

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,029
what I'm talking about or they'll think

00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:42,459
I'm referring to what the person before

00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:48,279
me was referring to and it can cause

00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:49,540
confusion know what I know right but you

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,619
know what this is something that happens

00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:57,730
in in real life um so yeah context is

00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:59,529
important and I can use some help

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,179
filling out the slides but you know

00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:05,470
that's what happens people can get

00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:08,379
really angry with each other without

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:10,089
actually going back and looking did I

00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:12,160
actually tell you everything you need to

00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:14,619
know to understand what I'm saying or

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,279
you know you can get really mad at

00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:21,429
someone well I gave you the answer well

00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:23,649
did you actually you know can you see if

00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:26,709
there's room where you made assumption

00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:28,980
about the problem you solve and maybe

00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:31,470
the problem you solve isn't the problem

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:35,040
they solve

00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:38,010
so next example good thing Tron Sean

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,900
Johnston Kenzie and landed at buying the

00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:42,030
200 shares and widgets which was a good

00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:45,390
thing because acne cloud services was

00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:50,880
hacked their share values fall fifty

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:53,430
percent how much did they lose so Sean

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,890
says a thousand dollars and Kenzie says

00:15:53,430 --> 00:16:00,650
two thousand dollars so who's right and

00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:03,240
how did they find out she's right so

00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:05,100
just like math class who couldn't who

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:10,350
can tell why do they have different

00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:14,270
answers did someone make a mistake they

00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,270
put in the same value for Z this time

00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:24,180
yeah and Sean when he bought the stocks

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,460
and I made this up I don't know if this

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,740
is real he bought some insurance just in

00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,390
case a stock took a tumble and it'll

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,810
reimburse you up to a thousand dollars

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,730
on that investment so Kenzie didn't know

00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:42,120
that so she didn't factor it into her

00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:44,310
equation he did so that's another reason

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,410
why we can end up in arguments with with

00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:48,540
people because we're factoring in

00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:51,630
something that the other person isn't so

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:54,450
that's sort of the a different angle on

00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:56,340
the last example making sure everyone

00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,200
has all the context and all the

00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,840
information to be able to see it from

00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,180
your point of view and also making sure

00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,530
that you know you you also give the

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:12,360
other person the benefit of the doubt

00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:14,910
maybe you're missing a variable and so

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:18,030
yes these are the slides I didn't fill

00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:21,300
out if anyone has examples of a real

00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:24,090
world problems arguments they've had

00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:26,280
with people with words where it turned

00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:32,190
out that you were actually you forgot to

00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:33,660
factor it and you maybe um someone says

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,890
yeah I'm just leaving the house now when

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,130
you expect them to be there in half an

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,240
hour you forgot to factor in that they

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,130
were going to stop at the grocery store

00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,540
first so they show up the restaurant and

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,059
you're really mad at them for being late

00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:47,539
but it turns out

00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,539
you

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:46,549
thank you Tom I'll recap because i want

00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:49,909
to add on to that and thomas talking

00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:52,700
about the basic example of he's got the

00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:55,849
sales team who wants a feature by a

00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,529
certain deadline and they just want it

00:19:55,849 --> 00:20:00,049
fast they want it done because they want

00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:02,059
to make the customer happy and one

00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:04,489
variable they're missing that may be the

00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:08,450
engineering team wants to put in is is

00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:11,029
the amount of the chances of things not

00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,639
working the chances there being bugs the

00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:17,869
the chances you needing to to sink more

00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:19,729
support costs into it afterwards and you

00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:21,379
know what that reminds me one one really

00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:25,639
big real world example is when you're

00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:28,879
estimating your job hun in that exact

00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:31,340
example jonathan nightingale who is vp

00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:33,379
of firefox at mozilla now wrote a really

00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:37,159
great blog post and i think he took it

00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:39,200
from someone else and someone some

00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:42,109
company has a practice of asking for

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,229
three estimates best-case worst case and

00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:48,139
mid case and more often than not they

00:20:45,229 --> 00:20:50,210
were hitting the mid case estimates but

00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:52,220
if you were asking people just for one

00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,590
estimate they wanted to give you the

00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,690
best case because they didn't want to

00:20:54,590 --> 00:21:01,570
look bad they wanted to make sure you

00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,570
were happy with their work yes

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,529
yeah yeah exactly i'll r ich8 half that

00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:03,649
as well cuz I'm the one wearing the mic

00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:05,899
and hopefully it stays in my head I'm

00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:08,419
gonna and when you when you're talking

00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:10,039
about when someone is asking you do a

00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:11,539
job sometimes they actually come to you

00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:14,149
and give you the time estimate they'll

00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:16,340
they have some degree of knowledge of

00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:21,169
what what you're working on and they'll

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:24,409
say it should only take a week and maybe

00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:26,299
they're thinking that there's more more

00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:30,679
aspects to the projects and then you're

00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:33,139
thinking about and back to talking about

00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,179
arguments and resolving them this this

00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:37,460
is exactly this is where you would apply

00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:39,739
the skills you would need to break down

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,479
all the variables in the time estimate

00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:43,820
and show them the ones they're not

00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:45,739
taking into consideration and explain to

00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:49,129
them why those are important and why

00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:52,249
those needs to be factored in and at the

00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:54,440
on the flip side if someone's trying to

00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:57,559
tell you know this is going to take me

00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,019
more than a week you don't just go well

00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:03,769
it'll only take me a week so it should

00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:05,359
only take you a week listen to them find

00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:07,849
out what variables their factoring in

00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:10,190
maybe you can help solve them maybe they

00:23:07,849 --> 00:23:11,840
were going to do something wrong maybe

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,029
they hadn't learned how to do something

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,840
you know how to do that cuts the time

00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:20,630
cost arguing over no I want it now

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,429
wanted in a week and just leaving them

00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:24,679
to try and get it done in a week is

00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:27,260
setting them up for failure you wouldn't

00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,059
do that for math you would go over the

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,580
variables you would include them and you

00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:36,529
would come to the same answer he would

00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:39,169
agree first okay so it is it time to

00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:41,059
sell after that scare Shawn and Kenzie

00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:44,650
want to weigh their options how much

00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:47,779
money would they have if they sold now

00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:50,240
shawn says a thousand dollars Kenzie

00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:52,789
choice shawn says negative a thousand

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,919
dollars Kenzie says six six thousand

00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:57,320
dollars and I'm wondering if without me

00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:59,510
showing the work does anyone know how

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:07,570
they got such different numbers does

00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:13,039
this jump out at anyone yes exactly

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:18,130
exactly it Sean calculated and the total

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:20,450
value of the investment over time Kenzie

00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:25,460
calculated how much money they would get

00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:27,080
back if they sold the stuff so the

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,940
principle behind this example is make

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,640
sure you're saving following the same

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,429
problem and sometimes we get into

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,169
arguments where this is one of those

00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:39,049
where where the phrase violently

00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:43,159
agreeing comes up a lot of the time

00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:48,890
because you might be talking about well

00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:50,510
I mean they could do wrong way they

00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,789
could do this they could be violently

00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:56,059
agreeing they're both right they're just

00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:57,620
saying it in different ways kenzi's

00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:00,320
right that they will get six thousand

00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,240
dollars put into their bank account sean

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,100
is right but will be down a thousand

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,740
dollars so while they're having the

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:10,370
argument trying to decide whether or not

00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:16,460
to sell or key it's important for them

00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:18,140
to recognize what matters to them what

00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,760
matters to Kenzie is you know what it's

00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,970
six thousand dollars more than what we

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,980
had in the bank today you will have six

00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:29,390
thousand extra dollars we can take that

00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:31,670
vacation whereas Shawn's value argument

00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,620
the angle he is coming out

00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:35,870
from is but we'll be down a thousand

00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,820
dollars so which problem do they want to

00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,920
solve do they want to have the six

00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:43,580
thousand dollars or do they want to have

00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,800
a return on their investment who's right

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:52,130
depends on which problems they're

00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:54,860
trained cells so anyone have any

00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:57,110
real-world examples of where they hit

00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:00,140
this kind of problem where you've ended

00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:02,750
up arguing with someone and it turns out

00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:13,340
you both had good ideas that was trying

00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:17,050
to solve different problems and of

00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,050
course this is okay Tom yes

00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:14,030
that's I have I hit that term all the

00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:16,790
time with my ex-husband and his new wife

00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:19,610
actually we were having family dinner

00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:23,780
which we do so the kids understand we're

00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:26,960
all cool and we were actually trying to

00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:29,750
solve a math problem and he had done the

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,470
math differently and wrong he had taken

00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:36,890
the wrong approach um but so we were

00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:39,470
both agreeing on what should happen but

00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:41,750
he was saying no you know we shouldn't

00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,340
subtract this we should add this and I

00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:46,690
was saying you know we should add this

00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:49,580
not subtract this but we hadn't actually

00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:51,919
established the base of what we were

00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,299
adding or subtracting 2 and so it turns

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,299
out we were talking about the exact same

00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:57,890
thing and she could tell this and so she

00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:59,270
was sitting there laughing at us going

00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:03,260
wow I can see why you guys aren't

00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:06,620
married a day before um and it happens

00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:09,700
at Mozilla all the time too and making

00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:11,960
sure you're solving the same problem and

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,970
when people talk for some reason my

00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,850
brain comes up with his example back to

00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:19,520
that you know someone might say I have

00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:22,190
this really great idea and and the team

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,230
leader is is thinking well I'm trying to

00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:28,070
solve this problem I need to get this

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:30,230
ship and they see that that suggestion

00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,549
doesn't actually solve the problem so

00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,320
they might actually talk to the person

00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:36,260
well that's not a bad idea this doesn't

00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:39,890
meet these goals we don't have time to

00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:41,929
invest in that but if you recognize that

00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:43,400
you know what this is actually a

00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:45,710
separate instead of saying no this is a

00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:48,890
bad idea if you recognize no this is a

00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:50,600
different idea you know this doesn't

00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,919
apply to the situation but that doesn't

00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,080
make it a wrong idea that doesn't make

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,429
it a bad idea recognizing that you're

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,770
trying to solve two different problems

00:29:55,429 --> 00:30:00,140
and stop trying to treat the solution as

00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,730
a potential solution to the first

00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,000
problem which of course it's not going

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,000
to call

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:14,330
oh thank you my children are 15 and 13

00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:32,030
mmm um yes yes and that that is a good

00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:34,260
to thinking inside the box on this one I

00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:36,179
would love if you can write a math

00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:44,400
problem that has to do with savings

00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:50,100
bonds yeah hey life if you can write up

00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:52,350
a problem I can add it to the slide so

00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,929
I'm out of the examples but I have a few

00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:59,299
more concept that I I really would have

00:30:54,929 --> 00:31:02,460
loved to have math problem examples and

00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:05,640
but i'll just talk about them and i

00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:08,640
don't know how many of you have ever

00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,770
watched dr phil and i don't know how

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:16,559
many is you used to watch him in the 90s

00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:19,020
before he got all trashy but um you know

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,820
this is another good principle that I

00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:23,850
didn't put into a slide but anyone can

00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:25,230
be right and so using the dr phil

00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,360
example i think a lot of you if you

00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,860
watch the show recently you would think

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,620
that guy does not know what he's talking

00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,120
about well it's sort of we wouldn't

00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,919
treat people that way with math though

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,360
we would look at the work we wouldn't

00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:38,250
say oh you suck at math you couldn't

00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,720
possibly have gotten the right number if

00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,490
they're giving the right number we would

00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,530
go back to the principles from soon the

00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:46,770
first two examples we would say well

00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:49,080
let's see your work so when he had a few

00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:51,419
gems of wisdom that really resonated

00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,850
with me and this is one thing he would

00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:55,650
say to arguing couples all the time do

00:31:53,850 --> 00:32:00,299
you want to be right or do you want to

00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:01,950
be happy and and how this applies to to

00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:04,500
math is because of course you want to be

00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,270
right one its math but you is it more

00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,309
important for you to be the person that

00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:10,880
came up with the right answer or is it

00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:15,240
more important to have the right answer

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,860
so through these visa examples Sean and

00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,600
Kenzie are a lot better off if they

00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,820
focus on getting to the answer that

00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,490
works

00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,630
I then hung who came up with the idea

00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:26,120
you know the times that Kennedy was

00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:28,250
wrong they'd be screwed if they just

00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,500
went along with what she wanted to do

00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,690
just the same thing as the times that

00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,670
Shawn was wrong that Sean was like

00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,500
knowing that's lots more and asked me

00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:40,610
and then they were hacked you know

00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:42,920
there's repercussions so it doesn't

00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,620
matter that Shawn wasn't the one that

00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,910
wanted to buy the extra widgets talk it

00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,610
was a good thing that they did because

00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:53,960
the Rays in the widget stock helps

00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:55,370
absorb the loss in the acne stop so

00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:00,050
they're both better off they're both

00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:01,520
happy so who cares right and that's

00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:04,220
something that we apply a lot with math

00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,560
and I think if we're doing math together

00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:12,110
unless we end up being the one that's

00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:14,510
wrong a lot and where we pay a lot more

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:17,630
attention to let's get the right answer

00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:19,730
we don't sit there value judging the

00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:27,250
answer based off of of who gave the

00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:29,300
answer and this one I wish I had a map

00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:32,330
example for this one I could not find

00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:34,550
one you can't rationalize with someone

00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,110
that's irrational you can't treat a

00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:38,690
rational numbers like they're rational

00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:42,020
you can't treat irrational people like

00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:45,200
their rationale and my my real world

00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:47,660
example again is my ex after he moved

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:52,580
out I noticed a pattern in a lot of our

00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:54,740
sites we all get more frustrated intense

00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:58,370
when we're tired and sick and this is

00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:01,550
really true for him but he's a really

00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:04,910
smart guy and he's a very rational

00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:07,880
person most of the time and so it would

00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:10,520
take me a while I would not recognize

00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:13,040
the signs that he was coming down with a

00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,600
cold he hadn't had enough sleep he's in

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,530
an irrational state because it looked

00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:20,720
very similar to his rational state so we

00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:23,690
would end up fighting for hours we would

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,360
have our worst fight when he was in the

00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,250
state and I can only disclaim where I

00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,140
can only speak from my perspective I am

00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,350
NOT claiming that i was never irrational

00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,710
either I can only talk about my point of

00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,770
view

00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:39,050
and from my point of view that's when we

00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:42,349
would have the worst fight was when I

00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:43,460
was trying to rationalize with him when

00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:45,679
he was irrationally would fight for

00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:49,460
hours we would yell we screamed someone

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,200
we believe the house now when we're

00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,050
having arguments say on user support

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,060
forums or in real life one thing we want

00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:59,900
to say to people all the time is your

00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:01,839
irrational you need to calm down while

00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,690
we all know how well that works right

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:09,080
the real solution that that I figured

00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:12,260
out is recognizing when he is in that

00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:16,609
state and accepting that he's in that

00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:18,349
state and changing my behavior because

00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:20,270
what's the point it just makes both of

00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:22,250
us miserable so I would realize okay

00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,869
cool i'm going to email you will talk

00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:28,040
about it tomorrow and then we would and

00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:34,460
it would be great and it would be fun so

00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:36,349
um you know and as much as as I my third

00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,690
bullet point here is the big point I

00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:40,700
used to get really mad at him you know

00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:42,710
you're a smart person you have all this

00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,530
reasons why aren't you paying attention

00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:48,339
to logic why aren't you using logic well

00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:51,920
guess what that didn't solve the problem

00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:55,099
learning to accept it and and be like

00:35:51,920 --> 00:36:00,550
okay you know what we all get that way

00:35:55,099 --> 00:36:03,530
it's totally fine so he's a cute little

00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:06,460
we don't do that with numbers we accept

00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:09,950
them for what they are and we alter our

00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:13,780
tactics and our expectations based on

00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:20,180
accepting the problems for what they are

00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:23,200
so that was the last thought I had did

00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:23,200
anyone yeah please

00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:59,410
that's okay I did that a few times up

00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,410
here you can do it up

00:38:57,329 --> 00:39:05,470
okay I want to recap make sure I got

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:11,500
your right you're talking and open

00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:17,710
source from a learning aspect and sorry

00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:30,460
so fill me again yeah codes are open so

00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:46,210
everyone can see mmm yes okay yes okay

00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:47,890
yes yes yes okay great and so you're

00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:50,920
talking about that we could use some of

00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:53,170
the principles I've gone over and apply

00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,759
them to how we write the code so that

00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:58,390
it's more clear for people who are

00:39:54,759 --> 00:40:00,910
coming along and and learning and that's

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:04,180
great when I realized I realized how I

00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:06,089
should have done done the math I copied

00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:12,849
the math from from the Khan Academy

00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:17,079
video for this one and I realized what I

00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:19,630
should have done was and this is the

00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:24,630
mouse pointer show yes what I should

00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:26,980
have done was rearranged both of these I

00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:32,019
should have rearranged both of these two

00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:34,539
equal 100 x and then made them equal

00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:37,299
each other and that would have been a

00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:39,099
lot clearer for the person who who

00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:41,829
lovely came down and helped me argue

00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:47,980
this because this isn't clear what the

00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:50,680
heck I did so yeah that's a great point

00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,460
and another point with math too is if if

00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,470
someone come

00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:57,030
along and with a math problem they're

00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:57,030
trying to solve and they ask for help

00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:03,550
sometimes we say I can't help you right

00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:06,310
now or go figure it out yourself but we

00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:07,690
also at that point we we understand why

00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,580
they get upset with us or they're

00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:13,930
frustrated but I need to figure this out

00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:16,600
I mean it's pretty simple to to teach

00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:18,880
them oh ok you made this mistake here or

00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:21,220
you need I see why you couldn't solve

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,740
this you need to learn this contest and

00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:25,740
I move on I sorry the person behind you

00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,790
yeah

00:41:48,260 --> 00:42:02,420
okay can you give me a bit more details

00:41:51,390 --> 00:42:05,420
in the example so I'm sure that ok right

00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,420
yes

00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:29,450
yeah yeah yeah mm-hmm right right okay

00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:42,780
yeah okay yes that's awesome and so so

00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:44,820
we're talking about the instance where

00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,350
you've got someone who needs help with

00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,600
an answer and you've got someone who's

00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:51,390
very confident they know what the answer

00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:55,650
is but it turns out they're wrong and

00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:57,780
and maybe if you had known about their

00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:00,690
skills before hand he would have been

00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:10,670
better been able to predict that that

00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:13,670
this isn't the person to trust hmm yeah

00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,670
yeah

00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:45,290
yes yes yes yeah so what what the

00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:48,310
response was and so if you're in that

00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:50,510
situation where you realized you you've

00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:53,720
accepted an answer that turned out to be

00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:55,760
wrong you can bring in more resources so

00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:58,010
for example I cure' example learning a

00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:08,620
math or the other suggestion what's

00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:15,560
bringing in another person yeah yeah

00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:21,020
mmhmm yeah yeah yeah I'm using the

00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:23,180
principles and from from this at some

00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:25,370
point you'll realize you'll go back and

00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,870
check your work and use the two of you

00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:29,900
will be sitting together checking the

00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:32,420
work and one of you will catch on that

00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:34,520
either we made a mistake with this

00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:37,970
number or we don't know how to handle

00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:40,880
this number so if you're both going into

00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:42,020
it from from the point of view as we

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,840
just want to get the right answer

00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:47,210
because it sounds like you're dealing

00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:50,090
with someone who wants to be right not

00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:51,530
happy so maybe your question is how do

00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:55,300
you handle it when you're dealing with

00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:59,090
someone who wants to be right not happy

00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:01,460
so um you were talking about breaking

00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:03,260
down the problem into chunks so breaking

00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:05,870
that problem down into chunks is is

00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:11,290
first of all trying to understand why

00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:13,610
they care about being right and maybe

00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:15,800
maybe they always lose this fight at

00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:18,740
home and goddammit they just want to win

00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:21,350
at once and you might have to help them

00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:25,160
understand how why it's more valuable to

00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:29,060
them to be happy then it's for them to

00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,470
be right and then also breaking down

00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,180
simply the math

00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:34,010
you can't solve you have broken it down

00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:36,500
you handled the parts you can handle

00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:38,840
you've isolated out the parts you

00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,359
already know how to isolate out and then

00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:45,260
you you can use that information to at

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,460
least see what help you need okay we

00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,190
thought we could handle this that we

00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:55,040
can't we need to deal with someone who

00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:56,990
knows how to handle this which I guess

00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,590
your point is let this become cyclical

00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:17,800
at some point you have to trust someone

00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:17,800
yeah mm-hmm yes Tom

00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,010
thank you

00:48:42,170 --> 00:49:00,569
yeah yeah yeah so this is all all along

00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:02,279
the same lines there are resources that

00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:17,390
you can turn to you and you know what

00:49:02,279 --> 00:49:21,359
that yes yeah that's that's true so

00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:23,969
definitely and in that would be a really

00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:30,859
great lesson for these two is maybe they

00:49:23,969 --> 00:49:30,859
should have gone to an expert and yes

00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:56,779
yes yeah

00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:13,880
yeah yeah yeah but just just to wrap

00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:15,619
that up um thank you for asking that

00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,839
question in the first place that would

00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:21,289
be an awesome slide to add I should have

00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:23,269
a question what they're both wrong what

00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:26,059
happens because that that happens all

00:50:23,269 --> 00:50:28,670
the time especially an open source

00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:30,109
especially for myself I don't code so i

00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:33,650
have a lot of ideas that i can't

00:50:30,109 --> 00:50:35,599
implement myself so i might have a small

00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:37,549
group me or a couple people we're all

00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:41,449
really interested in it maybe someone

00:50:37,549 --> 00:50:44,239
has some coding skills but we know what

00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:47,179
we need to get it off the ground but

00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:52,809
none of us are capable of it or we have

00:50:47,179 --> 00:50:52,809
no clue and we know we have no clue yes

00:50:53,199 --> 00:51:09,589
stack overflow yeah yes yes yeah so so

00:51:03,429 --> 00:51:12,589
yeah yeah yeah so add a real world

00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:14,869
example and for those of you who are

00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:16,880
actually in this session to learn how to

00:51:14,869 --> 00:51:20,019
be more successful dealing with open

00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,099
source stack overflow is a website that

00:51:20,019 --> 00:51:23,359
that's been recommended that you can

00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:25,309
take problems you don't know how to

00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,079
solve maybe you don't have a large

00:51:25,309 --> 00:51:28,670
mozilla community behind you where you

00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:30,400
can go to this new group or that news

00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:33,769
group instead of the one you're in and

00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:37,009
so that's awesome that's a really great

00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:39,499
lesson and math is math is math there

00:51:37,009 --> 00:51:40,910
are right answers just because you don't

00:51:39,499 --> 00:51:42,859
have the right answer doesn't mean you

00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:45,019
can't get it but sometimes you need to

00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:48,079
expand your scope you need to learn more

00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:49,819
or you have to ask for help and thats

00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,279
not totally happens all the time with

00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:54,739
arguments on line is people want to

00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:56,359
resolve it among themselves because and

00:51:54,739 --> 00:51:59,140
then again that kind of gets back to you

00:51:56,359 --> 00:52:02,709
because I want the value of being right

00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:06,249
instead of the value of of being happy

00:52:02,709 --> 00:52:06,249
okay are we

00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:16,310
oh we have Seneca and the water heater a

00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:18,580
tap saw i would like to thank you for

00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:18,580
