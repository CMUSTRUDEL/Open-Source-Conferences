	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,880
technology which is 27 working so how

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,570
much further I'd like to introduce and

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:19,920
ravine and Christopher Martin pietÃ 

00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:22,560
talking about yeah all right okay good

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,480
morning i'm christopher marquis de and i

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,119
have recently joined the Oh step team

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,580
here at Seneca College this fall I'm

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,439
currently working on improving our

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,920
networks infrastructure and backup

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,950
system as well as adding an IPM I system

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,160
under open stock control and helping

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,789
Andrew green with testing pedorra on the

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,000
raspberry pi all right arm as our

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,789
presenter well our introduce a said my

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,969
name is andrew i worked for seedot I've

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,770
been working on releasing a customized

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,739
version of fedora for the Raspberry Pi

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:04,260
called Pandora and that's like my main

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:06,180
booty right now and um we're well ok

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,710
just sauna I'm gonna get a shy hands how

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:14,010
many people are familiar with arm oh

00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:17,850
okay I wasn't expecting that and how

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:26,700
many people aren't all right so all one

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:28,439
person okay so I just um so I decided to

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,420
give this presentation basically just

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,430
because when I explain to people I know

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,950
like what it is a go at work they don't

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,150
really understand what arm devices or

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,909
what it's used for not understanding

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,700
that they're basically in everything

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:46,590
that we use today small devices and such

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:49,430
so um start off by saying what is in our

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,680
impressive processor does anyone know

00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:57,149
now can you give me a brief definition

00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:02,369
of what you think it is I yeah it is

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:05,820
yeah it's all it's basically a advanced

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:08,399
risk machine and what risk machines are

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:13,040
is there reduce instruction on reduce

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,500
instruction set computers right and um

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,299
does this mean exactly well they're

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,090
really designed to design for

00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:23,659
performance right and there they perform

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:27,379
a limited set of operational operations

00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:31,280
I'm extremely kuya so their main focus

00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:38,590
is speed and efficiency our muses on the

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:42,319
risk approached processing sorry yeah

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:45,079
all right some brief background in arm

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,709
is they it was designed in Cambridge the

00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:51,470
first arm processor in the UK originally

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:54,799
these processes weren't familiar outside

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,870
the UK because they were really used for

00:02:54,799 --> 00:03:01,459
educational purposes and stuff like that

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:04,340
but in 1987 the first commercial arm

00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:06,349
processor was released does anybody know

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:14,870
what that device was or the computer

00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:33,409
that was released in 1987 ah correct so

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:37,340
um sorry I got a picture all right yeah

00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:39,799
that's basically what it is um so in the

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:43,159
early 90s arm separated from its parent

00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,470
company to form arm limited which is the

00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:48,769
company we now know today forearm which

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:51,940
is synonymous alarm actually um this two

00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:54,829
basic approaches when it comes to

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,959
creating a processor which is the risk

00:03:54,829 --> 00:04:00,319
approach and the cisco approach our

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,939
muses the risk approach which is on they

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,799
fold like I said they focus on speed and

00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:08,090
doing things fast and efficiently

00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:10,459
whereas sis works on it's that what's it

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:16,459
stands for complex instructional step

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:19,120
computing right sorry for those is

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,120
getting a little her

00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:26,710
so Intel well arms is like the Risso

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,539
prochik I said Intel uses the cisco

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,449
approach to develop their processors and

00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:33,430
they're basically they want to build the

00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:44,139
fastest and strongest chips for the

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:46,120
industry um yeah well I guess I kinda

00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:48,550
already spoke about this but I guess

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,810
said risk is is basically built for

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:55,120
speed and efficiency and Sisk is more

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:58,979
complex it has more computational power

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,840
but they're generally less efficient arm

00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:05,400
some of the advantages to arm devices

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,139
are that they have smaller die sizes and

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,530
I'm not sure if you're familiar with

00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:13,389
what a die size actually is it's just

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:18,599
basically the technical term for the

00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:18,599
actual wafer that the trip goes on to so

00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:28,090
what ya chokes alright so when you have

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,159
a smaller die size that basically makes

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,319
the chip perform faster because the

00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:35,949
smaller than actual die size is the

00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:38,500
better yet in performance right another

00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:41,949
advantage the arm is well here's an

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,740
example of a small die sighs it's used

00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:47,289
on the Raspberry Pi which I'm sure many

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,599
of you have already seen at least here

00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:54,880
at seneca just pretty small about the

00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:57,430
size of a credit card yeah so alright so

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,199
another advantage is development time

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,870
you can develop our arm chip quicker

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:06,279
than you could develop like Intel

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:09,009
processor basically so one of the main

00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:12,099
advantages to doing this is that as the

00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:15,130
generation grab gaps like as generations

00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:19,630
of devices come out the power the power

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:21,219
and arm this like they basically scale

00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,020
up they get better and better over time

00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:26,560
faster because of these shorter

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:30,270
development times also ARM chip size is

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,580
another important aspect of developing a

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,110
cost-effective on processor basically

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,090
here

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,850
chip size though the higher the yield

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,500
right and how this works is when you

00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:43,260
have a bigger processor you have more

00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,370
chances of getting defects with like per

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,720
chip right the smaller it is the the

00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:52,590
lesser chance of there being defects

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:56,130
there in production so um this directly

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,560
equates to like / costs like it makes

00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:02,670
chips cheaper to develop the smaller

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,280
they are here's an example of the a5

00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:08,910
processor that Apple uses in their iPad

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,420
is like is tons of processors out there

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:15,180
that are available in we use them in our

00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:19,770
everyday devices arms our sales pitch

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:23,280
basically goes like this arm it has the

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:25,620
best MIPS to watch ratio which is on its

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,150
at well MIPS if you don't know what that

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,290
stands for is Millie instructions per

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:34,110
second and the they're generally used to

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:36,290
measure the like how good a chip is like

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,240
how well it will perform li the value of

00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:46,680
that particular chip right so the better

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:49,530
to ratio the better the chip is armed so

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,320
this translates into more savings so you

00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:55,530
get more bang for your buck with a good

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,490
arm lips to watch ratio so manufacturers

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,690
use this to measure the cost of actually

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:07,950
but this is basically the cost of

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:10,830
computing so um another another

00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,620
important aspect of their sales pitch is

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,380
that arm processors are low powered so

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,900
in my opinion this is their main selling

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,580
point is that you who wants a device

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,860
that's going to die every two seconds

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,090
but can calculate a lot it is you have

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,520
to charge it every second you got

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,290
plugged in so they make a lot of money

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,480
based on their little power consumption

00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,550
so putting this all together with us

00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,560
with a small die size shorter

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,590
development times smaller hardware and

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:48,300
low power consumption you it all equals

00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:51,780
the one cost effective processor so um

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,060
as you can see here arms dominated the

00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,620
mobile market with processes leaving

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,200
intel on the dust because they barely

00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,230
produce any armed ships at all there's a

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,550
few out there that they use arm one way

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,740
that are makes their money is by

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,440
licensing the designs of these chips to

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,260
specific companies like Samsung and

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,210
Apple and various other companies so

00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,550
they don't actually compete directly

00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:17,040
with the manufacturers they make money

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:23,730
based on like their licenses and

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:26,250
royalties and stuff like that so arm my

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,470
next slide here shows basically arms

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:32,280
where arms going in the future this is

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,630
they have the greatest storm market

00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,000
share is going to be basically an

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,850
embedded on application such as credit

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,460
cards washing machines automobiles and

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,800
on they saw they could sell the chip for

00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:46,170
anywhere between a dollar it's a dollar

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,930
to two dollars per device right which is

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:53,670
very low arm they can also compete with

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:55,230
Intel's like Intel processors right with

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,330
their higher end chips that solve for

00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,700
about twenty-five dollars part of the

00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:03,630
reason our makes so much money is not in

00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,190
share sales but sorry not sales they

00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,110
don't make as much money as Intel does

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:09,540
per chip but they sell a lot more

00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,030
processors than until does so that's

00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:15,450
where they make most of their money and

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:18,030
um Chris is gonna take over from here

00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:21,780
he's going to get a little bit more

00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:29,610
technical than I was with this way get

00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:32,490
this okay so arm-based devices a lot of

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:39,390
devices these days use ARM processors

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:47,270
can anyone here named of you yes right

00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:53,220
oh yeah some of them do yeah anyone else

00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:55,200
yes of course yeah so um there are a

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,370
bunch of different devices that are used

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,560
with

00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:02,070
arm-based processors including

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:06,360
smartphones gps navigators even cameras

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:08,130
and tablets of course next year arm will

00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,670
be releasing its newest line of

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:16,980
processors the cortex a57 and cortex a53

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:19,470
these will be based on the arm vh

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,350
architecture with which will now consist

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,560
of both 64-bit and 32-bit execution

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:28,610
states it will be the most

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:32,240
energy-efficient 64-bit platform because

00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:34,380
it will be faster in terms of

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,560
floating-point operations and

00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:45,570
cryptography and it will be faster than

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:48,029
arm v7 obviously the cortex a57 will be

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:51,150
about will have a noticeable increase

00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:54,560
about twenty to thirty percent in terms

00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:57,630
of performance over the cortex a15 and

00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,450
it will use the same power consumption

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:03,209
and will be three times faster than the

00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:06,930
leading edge system on a chip from the

00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:10,470
mobile market the cortex a53 will

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:13,020
however be in the same terms of

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,750
performance as today's smartphones but

00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:19,050
will only consume about a quarter of the

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:22,529
energy these new processors will be

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:25,380
using 28-nanometer transistors and

00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:28,310
eventually shrink to 20 nanometers and

00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,930
then 40 nanometers in the future as

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,779
Andrew green mentioned before shrinking

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,860
the die size will help improve power

00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:39,839
efficiency and performance even more a

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:42,980
lot of companies have already started

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:47,580
licensing this new generation of cortex

00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:50,000
a15 the hopes to release their newest

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:57,300
products with this new generation

00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:00,270
architecture in 2014 ok so these

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,640
processors can be set up in a big little

00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,720
configuration which allows for the

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,660
maximum CPU performance as well as the

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:12,000
most power-efficient CPU

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,790
or anywhere in between depending on how

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,050
much performance is required the arm's

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:21,720
big.little our configuration combines

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:24,300
the most powerful CPU and the most

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,200
power-efficient CPU big.little

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,760
processing allows for instant dynamic

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,100
transitioning of the CPU based on the

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,680
performance required so this is a lot

00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:38,850
like your Nvidia Optimus technology

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,710
where you can dynamically change your

00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,570
integrated graphics with your dedicated

00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:47,070
graphics depending on what your

00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:49,410
application wants this will be really

00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,620
fast so fast that it's seamless to the

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,420
user and could potentially reduce power

00:13:52,620 --> 00:14:05,690
consumption by as much as seventy

00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:08,640
percent so design of arm does not design

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:11,340
sorry arm does not build these chips but

00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:14,670
rather designs them so there are other

00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:17,580
companies like Samsung and Qualcomm who

00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:21,300
actually build these CPUs based off of

00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:23,550
arms designs such as the Snapdragon and

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,700
external processors in today's

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,110
smartphones and tablets

00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:32,850
telecommunications is one of the fastest

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:35,580
growing industries in the world today

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:38,010
you can use your smartphone for creating

00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:41,610
content instead of using your desktop or

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:44,070
laptop you can simply capture create and

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:47,010
edit your photos and videos directly

00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:49,140
from your smartphone or tablet now

00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,090
writing documents might seem a bit

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,000
tricky on a touchscreen for most people

00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,940
but you can simply connect a keyboard or

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,980
a mouse or even a large high-definition

00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,200
display to your arm based device and

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:06,060
it's pretty much a laptop or desktop

00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:11,550
replacement now the iphone 5s was the

00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:14,310
first 64-bit based smartphone as many of

00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,750
you probably know that but next year in

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:18,930
the next generation of smart phones

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:22,520
coming out there will be a ton more so

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,520
look forward to that and

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:29,070
the widespread popularity of these

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:33,680
devices arm-based devices have increased

00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:36,960
the the need for developers to create

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,400
cross architecture support between x86

00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,080
processors and arm-based processors

00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:48,030
arm-based processors cannot necessarily

00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:50,220
run x86 applications natively and even

00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:54,600
if it were possible it's not going to

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:58,410
happen anytime soon x86 processors are

00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,530
more powerful but they're not very

00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:03,270
efficient so arm-based processors are

00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:06,210
catching up in terms of performance and

00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:16,860
the are more efficient and they will

00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:19,830
catch up eventually yeah sorry these new

00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:23,090
processors do feature full hardware

00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:25,860
virtualization so many of you know that

00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:27,810
hardware virtualization means you can

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,560
access your system resources

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:34,890
simultaneously in terms of servers this

00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,740
means you can actively run multiple

00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,600
operating systems on a single machine

00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,810
but besides servers this is also

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,110
relevant to other markets like for

00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:49,260
instance many automotive manufacturers

00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:53,310
use arm-based engine control units in

00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:56,670
their vehicles so this can be very

00:16:53,310 --> 00:17:00,570
useful because if a certain module in

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:02,010
your car fails the rest of the car is

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,840
not going to break down on you it's

00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:06,360
still going to run because the rest of

00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:09,720
your components are isolated and they're

00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:13,110
not going to be harmed and your

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:17,780
smartphones as well because but say for

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:21,360
instance you have your typical apps like

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,490
Facebook and candy crush and you're also

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,970
a business person you don't want your

00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:29,040
enterprise applications to be exposed to

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,570
those apps and you don't want Facebook

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:36,700
to have access to your private

00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:38,380
information we're going to pass out some

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,100
arm devices that we use heard cidade I

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:44,380
guess if you're interested in seeing up

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:48,300
so do i do we got any questions or

00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,300
anything you guys want clarification on

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:56,860
yeah you would have to return um so that

00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,440
they handed all right there is a kelsey

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,970
de Burgh we're actually we got a few

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,130
them downstairs that we're using to

00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:07,570
build pyro that's our I believe that's

00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:10,900
our fastest on arm device this is the

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:14,860
BeagleBone oh you can just passive

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:25,030
aggres yeah um sorry there's more

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:28,800
questions I know for sure that it will

00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:32,380
be fully compatible with the our arm v7

00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,990
32-bit applications I'm not so sure

00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:45,960
about arm v6 but i'm sure the same

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:48,370
applies there i think it would depend on

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,480
certain features i know a lot of arm v7

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:54,520
like the cortex a15 does have hardware

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,970
virtualization but if that was required

00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:00,580
in some other processors maybe not I

00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:09,520
don't know if the arm b6 could handle

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:12,370
that right sure right so our makes a

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,130
bunch of different CPUs and their naming

00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:17,860
convention is that sorry they design

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:21,880
them and they make their different line

00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:25,930
of cortex such as cortex a9 cortex a15

00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,520
and now the cortex a57 and 53 which is a

00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,800
bit confusing because in terms of

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,480
performance yeah they're not always goal

00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,580
like you think the higher number would

00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:37,050
be the fastest ship yeah not always the

00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:39,190
case but that's not name yeah

00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:42,760
necessarily all right and sometimes it

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:46,170
means more energy efficiency in the long

00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,170
run yeah

00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:11,750
well until wouldnt say that they're

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,790
panicking right now but I think they

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:17,000
have a pretty big competition on their

00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:19,460
hands right now arm is still like

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,070
increasing in popularity even today

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,510
until based servers I mean they're still

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,300
around and they're still the most

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:29,510
popular on notebooks desktops and

00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:32,660
servers but I think arm is making their

00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:34,730
way up the ladder yeah I i think for

00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,950
knowledge because like the technology is

00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,630
fairly new it's you until it's like

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,250
tried tested and true you're not they're

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,590
not really going to be we're right at

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,720
the moment but and then the technology

00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,580
gets better faster more efficient it's

00:20:44,720 --> 00:21:12,830
definitely going to be a competitor in

00:20:46,580 --> 00:21:14,900
the server market in my opinion that's

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:31,250
above my knowledge okay I couldn't

00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:53,600
comment on that because I yeah okay I

00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:57,290
think I understand we're saying ya go

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,800
but I have this expression I'm not it

00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:03,190
I have this impression that each

00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:05,870
boundary has their own recipes for

00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,940
manufacturing semiconductors and the

00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,770
different scaling world all sorts of

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:15,260
crazy nights like that so the more

00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:17,210
specific you are yeah yeah but there's

00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,790
different versions like there's a lot of

00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,860
different various like varieties of

00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:25,010
armed processes right so that would most

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:27,470
like you address what you're saying I i

00:22:25,010 --> 00:23:01,270
think it was um yeah question in New

00:22:27,470 --> 00:23:03,890
Mexico right okay yeah well that's the

00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:06,920
64-bit versions of arm that's coming out

00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:09,020
that Christmas talking about I'm it's it

00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,360
should be a right it will actually use

00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,760
larger on instruction so they're really

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,160
just trying to bring in 64-bit now

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,370
because they want people to start using

00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,910
it and a lot of servers nowadays already

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:25,840
use 64-bit applications so this is sort

00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:43,880
of going to future-proof it for later on

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:46,100
yes yeah right right in fact that's

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,860
probably the main reason right 64-bit

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,950
everyone knows okay if I have a 64-bit

00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:55,300
machine I can now support more than four

00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:58,370
gigs of ram but most arm-based devices

00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:01,340
like smartphones don't feature more than

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,530
two gigs I know the new samsung galaxy

00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,810
note 3 is probably the largest it has

00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:08,180
three gigs so right now it's not very

00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:11,080
important but it will be in the next few

00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:13,000
years I think but aside from that

00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:17,019
the 64-bit support will give you a

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,390
larger virtual memory address space so

00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:28,269
for applications that need it they can

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:31,390
take advantage of it okay well then I

00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:32,710
was incorrect I'm saying that they use

00:24:31,390 --> 00:25:03,210
the address space is what i meant

00:24:32,710 --> 00:25:03,210
problem well somebody had a question

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:20,620
yeah that it's a cortex a15 I believe

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:24,820
it's a it's not the newest generation of

00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:28,110
arm cortex cpu but it does have 64-bit

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:31,240
support so it's kind of on the lines of

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:37,200
innovation but it's not arms latest

00:25:31,240 --> 00:26:00,220
technology any more questions

00:25:37,200 --> 00:26:03,010
clarifications yeah you don't know well

00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:07,779
that's one of our end arm devices right

00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:11,350
and it supports I believe like you can

00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:16,840
actually put RAM on the board itself

00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:19,720
right yeah yeah it goes into era losing

00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:23,590
it well okay it's in our veredus chassis

00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,909
in the armory down at CDOT it's running

00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,529
in addition with

00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:29,590
through other cards that are basically

00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:33,879
our builders for building packages for

00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:35,259
pedorra and yeah see he's the info

00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:43,389
structure guy so he deals with the

00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:45,789
hardware more than I do I don't recall

00:26:43,389 --> 00:26:58,889
looking seeing any SD card greeters but

00:26:45,789 --> 00:27:08,409
Riyadh network install oh really yeah

00:26:58,889 --> 00:27:10,479
well it's a sorry what is basically what

00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:13,119
it is the nodes talk about the nose yeah

00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:16,899
it's basically a giant server that can

00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:20,679
fit up to 12 those cards each card has

00:27:16,899 --> 00:27:22,419
four of those associate and you can how

00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:24,159
many okay how many of them are we using

00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:27,190
downstairs are involved right now 12

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:31,059
okay so and on each chip there's four

00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:33,489
nodes for a chip right so how much nodes

00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:36,460
we have all together cause it no rift

00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:39,369
well also we're at four sorry we have

00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:41,769
three cards that hold four nodes on it

00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:44,109
so we have basically are we clustered

00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:45,879
them together to create like one big

00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:48,639
Network missions and their very low

00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:50,519
power they only use about if you had 12

00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:53,619
if you have the whole veredus server

00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:56,409
load it up with these cards you know 12

00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:58,359
cards and I think that's around 50 notes

00:27:56,409 --> 00:28:05,470
that only takes about three hundred

00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:08,889
watts of power consumption so yeah yeah

00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:19,239
oh yeah ah there was a question in the

00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:20,379
mat okay um yeah so sorry didn't you you

00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,649
gotta start again I didn't hear you

00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:22,649
sorry

00:28:55,280 --> 00:30:21,000
yeah these are our proprietary whether

00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:32,270
any not from arm but there are a number

00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:39,539
of places like our orbit arm right well

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:41,690
the rest of our better that but

00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,690
obviously

00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:52,250
there's a very simple ones a quarter is

00:30:47,920 --> 00:31:02,030
gypsum or bit how the work and some

00:30:52,250 --> 00:31:04,130
vendors builders come with my

00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:08,870
understanding go we're kind of losing in

00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:16,240
the marketplace or today this both in

00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:19,100
charge but across all platforms

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,860
weathertech 86 are on or any other pop

00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:25,220
boutique use always a six-point and the

00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:27,560
vendors we get it handed over just even

00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,140
the vendors don't want to fully disclose

00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:33,110
do specters and everybody step on

00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:36,860
everybody else attacks and so they were

00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:42,350
a better massive night Eric Holder the

00:31:36,860 --> 00:32:00,440
funny thing is there are there are these

00:31:42,350 --> 00:32:12,440
simple drivers for pushing that we're

00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:22,120
getting for getting me sick too modern d

00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:22,120
okay um anybody else all right then I

00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:30,140
sure sure one performs be around is for

00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:32,030
obvious large silver gets on it that's

00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:38,140
like how they over there right there

00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:41,680
that's like health Kaleta energy for art

00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:44,120
each of those notes is a quad core

00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:49,130
system on a chip so the entire system

00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:52,910
and has four times ten day event

00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:55,910
multiplex links though each device at

00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:59,030
gigabit of network I oh

00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:01,780
on you can take those cards you can

00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,860
stack the many cards of the chassis each

00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:07,340
partnering for note you should know

00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:10,820
having four boards all connected by this

00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:16,580
this multiple 10 degree bit network

00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:18,370
fabric if that's a piece guide layout

00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:24,320
connector let's knock these guys neck

00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:29,570
project a note on that first you're

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:31,130
running 408 another note by BATS this is

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,770
early case right that that will come

00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:35,630
down as its standpoint what's what's

00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:38,270
really interesting is that the dress

00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:40,520
rehearsal for what's coming next so

00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:43,820
though it's not the cortex a9 level 32

00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:46,910
bit on for next generation report back

00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:50,630
to a 15 next generation after that we're

00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:54,560
talking probably january 2014 time frame

00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:56,870
is pull out of 64 bit and the network

00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:00,230
speed is going to jump up from ending

00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:03,290
fifth something potentially higher so

00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:07,490
we're looking at a situation we have 14

00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:11,030
million aquaphor 64 bit though front

00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:14,030
five min eat watts and have a probably

00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:15,650
hundreds of a bit sipani so that's

00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:19,490
that's what we're looking at it but

00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:27,830
forearm hyperscale server systems about

00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:31,100
a year over all right arm so in

00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:33,410
conclusion i guess our efficiencies of

00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,750
the way of the future so that's really

00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:37,730
what arms all about and it's our

00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:41,260
presentation thank you for coming out

00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:41,260
and enjoy doing it

00:34:51,479 --> 00:35:02,829
the [ __ ] when you walk into a

00:34:54,459 --> 00:35:09,549
presentation may be introducing thank

00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:12,779
you thank you appreciate it this is one

00:35:09,549 --> 00:35:12,779
