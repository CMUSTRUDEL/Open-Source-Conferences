I

00:01:52,000 --> 00:03:28,570
yes yes okay I'll talk about some of the

00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:33,010
standards yes but not upcoming standard

00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:33,010
it's with that what they awarded yes

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,160
yes

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:54,419
I truly wish my students to be this

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:58,530
quiet amazing we should video take me

00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:02,340
there well welcome back sauce for the

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:04,560
whole six screen our next presentation

00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:10,410
very interesting I had a chance to talk

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:13,889
to Bologna elvez he's here on an

00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:16,440
especial exchange with his university in

00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:18,300
Brazil and the University of Toronto and

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,669
something called science Without Borders

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,290
I spend that fascinating like you've

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:24,229
heard of Doctors Without Borders I

00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:28,590
didn't know that there was a science

00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:33,150
beginning to talk with a with Bologna I

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:35,430
I was very taken with with Brazil I knew

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,919
has a fact that Brazil has a healthy

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:40,260
linux authorizations and slowly was

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,300
mentioning that now there when you buy a

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,159
computer linux is pretty much the

00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,320
standard that's on the machines and we

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,810
comes up here it's quite a wake-up call

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,060
I was it's so taken with the discussion

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,250
I think I know where I'm going to go my

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,430
first sabbatical and it's been beat up

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:58,440
result anyways for today's topic of the

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,540
topic is accessibility oriented

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,510
Peregrine for design you user interface

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,850
very interesting topic is as we know in

00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:09,320
terms of the challenges that we face for

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:11,370
accessibility in web pages and uh and

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,020
studies going on foot that today so

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,050
thank you very much too long it let's

00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,779
welcome stalling thanks for the

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:23,400
introduction good morning ladies and

00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:31,529
gentlemen as he has he said I'm

00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Brazilian and Brazilian interactive web

00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:37,890
developer I have experience developing

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:45,060
accessible applications i work at CDOT

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:48,930
here at Seneca College in the summer i'm

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:52,470
also an Adobe certified in web and in

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:54,899
design which which means I'm I'm

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,720
certifying Photoshop

00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,430
Weaver flash illustrator some of the

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:05,459
major tourist tools that are they'll be

00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:09,509
developing our open source geek somehow

00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:12,860
and my agenda for today it is i'll be

00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:15,240
explaining the concept of accessibility

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:19,069
show you some of the guidelines for

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:24,679
accessibility i'll explain some of the

00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:27,720
assistive technologies that users can

00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:31,889
use for make making their lives more

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,980
like making their lives easier I'll

00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:37,319
explain accessibility testings and tools

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:42,360
I'll show you a little demo with some of

00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:45,959
the some websites I'll go through some

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:49,230
standards compliant markup and CSS these

00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:53,610
presentations basically focus on web

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:57,209
development I'll show a few successful

00:10:53,610 --> 00:11:00,300
projects showcase as accessibility is

00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:05,059
very difficult to have had some

00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:08,579
difficulties to be fully implemented and

00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:13,829
those successful projects are not really

00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:18,240
that successful we go some to some final

00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:20,490
thoughts and then I open for a Q&A well

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,329
first of all the concept of

00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:28,079
accessibility I would like to know a

00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:32,870
little bit has anyone here worked for

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:36,929
with accessibility in your project good

00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:40,529
well maybe you have some of some of the

00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:45,059
ideas of x SS believed would be but not

00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:47,970
a full understand so accessibility it it

00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:51,240
aims to allow individuals with

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:55,459
disability chills applications in a

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:59,399
simple manner those accessibilities and

00:11:55,459 --> 00:12:02,069
they can be visual auditory speech

00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:07,079
physical learning cognitive and

00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:08,400
neurological and it affects the in

00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:13,280
affects the way you

00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,280
zehrs interact with the the applications

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:22,770
so something that maybe overlaps in your

00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:26,970
concept is that use accessibility is not

00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:29,070
the same as usability his ability is

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:32,750
designing applications to be more

00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:35,910
effective to be more efficient and

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:38,460
satisfying for all for all but it

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:41,840
doesn't consider specifically those

00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:45,630
users with accessible needs with

00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:50,940
blindness with Parkinson's parts on

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:54,000
disease and dyslexia and it's not the

00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,280
same as device independence it doesn't

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,830
mean that just making our application

00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:03,200
available in small devices with a big

00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:08,970
font a it will be make it accessible and

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:11,660
nor that just making it run in older

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:14,340
browsers will make it accessible

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:17,250
accessibility addresses issues that put

00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:21,780
individuals with disability and any kind

00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:26,730
of disadvantage so the point is to

00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:29,520
remove those disadvantages so I have

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:32,430
some good news and bad news about

00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:36,510
accessibility there is no such thing as

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:39,630
inaccessible whatever you do it will

00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:42,680
never be enacted totally inaccessible at

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:45,870
some point you have some kind of access

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,540
accessibility into it and the bad news

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:53,450
is there is no such a thing as fully

00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:55,680
accessible well exist is it is a range

00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:59,100
you cannot make everything accessible

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:02,460
for everyone but you can make content

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:06,360
more accessible for more people so you

00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:08,100
gotta manage that range what is your

00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,400
what is the platform you are developing

00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:15,750
for what uses you you what is your

00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:19,460
audience who you wants to reach that's

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,460
more like the range of accessibility

00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:26,910
what accessibility would means and with

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,610
applying different standards you will

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:34,070
have greater all as accessibility in

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:37,980
your applications so the benefits of

00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:42,120
accessibility they are fascinating it

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:44,730
provides the co opportunity for giving

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,540
more access to information to more

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:51,930
people and it provides more opportunity

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:54,780
for interaction so you may not only use

00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:57,440
your mouse for interacting with your

00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:00,150
application but you can provide

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:05,060
navigation through the keyboard only as

00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:09,390
a as another option for interacting in

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:12,600
act one of another benefit is that it

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:15,930
makes applications usable considering

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,980
elements such as eyes ears motor control

00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:24,360
perception of color and input devices

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:28,970
you may may think in our application for

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:33,900
someone that doesn't that has blindness

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:36,650
which is which is a making your

00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:40,740
application through the sound like

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:44,010
giving some features for be use only a

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:47,670
visit on sound or on the other hand

00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:53,070
maybe your applications just visual and

00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:58,770
you are not considering people with

00:15:53,070 --> 00:16:02,490
death impairment and accessibly has a

00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:07,610
lot of difficult difficulties there are

00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:11,040
wide implementation differences between

00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:14,070
browsers platforms and even screen

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,680
readers all the browsers and screen

00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:22,350
readers are not likely to handle dynamic

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:25,770
web applications that's a fact and no

00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:28,770
browser or web Oh screen reader has

00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:33,360
fully implemented accepted standards

00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:36,709
like the ones that WT 3c

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,420
uh provides and i'll be talking

00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:44,070
explaining a little bit more all those

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:46,170
standards ahead and there is no clear

00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:49,410
documentation what is widely supported

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:54,149
in all tools maybe you are creating a

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:57,390
little copper box and you to test your

00:16:54,149 --> 00:17:00,839
application using firefox and then you

00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:05,370
open it it looks beautiful but then you

00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:07,429
open in a Chrome browser and then it's

00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:12,540
completely different or it doesn't show

00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:16,829
so you don't even you don't even can

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:19,410
rely you cannot even rely on all the

00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:22,049
tools that we have because it doesn't

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:27,540
mean that if it works in one it will be

00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:29,640
the same in another in another tool so

00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,360
I'll explain you some of the gala

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,660
guidelines things that should be all

00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:43,340
implemented in all platforms in all

00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:47,190
screen readers in all browsers the main

00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:49,650
the main company that the create

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:55,410
standards is the World Wide Web

00:17:49,650 --> 00:18:00,120
Consortium w3c and it's not the it's

00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:03,630
best known for the HTML standards it has

00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:08,270
several focus standards for

00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:10,760
accessibility one of some of them are

00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:16,890
access accessible rich Internet

00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:20,700
applications or area one of at this one

00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:23,790
I'll be going deeper a little a little

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:28,200
more later it defines technology for

00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:35,010
making dynamic web applications it is

00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:36,450
basically some some little attributes

00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,980
and properties that you had for your

00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:45,210
HTML code basically and it gives it

00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:47,160
gives more accessibility features for

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,080
your application

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:54,420
there is the web content accessibility

00:18:49,080 --> 00:19:00,380
guidelines WCAG it is one of the main

00:18:54,420 --> 00:19:02,520
ones we it is based for a lot of laws

00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:05,580
international laws regarding

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,430
accessibility it is guidelines for

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:12,090
creating accessible websites playing

00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:15,630
basic and there is the authoring to

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:18,840
accessibility guideline for developing

00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:22,950
your touring tools those guidelines used

00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:26,760
by companies like Adobe when when they

00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:29,940
think about Dreamweaver or Photoshop in

00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,620
terms of accessibility giving more

00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,400
accessibility features for the tools

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:38,840
their tools and user agent accessibility

00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:44,910
guidelines the guidelines that should be

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:48,560
implemented by Mozilla or Google Chrome

00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:57,240
and Safari all browsers media players

00:19:48,560 --> 00:20:02,430
for facilitating accessible use and one

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:05,780
of the dist Anders here in Canada there

00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:09,300
is the AODA which is accessibility for

00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:11,730
Ontarians with Disabilities Act it's

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,100
like the accessibility requirements in

00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:18,000
several areas including information

00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:23,070
technology it also expands you public

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,910
transportation business ah inclusive

00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:29,370
design in Canada is in part driven by a

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:32,040
background of anti-discrimination laws

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:35,100
such as the Canadian chat Charter of

00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,590
Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,570
Human Rights Act and the common look and

00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,300
feel policy of the Canadian government

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,490
requires it's a web web sites should

00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,580
meet a number of accessibility

00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:49,230
requirements based on web content

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:54,060
accessibility guidelines that we just

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:58,590
saw for example if you i'll be showing

00:20:54,060 --> 00:21:00,999
to if you go to the canadian website the

00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:05,379
website for the government of canada

00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:08,979
you'll be seeing some objects the basic

00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:12,189
was the de meets the accessibility

00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:17,889
requirements of dagga gadlight guideline

00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:21,909
on it and some of the international

00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:26,399
standards they are also beta the

00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:30,969
foundation of accessibility in brazilian

00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:36,309
government applications to its section

00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:38,519
508 and ABA standards as many other

00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:42,609
countries they have their own guidelines

00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:44,799
friends German Japan they they all have

00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:49,299
their own sides of guidelines that they

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:54,099
require the government Apple websites or

00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:56,079
educational platforms and in the US

00:21:54,099 --> 00:22:00,999
there is the American with Disabilities

00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:05,279
Act the ADA a in the section 508 the

00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:07,859
section 508 also incorporates

00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:11,229
accessibility as a requirement for

00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:17,049
buying products that will be used by the

00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:21,059
government and it had it means I'm

00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:21,059
incentive for inclusive design

00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:32,709
accessibility is it's something that is

00:22:28,469 --> 00:22:35,469
important for for especially for

00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:39,839
government to make things clear for

00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:43,809
everybody access accessible for everyone

00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:46,119
and i'll be explaining some of the

00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:54,279
assistive technologies things that we

00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:58,809
have nowadays that users use for making

00:22:54,279 --> 00:23:02,669
their lives as i said easier when

00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:04,470
developers don't consider accessibility

00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:07,020
so we have this

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:11,640
readers and magnifiers for blind and

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:14,760
visually impaired refreshable Braille

00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:20,220
display which is in the picture on the

00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:23,780
left and we have captioning software

00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:27,990
which is used when when you see some

00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:32,370
multimedia presentations on the web when

00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:35,190
like the lecture it's clicking on

00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:37,650
something and there is a little a visual

00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:41,600
sign that were don't that was a click

00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:44,789
and you have voice recognition software

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,780
switches and pointer sticks and touch

00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:53,880
screen for motor impairments so me we'll

00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:59,070
think about of a variety of of tools

00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:01,919
that people use maybe a a pencil for for

00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:05,970
those that can't really type using a

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:10,799
keyboard or all kinds of variations of

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:14,510
those those tools that I presented for

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:19,440
screen readers the ones that are really

00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:24,350
widely used our jaws it this one it is

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:32,880
it's not free it has a license vary from

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:36,169
802 11 11 11 hundred dollars I don't

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:40,260
think it's cheap for providing

00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:43,799
accessibility for for everyone but we

00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:47,010
have a free and some other free tools

00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:50,220
like NVDA which is free for windows in

00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:54,990
Oracle for Linux which is going out to

00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:58,919
bone tool to which is the at least in

00:24:54,990 --> 00:25:02,820
Brazil is the the most common a linux

00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:05,730
distribution being used you have

00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:09,120
voiceover on Mac OS which is free when

00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:12,679
you buy any of the Apple products it is

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:17,070
incorporated in iPads iPhones all make

00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:21,330
all macs all my computers

00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:25,259
chromevox or Chrome OS I'll be also

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:27,360
explaining this this plugin for the

00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:34,470
chrome the browser or the chrome browser

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:38,340
here and as i said that people that can

00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:42,509
use or can't afford for tools like this

00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:45,529
ones they they are a little inventive

00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:52,139
and they may be using keyboards

00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:55,919
navigation as a as a a way for

00:25:52,139 --> 00:25:57,960
facilitate they use oh so instead of

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:02,009
using just the mouse they'll be using

00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:06,629
the keyboard as as their as their two

00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:11,100
are they they may be changing font size

00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:14,549
of of the browser or the system so they

00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,879
can see a little better your web

00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:21,870
application native application or

00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:25,049
changing the browser window or changing

00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:27,629
color settings or even a change your

00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:31,470
style sheets for web applications some

00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:33,600
people think they have their they have

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,059
built their own style and they

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,659
apply for a web application so they

00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:41,850
can't see better your website maybe you

00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:45,269
plan your whole application then they

00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:48,899
just simply replace your stylesheet so

00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:52,860
they they have a like a more standard

00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:56,970
way of reading your application reading

00:26:52,860 --> 00:27:02,909
on website accessibility testing tools

00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:07,350
there your your essential a guideline

00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:10,379
for web development of native web

00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:14,940
development i release recommend you to

00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:18,320
be testing a continuously your

00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:22,409
application using those feet those tools

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,289
some of the ones that I I selected to

00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:28,980
present here its accessibility

00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:30,020
developers to tools these ones are they

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:35,540
are

00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:40,340
they they have google in the background

00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:42,410
hey helping people there is the

00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:45,950
chromevox as i said which is a screen

00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:49,840
reader for blind users and also works in

00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:53,860
the Chrome OS there is the crumb v's

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,990
it's a magnifier for low vision users

00:27:53,860 --> 00:28:00,680
chrome shades this is an interesting one

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:04,100
it gets your application and you can

00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:10,120
kind of simulate how your your website

00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:13,330
would be as it would be seen by up by

00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:17,620
individuals with the different kinds of

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:20,420
disabilities and all these they are

00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:22,760
extensions these extensions they are

00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,740
open source and they are available at

00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:29,510
this website you can also contribute for

00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:37,340
the development of them ah I'll switch

00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:39,980
here for my yeah I when I got here I

00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,890
simply install it was really really easy

00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:46,730
to just go to the website like chromevox

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:50,320
and then add to the chrome browser for

00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:53,480
example if you go here in this menu I

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:57,650
don't think if you go to developers

00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:00,740
tools you when you open a website it

00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:04,760
will show this little panel down here

00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:08,290
and you can audit your web web page you

00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:14,420
know if it's accessible if it has some

00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:16,760
some problems regarding accessibility as

00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:20,630
I said accessibility is quite difficult

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:25,970
to implement somehow and let's see if

00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:28,400
google has access all accessibility

00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:31,780
standards implemented I'll run an

00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:38,470
audition here regarding accessibility

00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:38,470
and let's see I have a severe

00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,910
accessibility

00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:47,060
problem in their web page it's saying

00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:51,140
that media controls elements should

00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:53,300
should have labels so if I click here I

00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:58,810
can go to the website and have a better

00:29:53,300 --> 00:30:02,870
explanation of that of that guideline

00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:08,300
some other warnings and the test that I

00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:12,740
passed I'll explain here it's very easy

00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:16,130
you just go to chromevox you installing

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:21,440
your browser the accessibility developer

00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:24,290
tools you you very verifies you have a

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:29,410
full report of accessibility in your web

00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:39,200
applications i'm also using here a

00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:42,470
reader let me see three this is the

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,590
chromevox reading the reading the

00:30:42,470 --> 00:31:01,190
application reading the website let me

00:30:45,590 --> 00:31:04,100
go to the new earth and then a now it

00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:06,470
take a look in this website if i want to

00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:11,330
read the germany and france proposed

00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:14,570
talks with us and spice Heather I have

00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:26,300
to go through all the elements on the

00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:50,840
page until you like it is really painful

00:31:26,300 --> 00:32:00,020
oh yeah and I want to read okay thank

00:31:50,840 --> 00:32:03,200
you very much near know yet well they

00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:06,080
could simply create a button here right

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,480
on the top where you could jump and skip

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,890
all those navigate better application

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:17,290
and go straight to the content so those

00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:20,120
are two tools that I consider very

00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:23,600
valuable when developing accessible

00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:29,360
applications and there are free and open

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:32,450
source / / all of you and that

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:37,510
accessibility tasks that Iran Eddie

00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:40,550
Eddie it considers labels and all

00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:44,060
alternative content and it checks if

00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:49,100
there is images and forms fields labeled

00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:53,720
a key keyboard accessibility a focusable

00:32:49,100 --> 00:33:00,530
UI controls if everything can be full

00:32:53,720 --> 00:33:08,300
can have focus set and area the the

00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:11,240
guideline that WT 3c sets and it

00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:13,700
validates area roles if you add area to

00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:18,190
able to your application it will verify

00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:21,830
if it's if it's correct low vision

00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:24,800
accessibility in this category it will

00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:29,840
check if the foreground the background

00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:32,890
contrast radio it is enough for four

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:37,040
people with difficulties for color

00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:39,910
regarding color perception and video

00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:43,640
accessibility if there is captions and

00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:48,080
it's there is a fall back for that video

00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:50,360
if the user doesn't doesn't have the the

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:55,580
plug-in for running that video if there

00:33:50,360 --> 00:34:00,380
is another content for that video so

00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:05,450
color testing here on this side we have

00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:10,600
the rainbow colors and then we have the

00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:15,860
way that people with different visual

00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:20,740
impairments visual disease see it so all

00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:24,830
on the second one here as you can see

00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:29,870
red and green they are really similar as

00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:33,950
the way they as the way people with

00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:36,710
their daughter and Nokia sees it so you

00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:39,530
have to win design you have to be

00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:44,450
considering that may be the color is

00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:49,430
selected we'll be seeing this or that

00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:53,620
way by users so here I'm I'm also

00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:56,650
included one very available tool or

00:34:53,620 --> 00:35:01,760
selecting your color theme for your

00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:05,970
application so here on this website I I

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:08,520
may choose for example pink

00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:13,710
a very right thing for my application

00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:18,660
and down here it is showing that it

00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:20,700
didn't pass in passes for people with

00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:23,670
all those disabilities that i just

00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:27,530
showed so I on the other side I may

00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:34,070
select another color that may be that

00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:34,070
may meet those requirements let me

00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:47,910
better open the website again Wow yeah

00:35:43,560 --> 00:36:02,520
and I have a better showcase here so if

00:35:47,910 --> 00:36:06,210
for example if I have let me see let's

00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:10,589
go simple black and white we meet all

00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:12,540
the requirements but that that's other

00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:16,320
that's not the point we want to make our

00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:19,680
website beautiful with different colors

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,960
do we want to we want to use colors so

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,540
you may play around and check what is

00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:33,990
the bad what suits better you're your

00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:37,890
website that's I mean try red and some

00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:43,890
white I'm it's better but there is this

00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:46,770
you some difficulties for people with

00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:51,500
normal vision yeah maybe you're not

00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:51,500
developing for people with normal vision

00:36:53,510 --> 00:37:05,940
and so on some other accessibility

00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:09,480
testing tools for color also includes

00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:12,750
color filter address and sing Dalton ISM

00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:20,670
the last one aids especially for Mac

00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:24,480
users ah I found the second one in my

00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:27,540
perspective one of the best ones I'll

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,550
run out simple tasks here so you have a

00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:34,140
better understanding how it how it works

00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:37,710
I have here a picture of my design

00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:40,260
design of one application that I develop

00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:47,190
and then here I have some of the

00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:50,520
disability profiles that I showed so

00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:57,170
I'll simulate a color blindness for

00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:57,170
those and it will yes so

00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:05,770
difficult for for you to see the

00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:11,750
difference maybe I mean like my Reds

00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:17,830
they are more like a brown or green

00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:20,890
brown so i may i may use this tool for

00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:25,720
checking if there is enough contrast

00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:31,100
among the elements or if it's okay for

00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:38,050
if it includes more perspectives for the

00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:49,190
application giving like more variety of

00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:54,020
colors and there is for all all the way

00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:59,960
of the accessibility guidelines who's

00:38:54,020 --> 00:39:03,590
that check if your website has if it a

00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:06,170
club accomplishes all the other the

00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:10,869
guidelines that I that I spoke that I

00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:15,320
said a checker it is a tool developed by

00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:19,940
University of Toronto it is now is

00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:23,180
supported by OCAD and it emits the

00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:26,050
requirements for it checks if if your

00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:28,670
application meets the requirements for

00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:32,270
WCAG the web content accessibility

00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:36,130
guideline the section 508 from the US

00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:41,180
and some other guidelines that I I

00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:46,460
didn't I didn't go didn't explain deeply

00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:50,410
but also out there and wave for me it's

00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:58,040
it's the one that I mostly use it's very

00:39:50,410 --> 00:40:02,359
robust Amit's w c a g and section 508

00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:05,540
and w3 see also gives you a list of

00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:09,220
tools that you can be validating our

00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:12,740
your application regarding accessibility

00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:15,230
so the i guess the slides will be able

00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:20,810
online so you can go through all these

00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:26,119
websites some standards compliant markup

00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:30,140
and for markup and CSS basically you may

00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:33,320
think one way of developing web web apps

00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:36,770
that are accessible is to have basic

00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:40,840
HTML simple layout forms based

00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:44,330
interaction and no JavaScript but that's

00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:48,530
that's one way there is a better way

00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:52,000
which is using clean HTML and standards

00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:56,390
tags whenever possible managing focus

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,880
adding key handlers so I'm the new york

00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:02,330
time application that we saw if you just

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,270
give the user an option on the keyboard

00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:10,000
to go to the main kaun content like f5

00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:13,610
or i don't know other shortcuts and

00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,840
adding area for screen readers with that

00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:21,970
you have a better better web application

00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,970
that meets accessibility requirements

00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:29,869
using clean HTML and using using

00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:33,200
standards standard tags whenever

00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:39,109
possible if you can use instead of a

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:44,810
divorce pan ah the appropriate tag in

00:41:39,109 --> 00:41:46,760
HTML such as a furling or but the tag

00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:49,940
but instead of creating a div four

00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:56,390
button that is that makes your

00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:58,520
application one step ahead native html5

00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:01,280
links and controls they are accessible

00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,619
by default and the browsers they are

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:07,990
trying to accomplish all those

00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:13,510
guidelines in their implementation so

00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:19,760
stick to the basic go with the known

00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:23,080
HTML tags when developing so label image

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:26,630
in form controls if you have an image

00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:30,190
still add that

00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:34,630
airing on a LT the alternative

00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:38,390
description for for the image label are

00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:40,640
elements in your forms so if you have a

00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:43,880
first name add a little description for

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:50,650
the first for the field that you just

00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:54,710
wrote added add a label for that input

00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:59,390
you CSS for your layout CSS is a good

00:42:54,710 --> 00:43:05,660
tool for accessibility it provides it

00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:11,539
provides organization it gives a give

00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:13,250
some some additional elements like it

00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:18,880
gives it gives you the possibility of

00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:25,430
adding a better phone for reading and

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:29,059
now we have new new tags new properties

00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:32,539
inches a three like filters such as

00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:36,069
invert brightness grayscale they are not

00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:38,809
available in all browsers yet but in a

00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:42,920
hopefully in a new feature that will be

00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:46,339
and basically you can make your entire

00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:49,880
website a little more accessible just

00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:54,109
including a simple tag like this WebKit

00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:58,549
filter invert it inverts all the colors

00:43:54,109 --> 00:44:02,779
of your web of your website and it

00:43:58,549 --> 00:44:07,849
becomes like a x-ray of your your

00:44:02,779 --> 00:44:11,420
website it may also use some of the

00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:14,839
other ones that I that I just included

00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:17,269
like brightness grayscale they are

00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:22,160
really really simple to incorporate in

00:44:17,269 --> 00:44:25,240
your app in your application and make

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:29,450
custom interactive elements focusable

00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:32,630
always I know is that it's a little bari

00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:36,259
when you're developing to add that tab

00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:40,069
index but it makes a lot of a big

00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:43,489
difference for example when we saw the

00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:46,849
New York Times application if you have a

00:44:43,489 --> 00:44:49,759
tab index for the main content as one so

00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:55,069
my second tab would be right away on the

00:44:49,759 --> 00:44:57,859
main content instead of another menu so

00:44:55,069 --> 00:45:00,890
you may have a custom tab for your

00:44:57,859 --> 00:45:03,880
elements and you can also remove some

00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:08,749
elements so they are not focusable

00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:14,630
making negative so for maybe you want to

00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:17,859
remove some some elements that are not

00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:23,180
that important for people with

00:45:17,859 --> 00:45:27,829
disability to see lines or shapes so add

00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:34,089
a tab index of with a negative number

00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:34,089
and they will not be focusable and

00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:41,930
custom controls should respond to keys

00:45:38,209 --> 00:45:46,759
like enter space so if you have a login

00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:50,150
form with a simple JavaScript function

00:45:46,759 --> 00:45:52,430
you make you make it accessible instead

00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:55,369
of forcing the user to use the mouse

00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:58,940
clicking the login button just add a

00:45:55,369 --> 00:46:08,499
simple JavaScript or an and enter and

00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:12,529
space and apply to your your element add

00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:15,729
area for screen readers as i said before

00:46:12,529 --> 00:46:20,329
area accessible rich Internet

00:46:15,729 --> 00:46:26,900
applications it is part of the html5 so

00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:28,459
it means it is supposed to be to be in a

00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:33,140
new feature implemented in all browsers

00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:35,269
available in all browsers it is a

00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:38,269
it allows you to build arbitrary custom

00:46:35,269 --> 00:46:40,609
controls and make them accessible so if

00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:47,289
you if you are designing and creating

00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:51,920
these this very not standardized

00:46:47,289 --> 00:46:57,470
checkbox you add some area controls and

00:46:51,920 --> 00:47:03,670
it will make it accessible in for screen

00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:03,670
readers or other accessibility testing

00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:11,210
tools area provides semantic information

00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:14,000
to screen readers that is normally

00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:19,819
conveyed visually as I said if you have

00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,680
if you just if you just make a draw of a

00:47:19,819 --> 00:47:24,980
bow and you want to make it a radio

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:29,329
button so use area for making it

00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:32,690
accessible three screen readers so

00:47:29,329 --> 00:47:37,430
here's some some examples of area being

00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:41,779
applied I created here a div for a

00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:47,900
bottom send button and then I simply say

00:47:41,779 --> 00:47:50,990
roll this is a button so the this Dupuis

00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:53,259
works as a button and will be read by

00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:58,990
the screen reader as a button as a

00:47:53,259 --> 00:48:02,690
native component in the browser or here

00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:06,769
this little out this other element that

00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:09,619
I that I created as a div it's now a

00:48:06,769 --> 00:48:12,440
checkbox just saying that the role is

00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:16,069
checkbox and I can also say all this

00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:18,289
checkbox it is checked for the screen

00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:21,349
reader so when the screen reader goes

00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:24,859
through this div it will reach to the

00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:28,519
user that is a check box and it this

00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:31,430
checkbox is checked so you don't really

00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:35,599
need to use the native component you can

00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:40,839
create your own on your own with adding

00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,839
simply adding attributes and properties

00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:46,510
screen readers they are prepared to know

00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:50,260
if something's changing your app

00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:54,820
so if you have a loading or saving

00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:58,360
element in your page adding area live

00:48:54,820 --> 00:49:00,630
regions attributes you you are explained

00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:04,120
to the browser something is happening

00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:08,020
even though it is a custom component

00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:12,430
that it created so here we have area

00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:17,050
life oh I for saving so the screen

00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:20,620
reader we read that there is a loading

00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:23,620
process happening for example and there

00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:27,460
are some other default live events such

00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:31,360
as an alert when an alert pops on the

00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:35,770
screen and it's you designing it in

00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:39,370
using a div just using the role area it

00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:48,250
will mean it will be read by the screen

00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:49,990
reader as a live content and finally

00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:54,160
I'll show you some of the successful

00:49:49,990 --> 00:50:01,630
projects that I that I said they are not

00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:05,740
so successful but so let me get the your

00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:09,880
rounds I selected the Canadian

00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:13,450
government web page so if i go here and

00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:16,270
I just stab you press the tab key you

00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:19,060
see right on the top there is a skip to

00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:21,910
main content that's one of the

00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:24,400
accessible requirements so if I would

00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:26,320
press ENTER it would go straight to the

00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:32,450
main content which is in this web page

00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:39,800
is just the carousel here by

00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:43,940
let me load it again and if I go through

00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:47,480
the menu it expands and allows me to use

00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:50,630
the arrow keys should go through the

00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:53,300
elements and it's reading and if I have

00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:59,440
a screen reader it will be reading which

00:50:53,300 --> 00:51:04,720
is which is fantastic for a a menu

00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:10,359
application with menus too and let me go

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:15,349
to the American government it also has I

00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:19,160
even bigger the options for skipping to

00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:27,520
the main content and a reads all the

00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:32,900
elements on the page that seems a little

00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:34,730
a like if you open if you open this up

00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:39,190
at this application with streamreader

00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:39,190
let me see if it's still running here oh

00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:46,130
but but it would read and it's not

00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:49,520
always that the screen reader that we

00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:54,589
read you have to add those area elements

00:51:49,520 --> 00:52:03,640
or use native controls to have those

00:51:54,589 --> 00:52:03,640
features and finally I

00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:10,990
elected this website exercise it shows a

00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,480
variety of successful projects and

00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:18,750
explains a little bit of why that

00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:22,210
project it has some accessibility

00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:32,350
features that deserves the consideration

00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:34,480
of your access I'm go to see it it comes

00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:37,000
with it usually with an article

00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,130
explaining what is the benefit of what

00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,510
is interesting this website regarding

00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:46,210
accessibility exercise it's really

00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:52,080
inspiring if you if you check some of

00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:54,790
these websites so you may have some

00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:57,580
interesting ideas for your applications

00:52:54,790 --> 00:53:01,360
some of the some let's go to the final

00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:03,610
thoughts recapping formulating

00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:07,360
accessibly oriented paradigm for

00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:10,300
designing you I basically it's simple

00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,820
guideline that I that we can come up

00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:17,260
with after this presentation so

00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:20,250
basically when trading your when when

00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:23,470
you're going to build an application

00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:26,560
define the target platform in audience

00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:30,430
it as I said it's impossible to have an

00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:34,990
application fully accessible so decide

00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:37,300
ah for whom will be developing this

00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:38,530
application who's your audience what is

00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:42,160
the platform that you're going to be

00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:44,290
that's your first step and then design

00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,360
the UI outlines considering

00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:53,350
accessibility testing and validation

00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:57,100
results so go for go to any I'll touring

00:53:53,350 --> 00:54:01,300
to like let's say Photoshop outline

00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:05,200
create your design and then check check

00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:08,010
if the color it's it has all the

00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:12,610
contrast that would meet the

00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:15,820
accessibility testing tools then then

00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:17,000
you transform that you I that visual you

00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:22,010
I plan

00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:24,740
to code so first you designed a combo

00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:28,220
box that looks this way then you check

00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:31,610
if it it has contrast if the color

00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:36,370
perception it's okay then you transform

00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:41,870
it into code and make it like pure HTML

00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:44,170
/ saying ncess and then finally develop

00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:46,790
using standards-compliant technology

00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:49,250
continually as securing accessibility

00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:53,530
focus progressive enhancement that means

00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:56,930
you go through your application always

00:54:53,530 --> 00:55:00,140
revising that those guidelines checking

00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:02,180
if there is tabindex if you forgot any

00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:04,790
element in your web application that is

00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:07,610
not following the the sequence of your

00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:11,110
menu so let's say oh now I added this

00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:16,220
this new menu but the tabindex it is now

00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:19,280
15 23 so you may reveal your web

00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:21,310
application and go one two three and so

00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,310
on

00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:32,740
not have to mean static slow and simple

00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:36,849
you may accomplish some great applicable

00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:41,170
applications following guidelines

00:55:36,849 --> 00:55:44,900
experiencing different different ways of

00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:46,690
development with just a bit of more work

00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:49,910
it's possible to deliver dynamic

00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:53,809
accessible experience and visually

00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:56,089
appealing UI and the first step does not

00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:58,430
require any special to work or expertise

00:55:56,089 --> 00:56:01,010
try for example just unplug your mouse

00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:03,339
and see how how you can use our

00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:07,220
application or turn off the monitor and

00:56:03,339 --> 00:56:09,109
see what you what is ah what is

00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:13,130
available in your web app in your

00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:15,799
application for the user in the end it

00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:22,160
started experimenting other alternatives

00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:25,839
for for interactivity and now open for

00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:30,460
Q&A is if you have questions up I'll be

00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:30,460
really glad of answering them

00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:48,610
okay some of the approach it is to give

00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:51,580
more than one options of interaction so

00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:53,980
you may use the voice your voice if you

00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:56,080
have an application you you you have

00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:58,800
problems modicum of motor control

00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:02,500
problems you may make your application

00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:05,590
accessible through speech giving

00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:10,740
commands voice commands for your

00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:16,170
applications like access www google com

00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:29,920
instead of typing giving another another

00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:32,550
option for the user one of the well yes

00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:38,190
accessibility as I said it is arranged

00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:41,670
some some some of the problems we can

00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:46,420
use roundabout solutions or the

00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:51,210
different solutions but there is no no

00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:53,380
it's not it's not

00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:58,060
possible to develop something fully

00:57:53,380 --> 00:58:12,160
accessible for everyone some other

00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:13,930
questions yes firefox also has I forgot

00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,540
the name right now but if you go to the

00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:19,690
add ones and look for accessible tools

00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:25,530
it has the same features as Google a

00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:28,930
screen reader and also na added a

00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:31,330
feature for out of your web your web

00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:34,420
application it's very well developed I

00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:37,390
also use one of the tools but i forgot i

00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:47,770
ate something accessible to it's simple

00:58:37,390 --> 00:59:05,310
it is any other question oh thanks for

00:58:47,770 --> 00:59:08,020
your attention work period for the

00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:12,570
science Without Borders has been

00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:15,670
extended so let's get that up thank you

00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:18,670
half up sauce 2013 we're pleased to give

00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:20,950
you this gift in and we'll have the next

00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:22,750
presentation here at eleven that might

00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:25,900
give you some time to just take a quick

00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:27,610
break will resume back to your at eleven
