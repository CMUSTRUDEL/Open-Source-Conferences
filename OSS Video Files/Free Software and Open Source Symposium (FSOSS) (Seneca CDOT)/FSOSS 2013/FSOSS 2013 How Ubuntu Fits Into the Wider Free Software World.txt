here let's don't you think you can buy

00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:13,079
like a presentation mode for this even

00:00:36,770 --> 00:01:06,600
yeah cool whatever yes it's ready

00:00:55,019 --> 00:01:11,190
Daughtery raining be a el le w yeah

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:14,960
target yeah I'd like to introduce

00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:17,970
Phillip that one here he's from

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,950
California to California mobile three

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:25,080
coordinator is gonna talk to us today

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:28,020
about how 12 is really coming to light

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:34,770
goings of users use every day i'm going

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:36,090
to talk less how so without further ado

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:43,110
I'd like they have over to fill it

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:45,270
alright thanks as he said I'm Phillip

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,979
and discussing some of the newer things

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,490
that a bun to is doing and how that is

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:54,380
allowing more and more users to get a

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,290
feel for Ubuntu and free software now

00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,600
again who am i I'm in a bunch of member

00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:03,360
what that means is I have been certified

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,640
by both ubuntu and canonical for just

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,700
continued sustained and great

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,769
contributions to a bunt too I'm the head

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,810
of the California loco though I do

00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:14,579
believe that out the local we are crazy

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:19,110
that is not what loco means in this

00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:22,709
situation we in a sense than for local

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,709
community so in the States every single

00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,690
state divided into local community verse

00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:34,620
in other countries such as Canada there

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:37,440
is a Canada community mm-hmm now where

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,080
am i from i'm from california and i am

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,940
from the San Diego the city of San Diego

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,900
the one right there that says San Diego

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,739
that's where I reside

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:50,769
now here's a picture of the city witches

00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,780
I obviously did not take that however

00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:57,480
Google Images provides great resources

00:02:52,780 --> 00:03:00,159
for people and where is that so we got

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,840
down there and now we're up here just a

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,790
short plane ride over neuro that big of

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:09,609
an issue now let's move on to some

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,280
Ubuntu basics now how many of you are

00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:14,349
familiar with the ax bunt to software

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,930
system yourself how many who have ever

00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:20,980
used it either for personal use or for

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,870
business beautiful thank you now

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:28,150
obviously it's a version of Linux based

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:30,939
on debian so though not all a bunch of

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:36,220
users realize it every single a bunt to

00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:38,769
user is inherently a Debian user founded

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:42,639
by Mark Shuttleworth I'm initial release

00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:45,370
was in 2004 titled project no name

00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:50,109
before they came up with the word a bun

00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:52,540
two or and wellness I came up decided to

00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:54,459
use that word if you will releases every

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,590
six month with long-term support release

00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,199
every two years the next long-term

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,379
support will be in April our most recent

00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:05,019
release was just a little over a week

00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:06,549
ago and it is an open community driven

00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:09,010
development with core funding from

00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:12,250
canonical meaning there are paid there

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:15,790
are people paid very good salaries to

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:18,000
develop on the bun to some mainly paid

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:22,240
through profits from canonical and

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,979
profits from people certain someone in

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,510
canonical you may or may not have a very

00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:28,539
large sum of money going to distribute

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:31,210
and there's an estimated users of 20

00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:34,870
million as you can see it could be it is

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:36,909
growing higher with the number of with a

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,630
number of desktop users as well as the

00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:44,909
number of people now using the server

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:47,500
whether interacting with it on AWS or

00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:52,090
various other cloud environments or

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:56,420
people choose a bunch you as the default

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:59,780
source for cloud and solutions

00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,850
now what does a bunch of mean a bunch of

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,400
technically means humanity towards

00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:08,060
others I am what I am because of what we

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,510
are originally an earlier distribution

00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:15,170
we included a video of Nelson Mandela

00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:17,360
discussing what the philosophy of ubuntu

00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,510
consisted of which basically translates

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,910
so that however I personally think that

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:25,130
what about you means is an ancient

00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:32,750
African word for people who cannot

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:35,180
configure their debian Wi-Fi now if some

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,920
a bunch of history here you can if you

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,400
can see that how are you familiar with

00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,800
OMG abun to it's one of the greater news

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,900
sources for ubuntu friend of mine Joey

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,690
runs it there's a special type of graph

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,830
not sure of the scientific name for it

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:57,230
not a scientist and not dr. Phil

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:59,390
unfortunately who put that up there you

00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,650
can see the relief I can shoot you a

00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,450
link to this if you ever want to print

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,970
it out for your own use or look at it

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,710
what shows everything from the first

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,860
release can you guys see the names on

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,110
there yeah up close you can come and

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,520
look at it afterwards not a big issue

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,490
borrow my laptop for hours if you really

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,830
need it shows the releases all the way

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,170
up to 14 0 for coming out in October

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,710
which we just released which we just

00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:27,530
released the name of press the tarp

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,850
horribly in Simon has it I'm sure we'll

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,320
get the provisional pronunciation

00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,320
whenever I talk to mark again one day

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,040
now if you look back at the history of

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:40,340
some of the dishes we've just looked at

00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,090
we see a bun 24 point 10 doing of you

00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,090
guys remember when this came out

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:53,810
remember yourselves when you saw this

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:56,660
coming mm-hmm now obviously as you can

00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,370
tell it's missing some of the features

00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,650
you might have even seen on some of the

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:03,710
more recent known two point three point

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:06,140
eight distributions such as there's no a

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:09,050
bunt to logo up there just the gnome

00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,729
foot logo for instance

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,909
transfer a little little future little

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:17,879
down the road to our second LTS release

00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:20,849
which are still being supported until

00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,229
fairly recent on the server for some

00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:25,169
server distribution but the ultimate

00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:26,819
stability will run older versions as

00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:31,080
well so we can see the live environment

00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:33,569
there um I remember back then when you

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,219
know brown so I would always like to say

00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:40,050
with a bunch of what can Brown do for

00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:43,379
you like with ups there Joe's a good

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:47,399
thing too now then we jump up to a bunch

00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:49,519
of 10 point 0 for still in wide use

00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:52,860
today especially on the server market

00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:56,369
now some people some people that would

00:07:52,860 --> 00:08:00,809
still say this was the greatest ubuntu

00:07:56,369 --> 00:08:04,860
desktop ever for reasons I will explain

00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:08,159
later what you're interesting now we

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,319
jump to 11 point oh four let's just go

00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:13,009
back and forth so we see that and then

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:18,749
we see that a little different correct

00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:21,089
now we open up our applications we do

00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:23,309
whatever we want to do however it's done

00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:25,110
differently and as I'm sure you all wear

00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:27,689
anything in the Linux community relating

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,360
to change is it is loved very much isn't

00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:34,560
it very much we all love change in the

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,610
lakes community yeah so that took a few

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,889
um a few months to get over if you will

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:43,019
there's the fish criticisms I think just

00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:45,420
as gnome gnome freaking out around the

00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:47,550
same time people were hesitant towards

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,589
that as well much similar to a few years

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,630
back when KDE switch some of their stuff

00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:57,810
in that caused some issues in the

00:08:51,630 --> 00:09:01,199
community however this is still the most

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:05,569
used distro and the most used desktop

00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:11,180
environment out of Linux distros today

00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:11,180
distrowatch is the district

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:31,740
well you know distrowatch does get there

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:48,690
yeah for sure mmm Google what do you

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:50,910
think is gonna win distro okay arguably

00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,440
mint does a distro of a bunch of the

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:57,810
same time if we consider ourselves with

00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:01,700
Debian distro however yeah there is that

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:04,920
speculation that mint is attempting to

00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:07,530
especially some win 11.4 came out min

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,760
saw a spike however I would argue that

00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:13,590
mint is on the decline right now

00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,060
personally however certainly something

00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:19,170
we can talk about afterwards not a big

00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:23,100
issue so then we jump up to 12 point 10

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:26,670
12 point 10 causes 12 point 10 was nice

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,380
it this is the distro that really got

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:31,980
the bugs out of unity because you when

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,900
univers least with 11.4 there were a few

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,110
bugs obviously because it wasn't an LTS

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,880
release 12.4 was the LTS release so we

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,440
got them more cleared out then and even

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,050
further down the road we put them out

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,650
even more with 12 point 10 before we

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:50,280
started throwing in very spectacular

00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:54,960
features and then we get up to 13 point

00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:59,430
0 for 13 for enough for revolution

00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:02,700
revolution at some things by um it made

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,589
the HUD very stable for use have any of

00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:08,030
you guys ever used the HUD HUD heads-up

00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:10,320
display yeah so you cap your alt key and

00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:12,600
you can just start typing whatever you

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,780
need and it pops up we've had it in

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,339
there for a few distros now and it's

00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,330
ultimately getting towards going to

00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,330
recognize what's going on

00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,530
now we get up to the one that we

00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:29,110
released this week 13 point 10 have any

00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:33,850
of you guys use their Kington yet what

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:35,850
do you guys think of it one thing that I

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,170
like about Ubuntu is in a large part

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:42,370
when it releases you don't necessarily

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:45,630
notice too much of a giant change for

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:48,310
the average user in the sense that

00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,290
that's good because your operating

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,470
system is really only noticed when

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:56,260
something wrong is going on if your

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,420
operating system is letting you know

00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,250
that it there you typically have a

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,260
problem your operating system of the pop

00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:07,780
up and say check out how good I'm doing

00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:20,710
it pops them says system error yeah of

00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:48,480
course well such as life yeah yeah mmhmm

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:52,090
yeah Oh totally yeah it is aimed at

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,860
usability over customization now I

00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:57,190
understand that customization for many

00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:00,490
people can provide greater usability yes

00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:02,410
however the type of dish the type of

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:05,290
person that this discharge targeted for

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,540
is not necessarily someone who wants to

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:10,930
do high customization we provide

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:13,210
customization tools for people to do

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,850
specific customizations whoever you are

00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:19,590
into very specific customizations I

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:25,450
would personally recommend using a

00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:27,010
flavor distro or say gnome so a bunch o

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:31,870
is in many ways a gnome distro pure

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:34,210
gnome lxde KDE xoc katie is very very

00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,590
very customizable if you guys have never

00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:48,070
tried coupon too or

00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:51,810
Gabi and Katie for the shot I see what

00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:58,060
you're saying um yes we're shooting for

00:13:51,810 --> 00:14:02,020
the ability to install ubuntu as you see

00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:05,290
here on yes yes on multiple form factors

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,150
I'll discuss later how we have a word

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,520
we're using called convergence to where

00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:13,420
we are converging all form factors to be

00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:23,680
able to use the same a bun to throughout

00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:25,120
your system yes we're making well we're

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,860
making great inroads into the server

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,290
market with some of the platforms that

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:32,140
we releasing and believe like I said the

00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:36,310
beginning we are at least as of a couple

00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:40,330
weeks ago the top installed linux distro

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:46,050
for AWS Rackspace uses us for some

00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:46,050
things there's no yeah

00:14:52,980 --> 00:15:01,440
a lot of canonical's profitability comes

00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:04,170
from the server market mm-hmm to have

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,589
something such as landscape which

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:09,779
manages your a bunch of server for you

00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:12,839
that cost a fair amount of money and

00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:14,339
it's not something intended for me to a

00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,990
I'm going to run a little little

00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:19,649
wordpress blog here I'm not going to go

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:23,370
and pay canonical to do that I've got

00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:26,339
that before giant University giant

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:29,850
corporation to get a sysadmin in a box

00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:33,060
essentially which is very good for

00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:35,940
specific cases because there are some

00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,680
people who would prefer to completely

00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,660
build limit from scratch however that is

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,940
not what a bunch of servers aimed at a

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:46,500
bunch of servers aimed at making the

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,910
linux server for people who are not

00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,990
someone you would typically see running

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:54,300
a linux server mm-hmm because we're

00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,100
we're linux fundamentally linux

00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,709
fundamentally assumes you know what

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,380
you're doing but i would generally say

00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:03,329
that is the fund when a when a bash when

00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,329
a bash script completes completes it

00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:08,699
doesn't say script complete it just goes

00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:10,980
to the next line of bosch linux

00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:13,620
fundamentally seems okay we're done here

00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:18,209
ubuntu attempts to take some of that

00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:24,569
away and in its place put usability for

00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:28,290
people who might not be used to that so

00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:32,490
another thing that is new in 1310 is

00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:37,370
smart scopes it's the ability for you to

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:40,740
search web information from the unity

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:45,079
dash as well this received some

00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:48,209
criticism back about a year ago from

00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:51,569
people who thought that we were holding

00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:53,610
information of people and tracking them

00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:55,949
now essentially we provide the option

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,380
for people to manually uninstall this if

00:16:55,949 --> 00:17:01,260
they are not satisfied with it however

00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:03,899
the majority of people that we've user

00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,309
tested and work with are quite satisfied

00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:07,579
with this so we are continuing to push

00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:07,579
it up

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:13,270
mark sure was actually bought years ago

00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,850
or a few months ago and has specifically

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,190
addressed this issue to where canonical

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:22,780
has never given anything to any

00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:25,150
government source unless brought to with

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,920
a warrant and that has happened on in

00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:31,210
compound a single hand with the number

00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:34,680
of time yeah just like anything else

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:34,680
that goes on the wire of course for sure

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:50,550
yeah the NSA is listening to know

00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:54,850
everything these days unfortunately yeah

00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:58,780
of course mm-hmm I mean I make a phone

00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:00,640
call in the States and I guarantee

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:04,800
they'll senior I say the words Pakistan

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,510
and all of a sudden something pops up

00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,380
now let's talk about some of the default

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:13,600
applications that are included firefox

00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:17,680
rhythmbox and libreoffice obviously now

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,930
firefox has been contested several times

00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:23,850
in the ability and people wanting to

00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:28,600
switch from mozilla firefox to chromium

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:29,860
however every single release would

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,580
probably have about three or four weeks

00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:36,700
of heated mailing lists not osita to say

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,170
like the linux kernel mailing list if

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,750
you guys ever subscribe to that you are

00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,350
insane however there's been some

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:46,570
contention lately however this distro

00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:52,300
continues and most likely will continue

00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:54,160
to be a Firefox shipping district now

00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,890
let's talk about a buncha on the mobile

00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,390
plant how many of you have ever

00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:03,990
installed a bunch you on any of your

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,990
cell phone and if you go

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:13,880
there's been an sdk testing image you

00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:16,490
can put on for a while mm-hmm the SDK

00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,730
officially got released not long ago yes

00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:22,550
and that will be great for device

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:25,429
manufacturers and phone producers to

00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:29,780
look at are you any of you familiar with

00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:37,280
the IndieGoGo campaign we did this

00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:40,059
summer yes mm-hmm now essentially the

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:45,220
goal was to raise 32 million dollars in

00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:48,440
some sense in many ways the goal however

00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:52,030
was to portray to device manufacturers

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:56,030
this is the number of people that are

00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:58,220
very interested seven hundred dollars

00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:02,390
screams a little more than interested

00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:05,690
even to me screams wanting or as soon as

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:08,300
they possibly can to get a phone of that

00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:10,700
capability with unlock software on it

00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:14,090
and so what that said to the Vice

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,910
manufacturers was look here's people who

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,740
are willing to pay this amount of money

00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:23,300
watch in return yield this amount of

00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:25,580
prop for you guys obviously it's

00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,280
something that is currently going on and

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:31,130
are and the CEO of canonical Jane is her

00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:36,170
name has said that a bunch of phones

00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:39,800
will be available in 2014 she has been

00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:41,179
quoted on that several times this is

00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,929
where we're pushing the idea of

00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:48,050
convergence which is one platform one on

00:20:44,929 --> 00:21:09,340
one device for all 11 platform for all

00:20:48,050 --> 00:21:09,340
devices okay sure whatever yes

00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:33,660
well we're not just targeting North

00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:39,210
American phone manufacturers or systems

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:44,670
as well yeah yes because where they have

00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:49,710
made less inroads in non white Western

00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:53,550
nations to and we're marketing lower in

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,870
phones as well as higher in phones aside

00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:57,270
from the a bunch of edge based

00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:59,460
specifications of a phone we're also

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:02,400
working on slightly lower in phones to

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:06,150
market to other areas of the world as

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:11,160
well to we also have a group called the

00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:15,090
Abu Abu to carrier advisory group where

00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:19,560
phone companies such as Verizon and the

00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:23,810
States has joined to showcase a group

00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:27,680
getting together to work on phones

00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:30,750
getting this device out there for them

00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:59,670
so there are carriers who are interested

00:22:30,750 --> 00:23:02,960
in carrying it yeah yeah it's it's not

00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:06,570
an easy journey exactly it's not at all

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,900
yeah Oh believe me I'm not I'm not gonna

00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,280
sit here and just the SU and say we're

00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,960
gonna make tons of money off because

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,660
that that's not going to happen and

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,810
that's not going to happen easily at all

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,810
good work

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:24,150
we are making apps specifically for the

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:26,680
phone we are encouraging people the same

00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:33,820
it's the ability to have the same

00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:53,310
interface on all devices or that yes yes

00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:55,930
exactly yeah well they're certainly I

00:24:53,310 --> 00:25:00,490
mean we can make analogies such as that

00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:04,300
but cars aren't necessarily computers

00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:07,420
for sure because to understand that we

00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:09,940
are putting the system we are putting

00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:11,230
the system on to the physical hardware

00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,760
and the way you interact with a physical

00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,550
hardware is going to be different

00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:19,180
however it'll can it'll control the same

00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:22,360
purpose implying that we can put the

00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,590
platform onto the onto the tablet but

00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,970
that doesn't mean that because it's a

00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:28,120
desktop interface you have to have a

00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:30,430
mouse for it the way that you will use

00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,260
it would be obviously via your your

00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:34,260
hands are a pin or something

00:25:38,340 --> 00:26:03,760
and that's what we're working on the pc

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,530
as we know it is ultimately changing

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:30,750
that now desktops have been a sense

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:34,720
faded out so yes for sure for sure

00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:38,580
something may come in that replaces what

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:43,740
the mouse does for a different device

00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:43,740
however only time can tell in many ways

00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:17,260
i would say that at a linux conference

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:23,679
you're more likely to have people on

00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:26,559
something powerful compared to ya to

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,780
where the average go down to starbucks

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,340
down the road and the person there who

00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:36,299
wants to check their gmail account in

00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:36,299
the facebook account that's what they

00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:21,320
most people would prefer a bar on the

00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:22,850
side that opens up the only three

00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:46,159
applications they ever really use in

00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:49,010
their life I will inform you once again

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:51,140
that unity is open source the code is

00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:53,710
open you're willing to fork it if you

00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:57,250
want to spend a few weeks at it you know

00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:57,250
I'm not stopping

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:56,300
when X is currently went on every single

00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:59,120
platform besides the desktop it's it's

00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:10,970
winning them a car market to its winning

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:14,120
in your appliance market good point all

00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:17,450
right next slide all right so near have

00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:20,540
any of you guys ever heard of mere yes

00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,950
it is um well it is one of the ways in

00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:25,550
which we are facilitating our

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:27,320
conversions idea it is open source do

00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:32,120
they would test I threw up a screenshot

00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:36,740
of the launchpad codebase there you're

00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:41,860
welcome to browse yourself ever it is a

00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:44,000
bit it is not included on the current

00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,920
recent release distro however you are

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,470
more than welcome to install it play

00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:51,860
with it test it see what you think even

00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:55,550
provide some bugs one which there

00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:57,970
certainly is a few still there was

00:30:55,550 --> 00:31:08,620
obviously some criticism because we

00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:08,620
chose not to use Wayland however the

00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:19,160
better the reason that we chose near was

00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:22,010
not necessarily because Waylon couldn't

00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:26,830
do it but because Waylon does more than

00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:30,860
we want it to do in the sense that we

00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:31,820
want near to be simplified to be able to

00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:38,020
simply control

00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:40,550
converging platform obviously X needs to

00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:45,290
sooner or later x will no matter what

00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:48,740
takes it over phase out whether it is

00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:50,300
mirror whether it is way land on water

00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:54,050
district leather or something else it's

00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:59,810
certainly it could be an interesting

00:31:54,050 --> 00:32:02,450
Road in two or three years now let's

00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:04,100
talk about the a bunch of community and

00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,930
how you can possibly get involved with

00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:10,540
ubuntu yourself to help contribute to

00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:15,350
free software have any of you guys ever

00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:16,880
created a launchpad account one thing

00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,130
you can find on there the code of

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,790
conduct which is how to participate in

00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:25,100
the about youth community effective it's

00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:29,030
how we play nice with each other if you

00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:32,750
will just highlight some basic things

00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:36,950
there it is don't harass based on any

00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:40,850
type of color sec orientation gender

00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:42,770
identification don't don't be an

00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:55,100
I don't know if I allowed to say that

00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:56,900
here but essentially I supposed to say I

00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:03,800
supposed to flip off and Vidya now or

00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:05,180
something or well there is that by this

00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,130
are you going on we'll see what happened

00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,720
there that just that doesn't mean the

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,890
drivers won't be written that just means

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,650
the little cottage mark shuttleworth

00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:14,000
yeah mark shuttleworth will have to take

00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:17,780
a few left plane trips around the world

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,610
apparently never been on the one yet but

00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:28,040
we'll see what happens how the community

00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:31,760
works now let's do a general overview of

00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:34,060
this so one of the main places for about

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,460
two community contributors development

00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:41,450
packaging bugs programming we're big

00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:44,920
into Python right now and go go is

00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,920
another interesting platform and

00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:56,810
c++ or as I near is here C++ mm-hm could

00:33:54,620 --> 00:34:02,060
bc i'm not entirely sure on that one and

00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:05,300
then one of the biggest things we look

00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:08,960
for is packaging these days a bunch of

00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:12,680
community we do a lot of packaging this

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,090
is taken at a ubuntu developer summit we

00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:20,960
use that physical bunch of developer

00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:22,670
summits in one of the europe if you're a

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,840
Lando they've had them all over the

00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:28,700
places documentation we all know

00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:36,080
programmers love writing documentation

00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:37,730
correct so obviously if some programmers

00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,940
do not like writing documentation

00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:43,430
documentation written by said programmer

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:48,650
might not be as good as someone written

00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:50,540
by a technical writer or person who

00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,950
enjoys writing documentation I'm not

00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,600
entirely sure what that is wrong with

00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,950
that person that makes them enjoy

00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,390
writing documentation I'm by

00:34:54,950 --> 00:35:01,850
the way however there is many people who

00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:03,170
contribute Chuck made documentation for

00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,760
a bunkie was actually looking for more

00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,340
community members to help out the dot

00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:11,360
team so then you guys want to get

00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:12,830
started with that google it or come talk

00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:18,920
to me and i can show you some lynch some

00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:24,680
people to talk to support a bunch of

00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:28,100
needs quality people supporting whereas

00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,430
devon to developers a buncha

00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:34,810
documentation writers can all employees

00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:39,050
may not necessarily have time to support

00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:42,260
newer users or other users coming from

00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:44,810
other distros we need people to help

00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:47,150
people get on get started get their feet

00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,520
wet with a buncha even get their feet

00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,440
wet with linux i often thinks that

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,170
ubuntu is in many ways a gateway drug to

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,349
linux in some ways true you have some

00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:59,690
people start off with ubuntu and then

00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:02,239
move to a different distro later down

00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:03,559
the road a Bunter used to be tagged men

00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:07,999
with their motto is Linux for human

00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:10,190
beings until we decided that Linux of a

00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:14,059
scary word don't use the l word it'll

00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:15,259
scare people away and we do not use the

00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:19,099
word when it's our website anymore

00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:21,099
necessarily obviously the feel good is

00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:26,109
good you get that warm feeling inside

00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:34,369
you know that's calling a few guys but

00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:37,249
helping others is always nice one of the

00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:39,559
main areas for support is going to be

00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:41,470
the bunch of forms or a scale up to have

00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:48,410
any of you guys ever used you the one

00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:50,119
which ones you use the forms is I would

00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,099
argue to ask 12 is much better than the

00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:55,759
forms because it's a stack exchange

00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:58,009
platform simply because it is easier to

00:36:55,759 --> 00:37:00,890
find the answer you want without

00:36:58,009 --> 00:37:05,710
scrolling through forms are certainly

00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:11,359
good if that's your mentality however

00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:13,910
ask a bunch ooh there is more recent

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:17,619
prominent answers to of unto specific

00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:21,440
problems on there compared to the forms

00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:24,619
the forms there's more users on the

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,900
forums however you're more prominent a

00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:30,440
bunch of community members and canonical

00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:33,079
members are going to be on the forum

00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:37,880
some canonical or even a bunch of main

00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:40,160
development channels will our IRC will

00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,289
get tagged when a question gets put on

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,359
after 12 and the paid canonical

00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:46,519
developers have to go and answer that

00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:56,259
question because the 30 and pay to make

00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:59,359
the software I suppose yeah for sure yes

00:37:56,259 --> 00:38:01,749
it is mm-hmm there's a new website we're

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,219
setting up called a bunch of discourse

00:38:01,749 --> 00:38:07,729
which is almost a discussion hangout

00:38:04,219 --> 00:38:09,650
type place for whether it be a bunch of

00:38:07,729 --> 00:38:10,940
new murder people looking for help it's

00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:15,560
almost a

00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:17,359
forum page without its forms without

00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,849
what people consider do the problems are

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,220
formed you can also reply to the form

00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:31,940
via email with this nice nice feature

00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:32,810
not every form does that not entirely

00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:45,560
sure about that I haven't tried it

00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:47,869
myself but certainly sure that yeah yes

00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,089
it is mm-hmm that wouldn't surprise me I

00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:52,280
mean something that is being used by

00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:54,880
Linux users I'm sure there's somebody

00:38:52,280 --> 00:39:16,550
grew up some script somewhere obviously

00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:19,010
come on laughing yeah yeah turtle we do

00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:26,599
the installer when you're installing it

00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:28,640
will mention it when you install the guy

00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:31,450
you run the Installer he lives out of

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,040
Vancouver who makes the Installer

00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,300
slideshow puts it on the slide show

00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:39,500
where it says you can go and visit

00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:43,310
Ascalon to for help when you are so I

00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:45,109
believe there's a help option and when

00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:47,089
you go to the dash and type help it was

00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:52,310
there a district your version or two ago

00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:55,730
and I looked at it however it is not

00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:59,210
readily available on the desktop such as

00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:01,520
it used to be a gnome 2.8 you had i

00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:05,329
think it was up the top three main

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:09,530
button for firefox and like a file

00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:12,369
browser and help that is gone yes but

00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:12,369
it's not as readily available

00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:35,970
I think that a bunch you on a personal

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:39,390
note I think that a bunt you should

00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:41,369
after a day or so if using come up and

00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:44,760
say how is this working is there

00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:46,260
anything we can assist you with and if

00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,990
they would click yes it's working just

00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,940
great okay it goes away no it's not and

00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:52,619
a fool comes up and says what can we

00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:57,450
help you with and it points you toward

00:40:52,619 --> 00:41:15,180
or get it where to get it that's just my

00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:19,890
personal we don't want to avoid IRC for

00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:23,369
new users though if I if my grandmother

00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:29,010
received an rtfm from somebody I would

00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:31,319
be kind of annoyed even though the code

00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:33,780
of conduct applies on IRC channels and

00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:37,319
will probably kick them out if they do

00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,849
that repeatedly we actually several

00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:40,200
years ago removed some of the monthly

00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:45,089
membership because they were harassing

00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:47,390
people on IRC channels in a bun to con

00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:54,030
people idiot and stuff like that and

00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:56,760
Ubuntu can be the distro for new linux

00:41:54,030 --> 00:42:05,990
users who do not want to increase their

00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:14,460
knowledge of linux in many ways what yes

00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:18,900
exactly there's yeah mmm design all

00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:20,250
right so we got the you guys remember

00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,220
how it used to be brown and now it's

00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:24,960
purple we have the color palette up here

00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:27,299
if you got you probably can't read the

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,319
colors of course there's a website where

00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:30,059
you can get a lot of the luncheon

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:33,180
materials to spread around called spread

00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:36,690
abun to calm which contains stuff like

00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,910
this you can print out and release locos

00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:41,860
will put stuff up there various

00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:47,860
interesting things such as that

00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:51,340
you can see the pictograms will go on

00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:55,180
canonical's website occasionally from

00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:58,600
the dress design process design team

00:42:55,180 --> 00:43:01,330
makes them people who actually like

00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,010
artists and make things look at

00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:09,910
something I'm probably not very good at

00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:13,660
myself alright there's one more slide

00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:16,840
here community government governance the

00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:20,200
community itself has several ways in

00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,000
order govern the entire body that make

00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:27,040
up a bunch of community members as well

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,560
as occasionally ubuntu users that is set

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,970
up with locos that are controlled by the

00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:37,480
local counsel the local council will

00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:40,570
approve and deny lokos official local

00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:43,690
community status and approved loco gets

00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:47,320
several things such as a giant-ass

00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:51,340
banner sent out from canonical for you

00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:55,720
to display around go back in sit in my

00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:58,960
home I have a ten foot by three feet

00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:09,040
banner or what that isn't whatever all

00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:12,940
right some some odd thing there and have

00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:16,660
a tablecloth and also as well as

00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:20,230
conference packs so in February I'll be

00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:24,100
working a booth in Los Angeles and I'll

00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:27,040
call up or the email London comic office

00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:28,810
and hey I'm working this again you guys

00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,150
want obviously have a bunch of shown

00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:36,640
here so mail me some stuff and I'll get

00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:39,840
lanyards tickers buttons CDs they're

00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:43,870
currently trying to phase out CDs

00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:48,190
because well CDs are somewhat phasing

00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:50,470
out how we used to have the CD program

00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:52,720
to give out free CDs to people via the

00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:54,310
mail we don't do that anymore then we

00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,660
used to ship out CDs to every single

00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:58,150
local ever release

00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:01,680
we don't do that anymore we now do it

00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:04,920
for every LTS so I have about 300 LTS

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:11,950
12.04 CDs so i'll be giving an hour in

00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:13,750
LA for months governing the head

00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:17,380
governing board is called the community

00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:18,880
council the community council is run by

00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,470
various community members as well as

00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,380
Mark Shuttleworth who sits on the board

00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:26,230
it's way it's a great way for community

00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:29,680
members to tell mark what they are

00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:34,500
interested in or mad at or mark to tell

00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:37,260
them what's going on it allows for

00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:42,069
greater community canonical feedback

00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:44,530
however community and canonical feedback

00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:48,099
is increasing or attempting to be

00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:50,920
increased as we speak the community

00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:54,819
council is currently the greatest way

00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:59,470
that we have for feedback to chronicle

00:45:54,819 --> 00:46:03,460
directly except for say blogs or angry

00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:04,990
rants on IRC which occasionally

00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:13,140
ingredients can always solve something

00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:27,880
but that allows community members to

00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:32,190
directly talk to mark yeah as a user as

00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:35,260
a community member canonical has done a

00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:36,990
fair amount of things that many people

00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:41,079
in the community can see is ostracized

00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:43,569
one thing was changing physical UDS to

00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:48,339
virtual UDS tour they're no longer

00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:50,619
flying community members out wherever

00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:54,869
they want to anywhere and now it's

00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:59,980
Google+ base I think personally that

00:46:54,869 --> 00:47:02,799
canonical is attempting with the phone

00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:06,280
to make one last effort in many ways to

00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:07,420
attempt to make a profit

00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,640
they're going to slim down to make a

00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:11,800
profit canonical it could be making a

00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:15,970
lot of money right now if they were

00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:18,160
simply a server-based company in many

00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:20,710
ways the desktop is not the desktop does

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:26,260
not make as much money as the server

00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:28,180
that's a known fact however the desktop

00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:32,490
is essential to their convergence plan

00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:32,490
and that's what we're working on today

00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:44,770
yes um there is talk about they deposit

00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:48,190
consider however mark shuttleworth

00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:52,420
fundamentally feels that a bunt you

00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:59,830
should not be charging for its operating

00:47:52,420 --> 00:48:01,870
system mm-hmm all right is there any

00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:03,010
other questions or complaints you're all

00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:07,470
going to come up to me afterwards and

00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:07,470
yell at me too but don't work

00:48:45,980 --> 00:49:08,490
yes it is very true there is much there

00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:10,920
is much hesitation and much annoyance to

00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:15,930
India buncha Committee for canonical

00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:19,260
using the word abun to it so say the

00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:21,210
Ubuntu community manager is by many

00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:26,550
peoples I seen as a canonical community

00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:45,920
manager or because a buncha is a much

00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:45,920
more well-known word Danakil yeah yeah

00:49:52,250 --> 00:50:51,359
they could fundamentally they obviously

00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:52,680
are unable to contribute as much as they

00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,359
Red Hat would because of the size

00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,790
obviously economic last several hundred

00:50:54,359 --> 00:51:01,620
employees wears red hat has thousands

00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:04,700
however canonical makes large

00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:07,200
contributions not necessarily based on

00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:09,450
the amount of code produced but the

00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,490
amount of free software they take that

00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:12,810
code amount of free software is from

00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:15,870
that code they're able to take and put

00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:18,690
into users hands in some ways they

00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:22,470
contribute upstream too many projects

00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:24,720
such as are they contribute free

00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:27,960
software which is taken up stream such

00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:30,510
as upstart juju assaf server platform

00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:33,260
eat by debian and put on debian fedora

00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:35,760
repositories they contribute to mozilla

00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:38,640
they do contribute to opens act and they

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,740
do contribute to the colonel not as much

00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:44,640
as many people would like to see of

00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:46,260
course however Microsoft for a while

00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:50,880
with the fifth largest contributor to

00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:56,100
the long journal yeah it's true and that

00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:59,610
is something that when canonical makes a

00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:01,470
greater amount of profit will most

00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:13,970
likely increase its contributed

00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:13,970
contribution yes

00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:50,619
yeah it's interesting because yeah yes

00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,420
it's almost a difference between

00:52:50,619 --> 00:52:54,789
open-source software and free software

00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:57,309
or is open source software software you

00:52:54,789 --> 00:52:59,920
can look at verse free software is

00:52:57,309 --> 00:53:01,500
software free free software is

00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,849
fundamentally about people and community

00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:08,740
without people and community you have

00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:11,619
open source software with and you do not

00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:15,519
have community where one's like it and

00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:49,869
then to where your point was on how r

00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:52,150
again yeah yes yes yes how can we brand

00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:55,569
ourselves with being a brand that both

00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:57,759
users like and open-source advocates

00:53:55,569 --> 00:54:00,160
such as yourselves in myself like yeah

00:53:57,759 --> 00:54:02,529
it and that is a struggle we're working

00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:07,829
on today how can we fit in in a

00:54:02,529 --> 00:54:10,599
corporate environment without becoming

00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:13,630
corporate and we can be hella corporate

00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:16,359
and everything however that's not going

00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:18,009
to allow us to make as many friends in

00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:20,980
the open source community and you've

00:54:18,009 --> 00:54:25,299
seen that with red hat too in many ways

00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:30,150
red hat was for a while seen as the evil

00:54:25,299 --> 00:54:35,670
empire I personally like Red Hat myself

00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:40,660
canonical is in many ways trying to

00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:44,890
bridge the gap between open source

00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:47,750
community and open source corporate

00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:49,760
because whereas other distros

00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:52,730
which have corporations have two

00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:57,230
districts have a company based distro

00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:59,240
and a community distro in a sense we do

00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:02,210
not have that's where we have a distro

00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:05,890
in what corporation Jews and community

00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:05,890
use which they are all contributing to

00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:20,020
our but that's awesome everyone here at

00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:20,020
