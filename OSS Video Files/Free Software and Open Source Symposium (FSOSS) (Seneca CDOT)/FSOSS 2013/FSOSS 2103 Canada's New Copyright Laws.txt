regarding basically Canada's copyright

00:00:52,570 --> 00:01:12,490
legislation especially as it relates

00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:28,030
recently on open source itself on to

00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:29,799
where it was on a repository thank you

00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,049

grateful you chose mine to wrap up this

00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,790
wonderful symposium I'm Adam Saunders

00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:48,159
I'm a recent law school graduate of the

00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,290
University of Ottawa I'm an articling

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,040
student at a small firm the law offices

00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,659
of Dijon Kirby in Sarnia Ontario I to

00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,320
anticipate being called to the bar in

00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:02,229
September 2014 in the limited spare time

00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,180
I have between my work preparation for

00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:07,090
licensing exams trying to be a

00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,549
semi-decent husband to my wife and ass

00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:13,029
at least a semi-decent father from our

00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:14,380
beautiful 11 week old daughter I play

00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:16,930
around with open source

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,760
I'm a member of the Fedora Linux design

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,530
team where I focus on pixel art graphic

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,630
design and reviewing the work of other

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,120
contributors to fedora related design

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:27,610
work I run both Ubuntu and Fodor on my

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,810
laptop and I have Debian in a chore

00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:34,930
route on my rooted android tablet so I'm

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,580
an enthusiast later this year I'll be

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,680
teaching myself programming I'm going to

00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,790
start a personal project to write 25

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:45,460
Java software apps in 25 weeks and on my

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,560
github account at a Saunders so just my

00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,060
first initial last name I am trying to

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,340
create new licensing tools for

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,230
dedicating works subject is so called

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,480
intellectual property laws to the public

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,920
domain based off of the excellent work

00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,230
that Creative Commons has done in the

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:04,360
space and contributions and pull

00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:05,650
requests are welcome that's me so I'm

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,780
here to talk about some of the recent

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,150
changes in Canada's copyright law I am

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,400
NOT going to take the full hour as I

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,050
imagine very few of you are interested

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,680
in sitting through an hour long legal

00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:20,020
talk after a full day of technical talks

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,110
I'll take about 30 minutes and then your

00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,210
questions before i start i unfortunately

00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,070
need to make a disclaimer that is

00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:30,130
characteristic of these types of talks

00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:32,320
this is not legal advice you should not

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,060
take or fail to take any action based

00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,610
upon the information this presentation

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,550
don't disregard any professional legal

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:43,240
advice nor delay in seeking it just

00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,470
because I said something also this talk

00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,890
doesn't establish a lawyer-client

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,390
relationship between me and any of you I

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,850
am NOT a lawyer and I'm certainly not

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:56,140
your lawyer if you think you have a

00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:57,430
legal problem find a lawyer great now

00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,590
that that's out of the way we'll get

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:04,860
started can anyone tell me what digital

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:14,920
rights or restrictions management is yes

00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:16,209
yes that's true more descriptive s right

00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,910
that's that's an excellent way to put it

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:21,400
does anyone have a basic sense of what

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:25,380
copyright is just the very fundamentals

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,380
in the back

00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:39,639
right very yeah essentially but that's

00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:41,949
basically it so copyright law is indeed

00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,840
it's a set of exclusive but transferable

00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:46,360
rights and privileges given to authors

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,770
of works of creative expression so those

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,039
kind of works could include things like

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,710
paintings music and software in both

00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,930
source code form and executable form so

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,699
in Canada copyright is statutory law

00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,039
it's not common law so that means we

00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:02,020
have a copyright act that the federal

00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:05,229
government wrote and made into binding

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:09,160
law so the government revised it in 2011

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:11,380
and it became enforced as of jun 29 2012

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,030
so that was the first time in 15 years

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,979
that we've actually had any changes to

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,289
the Copyright Act there was three times

00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:19,300
before 2011 where the federal

00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:21,010
government's have tried to make changes

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,419
but the opposition parties shot it down

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:26,229
because they weren't too thrilled with

00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:28,870
it so but now we have a new law for

00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:30,760
better and for worse so users got some

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,789
really good new provisions in the law

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:37,090
you can now legally record TV shows to

00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:38,260
watch them later as long as you destroy

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,990
the coffee soon after you're done

00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:47,740
watching it yes that was against the law

00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:50,500
until last year right right I'll get

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:53,260
into that in a bit yes that's that's

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,729
correct you can make backups of the

00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,710
copyright restricted works in your

00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:59,229
possession to protect yourself from loss

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,539
of the originals you can even put

00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:03,340
non-commercial video and music remixes

00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:05,349
up on public-facing web sites like

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,810
youtube without worrying about being

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,360
sued as long as you attribute the

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,400
original works you don't substantially

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,500
harm the ability of the author to sex

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,360
successfully exploit the original works

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,150
and you don't otherwise infringe

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,340
copyright which is a really awesome in

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,820
broad remix right there all these cat

00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,770
videos are now legal fair dealing

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,300
exceptions other things you can do with

00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:29,680
a work subject to copyright without

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,260
needing to get permission from the

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,919
copyright holder now includes parody

00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:37,270
satire in education so now the education

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,790
exception has actually had a massive

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,890
effect for colleges and

00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,030
rissa teased with regards to their

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:46,140
educational resources acquisition

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:48,310
policies but that is another talk

00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,660
unfortunately users also got a very

00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,610
nasty provision regarding

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,530
anti-circumvention of digital rights

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,750
management and technological protection

00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,880
measures for convenience sake I'll refer

00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,040
to them collectively as drm so these

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,840
measures are either software or hardware

00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,430
based and their most visible effect is

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,040
to restrict what users can do with

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:09,340
digital works like video games or music

00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,440
files that they acquire or stream on the

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,200
software side you will usually see some

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,570
form of encryption sometimes the drm to

00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,120
work will have a phoning home function

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,190
built into it requesting where it will

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,070
request authentication from a particular

00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,050
license server for playback so that

00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,090
could be either an occasional around a

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,220
one-time basis this is characteristic a

00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,200
lot of paid applications on the android

00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,760
store for example if you see on the

00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,070
permissions where to ask for a license

00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,340
check that's that's basically that DRM

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:43,600
functionality in the case of some video

00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:45,280
games like the new SimCity a constant

00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,800
internet connection to the authorization

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,970
server can be required so that is often

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,280
called always-online drm on the hardware

00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,620
side you'll find measures like special

00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,720
lockout chips on circuit boards which

00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,750
can detect and reject unauthorized media

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,730
so this is when you buy say if you go to

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,890
Japan and you buy an anime DVD and you

00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:07,780
want to watch it on your DVD player at

00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:09,610
home in Canada it doesn't work because

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,140
it's a different it's registered as a

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,030
different region and lockout

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,700
functionality in the hardware prevents

00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,080
it from being played back so what's

00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,150
particularly nasty about the

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,060
anti-circumvention provisions for users

00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,440
is that it cancels out the new and old

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,770
user rights that I mentioned earlier

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,840
when the user is facing a DRM to work so

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,790
as I'm speaking before a computer

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,040
literate and open-source friendly crowd

00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,650
I think it's safe for me to say why

00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:38,500
strengthening drm through law is awful

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:40,419
so there are two main types of anti drm

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,010
arguments you'll get the it doesn't do

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,290
what it's supposed to do argument and

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,480
the it does what it's supposed to do and

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,790
what it's supposed to do is stifle

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,910
competition and prolong monopoly an

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,200
oligopoly control of certain markets

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,590
protecting incumbents at the expense of

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,470
the nav a

00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:58,840
in startups so for the first argument

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,520
here's a quotation from eric s raymond

00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,510
one of the foundational philosophers

00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:06,100
behind open-source drm is a disaster for

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,200
everyone involved with it because it

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,660
cannot do what it claims what imposes

00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,610
large costs in the process of failing

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,680
the people who have sold drm

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,750
technologies to big media are frauds

00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,210
playing on the ignorance of media

00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,680
executives and both the media companies

00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:25,030
and the consumer have suffered greatly

00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:27,190
and unnecessarily as a result for the

00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,110
second argument the anti competition

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,450
argument here's what Ian Hicks and

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,170
Google employee and maintainer of the

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:37,360
html5 specification things the purpose

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:40,420
of DRM is not to prevent copyright

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,030
violations the purpose of DRM is to give

00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:46,150
content providers leverage against

00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,440
creators of playback devices the only

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,980
people who are stopped from doing

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,810
anything are the player providers they

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,930
are forced to provide a user experience

00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:58,840
that rather than being optimized for the

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:02,770
users puts potential future revenues

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,780
first forcing people to play ads keeping

00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,140
the door open to charging more for more

00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:09,370
features later building artificial

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,830
obsolescence into content so that after

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:15,130
you change ecosystem you have to

00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:17,110
purchase the content again so the

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,940
leverage mr. Hixton refers to is the

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,830
ability to provide prohibit third

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,870
parties from making media playback

00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:25,270
devices that do not conform with the

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,250
will of the rights holder of the drm

00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,230
dwork that could mean anything from

00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,680
device manufacturers needing to pay a

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,780
fee to allow playback or to an outright

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,090
prohibition of competition in the media

00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:40,510
playback space for a particular drm file

00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:42,520
format extending mr. Ramon's argument I

00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,140
believe anti-circumvention laws fail at

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,390
doing what they claim they are meant to

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,760
do stopping widespread unauthorized

00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,560
copying but in doing so they only

00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,480
magnify the harms they caused and

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,240
succeed at another effort that isn't

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,580
overtly acknowledged as mr. Hixon argues

00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,530
that effort is stopping economic

00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,840
activity that either competes with

00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:04,360
incumbent industries reliant on strong

00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:08,250
copyright enforcement or that does not

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:12,070
otherwise conform with the

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:14,020
so how bad are Canada's new

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,670
anti-circumvention provisions well if

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,460
you look at the text of the Copyright

00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,930
Act they turn out to be very prohibitive

00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,640
the definition of technological

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,810
protection measures in the Copyright Act

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,150
is any effective technology device or

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,210
component that in the ordinary course of

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:33,490
its operation controls access to a work

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:36,100
to a performer's performance fixed in a

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,840
sound recording or to a sound recording

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,780
and whose use is authorized by the

00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,270
copyright owner or restricts the doing

00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,100
with respect to a work to a performance

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:48,460
performance fixed in a sound recording

00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,620
or to a sound recording of essentially

00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:54,640
every type of expressive activity that

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,560
comes under the scope of copyright so as

00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,540
I mentioned earlier those new and old

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,370
user rights I was just talking about you

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,710
don't get to enjoy them with a DRM

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:06,130
restricted work in Canada you can't make

00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:09,130
backups of streaming video if it's drm

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,990
protected for example so canada has

00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,000
largely and unfortunately followed the

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,680
very restrictive example of the United

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,490
States Digital Millennium Copyright Act

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,570
which several years ago added anti

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,270
circumventing circumvention provisions

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:25,480
to American copyright law you are not

00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:27,760
now not allowed to circumvent drm even

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,490
if it's for an otherwise non-infringing

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,270
purpose like making backups or making

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:36,430
YouTube video remixes you also can't

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,890
offer circumvention services to other

00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:41,310
people for the most part by offering

00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:44,020
services the Act refers to and I quote

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:45,640
offering services that are either drm

00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,520
sir convention or do not have any

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,670
serious purpose beside drm sir

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,620
convention to the public and

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:56,620
manufacturing importing distributing

00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:59,560
offering for sale or rental or providing

00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:02,440
any technology device or component that

00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,740
is either for DRM circumvention or does

00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:08,350
not have any serious purpose besides drm

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,560
circumvention so now we have several

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:13,560
exceptions to this ban which make

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:17,020
certain aspects of it less harsh

00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,270
particularly for certain ITV and ICT

00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,730
related professions so these include

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:24,010
circumvention for law enforcement

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,290
national security of course sir

00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,699
convention to provide for

00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:32,440
interoperability of computer programs

00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:34,050
for encryption research to stop a

00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,839
third-party collection of your personal

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,760
information circumventing with the

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,760
consent of the owner or administrator of

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,620
a computer computer system or network to

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,600
assess the vulnerability of that

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,399
computer system or network or correcting

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,500
any security flaws which basically means

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,980
that pen testing if you're authorized

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:56,829
you can do as long as you have all the

00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:01,240
permissions in line of all the systems

00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:03,040
your pen testing drm sir conventions for

00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,079
the sole purpose of making a work

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,019
perceptible to persons with perceptual

00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:10,060
disabilities so there's an accessibility

00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:12,370
allowance here circumvention just to

00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,170
make an ephemeral referent of a work for

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,060
the purpose of broadcast undertakings

00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,589
because of course you know Rogers in

00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,889
Bell and Telus don't want to be annoyed

00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:23,350
and drm circumvention for gaining access

00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:26,889
to a telecommunication services by means

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,810
of a radio apparatus there are also

00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:31,000
various softening measures in the

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,880
copyright act to reduce the consequences

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,579
for some circumvent errs so if a library

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,889
archive or museum or an education

00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:40,779
institution wasn't aware and had no

00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:43,329
reasonable grounds to believe that they

00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,160
were breaking DRMs then the only penalty

00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:46,480
they could face as an injunction which

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,899
means I just have to stop they don't

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,970
have to pay any money to anybody any

00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:54,310
other individual or organization who had

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:58,120
a similar good faith belief could face

00:14:54,310 --> 00:15:01,569
reduce damages if a civil lawsuit for

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:05,019
damages goes through however there are

00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:08,560
also harsh criminal I want to stress

00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:10,720
this point criminal penalties for those

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,959
who knowingly and for commercial

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,959
purposes circumvent drm or offer to

00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:19,750
circumvent drm or who manufacture import

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,899
distribute offer for sale or rental or

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:25,930
provide drm circumvention technology if

00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:28,660
you get charged with doing this you can

00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:32,589
look at a fine up to 1 million dollars

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:34,089
or jail for up to five years or if

00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:35,710
either of those aren't enough you can

00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:38,320
have both at the same time

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,480
to put some perspective on this we have

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,540
a section 280 of the Criminal Code of

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,330
Canada which has a specific offense for

00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:49,720
which the maximum prison sentence is

00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:52,720
five years that criminal act is child

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,210
abduction in other words according to

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,400
the federal government child abductors

00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:59,560
in people who offer to help back up

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,140
someone's DVD collection for a fee

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:06,430
deserve to face the same amount of time

00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:08,650
in prison the only people who don't face

00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:11,650
this risk our persons who are acting on

00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:14,110
behalf of a library archive museum or an

00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:18,450
educational institution who are

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:20,530
apparently not as bad as child abductors

00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,510
so connecting all this to our

00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:24,340
conferences theme free software and open

00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,350
source let's look at some concrete

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,510
examples of how these anti-circumvention

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,880
provisions will affect open source in

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:33,220
Canada I'll particularly really looking

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,940
at Linux distributions and distributors

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:40,450
and enthusiasts windows 8/rt so the are

00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:43,090
a RM based devices Apple's iOS devices

00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:47,530
locked down android smartphones and

00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:49,840
tablets and the open web so bhuntu and

00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,430
fedora will probably be okay actually

00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,560
Fedora will certainly be okay but it

00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:57,430
wont to almost definitely so we've owned

00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,340
two offers the lib DVD CSS library for

00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,510
download as part of an optional

00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:04,330
repository that you can enable yourself

00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:06,400
it isn't included by default so what the

00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:07,930
package basically does is on the vast

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,339
majority of your commercial DVD so your

00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,680
Disney movies and what have you there's

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:16,300
an encryption system called content

00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,670
scrambling system so linux desktops by

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:23,350
default don't have the ability to

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:25,959
decrypt CSS as it's called so with this

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:29,770
package live DVD CSS you can then watch

00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,970
your your Disney movies so boo doesn't

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,040
include it by default and does

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,600
explicitly warned potential downloaders

00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,400
to check with your local laws to make

00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,530
sure usage of it would be legal in your

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,330
area so I think it wont to in canonical

00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,070
or how about themselves covered pretty

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,560
well for Canadian distribution as

00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:46,510
they're not claiming that Canadian users

00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,110
have any rights to actually use and

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,110
download the package

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,750
yeah I exactly they could say something

00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:57,370
like that fedora which is which is a bit

00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,560
more hardcore and freedom is one of

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,390
their four foundations they don't make

00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:05,080
it available at all within any of their

00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:09,010
official repositories but some other

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:11,560
popular ones do include live DVD CSS by

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:14,170
default the default release the popular

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,240
Ubuntu based distro Linux Mint does

00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,940
include it by default as does the home

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,950
theater focused XBMC live and the

00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,470
lightweight crunchbang linux systems

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,420
I've actually recently found the default

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:27,790
release of Linux Mint on promotional

00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,170
live DVDs inside Linux magazines that

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,300
you can see for sale and some

00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:34,060
convenience stores and indigo books and

00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,830
what have you so unless Clemente Lefevre

00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,960
and the rest of the Linux Mint team is

00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,030
indemnifying those publishers and

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,940
bookstores when they're not too busy

00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:44,800
drinking Matt a with cinnamon which I

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,920
doubt they could afford even if they

00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,560
wanted to then those magazine publishers

00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,960
or bookstores arguably could face civil

00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:57,010
and criminal penalties for what they're

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,770
doing if you're a friendly neighborhood

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,530
PC Reviver you should tread carefully if

00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:04,270
you sell services to say refresh old

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,220
windows machines with a default version

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,750
of Linux Mint you could face some of

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,460
these penalties if you've been doing

00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,840
this and get sued and you can show that

00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,480
you weren't aware that you were

00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:17,770
distributing live DVD CSS although by

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,060
now everybody is aware sorry guys then

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,980
you might be able to get a court to

00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,670
lower the amount you have to pay but you

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:27,100
don't get completely off the hook

00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:29,740
microsoft that dying monopolist gets a

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,200
lot of help from this law so all a RM

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,510
based Windows 8 RT devices like the

00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,490
newly announced nokia lumia tablet which

00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,960
apparently have people excited because

00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,410
it supposedly has a really bright

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,530
display they all have what's called UEFI

00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,660
so it's a bios replacement so what it

00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:49,030
does is it it initializes the hardware

00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,840
when you turn on the power on your

00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:54,460
laptop or in this case probably tablet

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,410
and then it executes a payload which is

00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,000
usually a bootloader which then loads

00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,920
your the kernel and then the rest of the

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,750
operating system so it's the first

00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,730
program that Windows 8 runs when

00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:07,090
you turn on the computer and on Windows

00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:09,220
8 RT devices there's a secure boot

00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,890
feature of UEFI and so that's

00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:14,140
permanently enabled and locked then you

00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:16,720
also can only download new software from

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,220
Microsoft's proprietary Windows Store so

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,340
which means that Canadian users of

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,530
Windows 8/rt devices not only can't use

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,990
any apps not approved by Microsoft they

00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:28,300
also can't replace windows 8/rt with

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:32,380
Linux or Android and still comply with

00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,910
copyright law so that's pretty bad like

00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,380
one of the classic ways that desktop

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,270
linux has made inroads into the

00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,250
mainstream has been a geek telling a

00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,020
friend with an old and slow computer

00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,790
that they could breathe new life into

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,920
their hardware by wiping windows and

00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:49,390
installing linux but that can't happen

00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:50,920
for Windows RT devices apple also gets

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,680
help from these provisions and so do

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,120
lockdown Android device distributors so

00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,220
you know those shops you sometimes see

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,160
in malls and they offer to unlock your

00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,500
phone for a fee whatever unlock memes so

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,000
Apple and Amazon could really threaten

00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,970
them and maybe even get the police to

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,010
arrest them in threaten jail time if

00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,290
unlocking sometimes means circumventing

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:14,080
the iPads BSD jail and installing the

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,910
alternative App Store Cydia or executing

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,190
a root exploit on a lockdown Android

00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,690
device and installing cyanogenmod

00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,070
because your Android device is an older

00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,600
device from back when unlocked

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,610
bootloaders weren't as common as they

00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,800
were now or because you have a kindle

00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:30,130
fire and that definitely does not have

00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:33,850
an unlockable bootloader but possibly

00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:36,940
the worst implications for open source

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:38,380
and digital freedoms is drm being woven

00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,050
directly into the Internet's

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:44,920
infrastructure through the encrypted

00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:47,800
media extensions proposal for html5 so

00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,810
html5 is the next version of HTML so

00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,030
which is the underlying markup language

00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:55,330
powering websites the World Wide Web

00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:56,890
Consortium also known as w3c they're in

00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,500
the midst of defining an html5

00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:02,920
specification as an open royalty free

00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,480
web standard so html5 includes a number

00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,390
of new and exciting features over the

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,880
previous edition of HTML so particularly

00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,470
you have the ability to handle

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,150
multimedia playback natively without

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,040
relying on proprietary plugins like

00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,170
Adobe Flash

00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,690
so YouTube for example offers html5 is

00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:22,300
an alternative to flash for watching

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:25,900
many of its videos now Google Microsoft

00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:28,030
and Netflix in an unholy trinity have

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:31,210
co-authored a proposal for encrypted

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:34,410
media extensions or eme to be included

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:37,690
as part of the w3c html5 specification

00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:40,080
so what eme basically is it's an

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,640
application programming interface that

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,850
extends the native multimedia playback

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,520
functionality of html5 and it allows for

00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:51,580
the playback of drm restricted media

00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:54,970
through html5 through your browser so

00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:58,000
last month the w3c announced that eme is

00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:00,490
in scope for possible inclusion when

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:06,850
they consider refreshing the html5

00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:09,100
specification at HTML 5.1 in 2015 now

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:13,480
it's important to emphasize that IM e is

00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:15,120
not its self drm it's just an API which

00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,090
allows for separate javascript-based

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:22,120
proprietary drm systems to tap into the

00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:24,670
websites already existing html5 code so

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,030
open source browsers like Firefox could

00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,950
ship with eme support out of the box but

00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:33,730
they could still be locked out of

00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:36,790
playing say Netflix videos if Netflix

00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:40,270
implements a DRM through eme that say

00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:43,030
checks the browser user agent cease fire

00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:47,260
fox or even Linux and refuses to show

00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:49,510
any videos or even worse you can imagine

00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:52,300
that Google implements a YouTube drm

00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:58,240
that refuses to show videos if chrome

00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:59,320
isn't a string in the user agent I will

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,390
be getting to that but I think you're

00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,390
right yeah so the implications are

00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:06,340
really bad with anti-circumvention laws

00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:08,350
in Canada the Mozilla Firefox web

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,180
browser or even Linux itself could be

00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,280
forbidden from offering Netflix or even

00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,260
YouTube support this could lead to a

00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,330
huge user migration to one particular

00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,300
proprietary browser that supports both

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,530
Netflix and YouTube out of the box

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,270
reducing competition in the web browser

00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,950
space and threatening the open web as a

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,269
result

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,740
so even if you think that the YouTube

00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:28,529
scenario might be unlikely given

00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,029
Google's financial support in Mozilla

00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:32,529
last time that Mozilla was thinking

00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:34,269
about choosing a default search engine

00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:37,480
for Firefox which is how they get a lot

00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:39,039
of their money it looked very time that

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,029
they might have actually gone away from

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:44,590
google and gone to Microsoft's Bing I

00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:47,289
suspect that that possibility help them

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:49,690
squeeze a better deal out of Google now

00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:52,210
Google in the future could use eme in

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,220
the threat that YouTube drm would refuse

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,500
to accept traffic from Firefox they

00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,360
could use that as a stick to get Mozilla

00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,340
to agree to a deal that's more favorable

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,880
to Google next time it decides which

00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,649
provider to use now I've seen arguments

00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,149
that the w3c the world wide web

00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:09,940
consortium is actually in a relevant

00:25:07,149 --> 00:25:12,909
toothless organization so one funny

00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:16,510
article is online they call the w3c a

00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:18,909
restaurant you have it offers places for

00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,320
various parties to sit and chat about

00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:21,909
their concerns and ambitions and then

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,590
they take some payment in exchange for

00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:26,260
providing the venue and that's all that

00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:28,840
they basically can do so so the argument

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:31,090
goes that since w3c has no actual power

00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:34,809
to enforce browser makers to do or not

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:39,070
do anything it defining eme as in scope

00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:41,139
for html5 isn't really a problem because

00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,850
it is happening anyway so you can

00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:45,970
actually look on the public chromium bug

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:48,429
tracker as my friend mentioned to see

00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,710
eme implementation already happening

00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:52,389
which means Google Chrome will get it

00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:54,940
when it rebase is off of chromium

00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:56,860
sometime in the future and if you look

00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,899
online on the Microsoft website internet

00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:03,010
explorer 11 on Windows 8 that already

00:25:58,899 --> 00:26:05,500
has eme support included the problem

00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:08,590
with this argument is that when you put

00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,990
anti-competitive infrastructure into an

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:14,019
open standard that's managed by a

00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:17,049
supposedly neutral organization you help

00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:20,169
these dominant Internet companies evade

00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:23,139
antitrust and anti competition laws so

00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:25,510
if a particular proprietary eme plug-in

00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:28,240
from google becomes a de facto standard

00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:30,870
which given Chrome Android and YouTube

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,740
has Plaza plausible future in

00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,750
competition regulators get annoyed

00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,480
Google could just try to point to the

00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,890
w3c until judges who

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,530
might not be the most computer savvy

00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:43,000
people in the world hey hey come on

00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:44,950
we're just implementing an open web

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,230
standard look it's fully documented

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:49,059
there's even a royalty-free patent

00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:54,220
license and everyone can use it like

00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:56,830
what's the problem if we do no evil if

00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,600
the w3c rejects eme that Google doesn't

00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,640
have that obfuscating argument to make

00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,970
if antitrust regulators start to get

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,720
interested now things could get better

00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,770
there may be some softening of the

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,950
anti-circumvention provisions at the

00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:14,049
regulatory level as the law does allow

00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:16,210
for the making of regulations that can

00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:19,000
loosen the ban on the act of

00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:21,010
circumvention itself so the regulator

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,049
has to consider the following elements

00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:24,870
in crafting regulations to make

00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:27,340
exemptions from the circumvention band

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:29,740
whether not being permitted to

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,320
circumvent could adversely affect the

00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,929
use a person may make of a work when

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,750
that use is authorized whether the work

00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:40,179
is commercially available fair dealing

00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:41,860
considerations whether circumvention

00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:43,929
could adversely affect the market for

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,179
the work whether it's commercially

00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:48,130
available in a medium and inequality

00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:50,799
that is appropriate for non-profit

00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:54,900
archival preservation or educational

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:59,290
uses and most significantly any other

00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,669
relevant factor meaning the regulators

00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:03,520
at the Canadian Intellectual Property

00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:05,620
Office could dramatically soften the

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,890
anti-circumvention laws when they start

00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:10,120
to write regulations another way things

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,770
could get better is through a court

00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,450
challenge now the best argument I've

00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,480
seen for this is from has anybody here

00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:18,220
heard of Michael Geist flip your hands

00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,080
awesome yeah so he's a Canadian law

00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:22,690
professor at the school I graduated from

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,520
the University of Ottawa it's basically

00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:26,950
a really technical constitutional

00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:30,490
argument so basically our Constitution

00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:32,320
the one from 1867 divides lawmaking

00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,580
powers between the provinces and the

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,410
federal government's there are certain

00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,210
spaces where the provinces can write

00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:40,630
certain laws and the feds can't and vice

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:42,309
versa so this is why the Supreme Court

00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,200
of Canada says we can't have a national

00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:45,820
securities regulator because the

00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,980
provinces have power over something

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,900
that's called property and civil rights

00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,309
so what that means in English is

00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,559
basically the provinces

00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:56,649
have essentially exclusive rights to

00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:58,870
regulate all commercial transactions so

00:28:56,649 --> 00:29:00,759
Michael guys suggested that the Supreme

00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:03,370
Court's views on the constitutionality

00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:05,470
of a national securities regulator means

00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:07,120
that the anti-circumvention for it and I

00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:10,809
just talked to you is probably

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,179
unconstitutional because it's not tied

00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:14,950
to copyright infringement right you can

00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:16,120
fall afoul of this and you could and you

00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,669
can do everything else right you know

00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,499
you could be doing your fair dealing is

00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:24,039
all in check and everything else but you

00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:25,840
could still fall afoul so what Michael

00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:27,970
Geiss is arguing then well then this

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,649
anti-circumvention provision doesn't

00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,999
really have anything to do with copy

00:29:29,649 --> 00:29:33,549
rate which the federal government has

00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:35,019
the right to to write laws and but all

00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:36,399
it has while it's doing is you're trying

00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:37,960
to tread on what the problems is saying

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,730
you're saying you can't make these

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,720
commercial transactions involving

00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:45,490
circumventing drm so what could happen

00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,379
is we could get a test case where say

00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:49,330
you know one of those cell phone

00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:51,490
unlocking stores you know if they get

00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,809
arrested or sued they could wire up and

00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,789
they could go to the courts for several

00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:56,289
years and the lawyer could say you know

00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:57,700
this this is unconstitutional what

00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:59,830
you're doing you know you have no right

00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,119
to put a law like this and like at best

00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,830
you have to actually tie it to

00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,139
infringement you can't just penalize

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:08,049
people for circumventing without tying

00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:09,519
it to copyright itself and the judges I

00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:11,169
think there's a good chance that they

00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,269
might say yeah yeah you're right okay

00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:14,950
feds you got to back off you have to

00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:17,440
stop suing and arresting these people

00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:20,440
and you have to rewrite the law and so

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,230
if we actually then get them to rewrite

00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,820
the law to actually tie the prohibitions

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:30,669
to infringement you actually take a lot

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:33,490
of the teeth out of the provision so to

00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:35,409
conclude things that I painted a they do

00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,090
look pretty bad in certain places you

00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:39,610
will linux distributors are going to

00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:41,230
have to be more careful even linux

00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:44,409
magazine publishers are going to have to

00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,399
be more careful if you start if you

00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,830
think you want to do a start-up

00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:51,580
refreshing people's pcs with linux you

00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:52,990
have to be pretty careful and i wouldn't

00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,419
be surprised if mozilla was a bit

00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:59,409
spooked about this because the EMA

00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:02,379
provisions are are not great at all but

00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:04,899
hopefully we might see that future where

00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:06,909
there will be this kind of test case

00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:09,009
challenge and will either get this

00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:11,320
provision overturned or will really just

00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:19,529
knock the teeth out of it thank you very

00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:19,529
much I'll take your questions well yes

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:51,279
right well I'm glad you brought that up

00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:53,769
so if if some of you aren't aware

00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,749
there's been negotiations between Canada

00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:58,479
and the European Union for a free trade

00:31:55,749 --> 00:32:01,210
agreement there was an announcement last

00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:02,950
week or two weeks ago that there is an

00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,929
agreement in principle reach meaning

00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,429
that there's a mutual understanding of

00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:08,259
what's going to be agreed to and in a

00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:10,839
couple of years will actually it'll be

00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:14,129
in force as a treaty and so as all trees

00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:16,059
override your domestic laws basically

00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:19,450
unfortunately we don't actually have the

00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:21,700
draft text because conveniently the EU

00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:23,499
has lots of different languages that

00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,879
they're required to translate their text

00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:26,830
in before they can release at all so

00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:29,049
this is unfortunately we just have to

00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,909
speculate but some of the things we see

00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:34,539
me that there have been things about

00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:36,070
anti-circumvention in there but from the

00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:37,899
statements the public statements that

00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:39,669
have been coming from the canadian

00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:41,950
federal government indicates that the

00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:44,499
law that was just enforced last year

00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:46,359
actually meets all of their requirements

00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:47,889
on the EU side so I don't think on the

00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:50,830
anti-circumvention level we'll see

00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:53,919
anything worse what we might see there

00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:56,169
though is is an extension of and

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,809
probably a retroactive extension of

00:32:56,169 --> 00:33:01,419
copyrights length in most parts it's the

00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:03,700
length is life of the author and then 50

00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:06,159
years after their death and then anybody

00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:09,039
can have free reign over it the u.s.

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,739
it's life Plus 70 and so the EU wants it

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,059
to be life Plus 70 meaning we'll have 20

00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,799
years we're just going to have like a

00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:18,090
total desert in the public domain where

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:21,779
things just won't enter in automatically

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:23,159
I I don't know about that again I can't

00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:25,110
speak to it because I haven't seen the

00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:33,020
draft text like and nobody seemed to

00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:33,020
draft text unfortunately yes yes you

00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,650
you

00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,930
you

00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:57,990
well I haven't followed to see if you

00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,280
know if there's been some of the cases i

00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:01,110
mentioned we're say that are there been

00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,610
some people with small cell phone stands

00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,750
and like a small town in alberta who

00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:08,909
have been charged or something like that

00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:10,590
i was largely due to pressure from you

00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:14,700
know the big copyright industries

00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:16,590
hollywood most notoriously so that

00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,090
that's been like the real interest in it

00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,460
and and i wouldn't i wouldn't discount

00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:22,950
the possibility of it actually being

00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,399
used if there is like a big major player

00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:41,550
if there is an innovative startup right

00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:43,740
yeah i'd actually would have a lot of

00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:46,649
hope of the Supreme Court of Canada cuz

00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:48,419
we actually had really good results

00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:51,149
really good user friendly results on

00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:52,649
copyright a couple years ago and they

00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:54,149
actually have a really big appetite for

00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:56,340
copyright laws a couple years ago we had

00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:58,710
what was called the the Supreme Court of

00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:02,220
Canada copyright I think was a pentalogy

00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:04,770
I think we had about five five cases

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,900
being heard in one year of the Supreme

00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:09,330
Court on copyright and pretty much all

00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:12,030
of them were a slam dunk for users in

00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:14,730
like in really big ways and they've said

00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:16,380
before in the past on major cases that

00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:17,820
the user right stuff like the fair

00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,980
dealing they need to be interpreted

00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:22,020
really broadly or else we won't have

00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,810
this balance so there's always this

00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,830
reference to this balance between users

00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:28,020
and creators which I don't really

00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:30,960
believe in but you see this a lot in in

00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:33,000
these kind of decisions so I wouldn't be

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:37,350
surprised that if it works up its way

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,880
you know to appeal court's someone goes

00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:41,220
to supreme court of canada with it and

00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,080
says look we have a copyright case i

00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,730
wouldn't be surprised if they were to

00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,830
take it on and i and i really wouldn't

00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:48,030
be surprised if they actually gave the

00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:54,590
kind of result that I was hoping they

00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:54,590
would give yes

00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:23,240
by the Americans I I can't speak to that

00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:24,530
to whether there's extraterritoriality

00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,380
so this is what you're referring to if

00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:30,710
there's like an extra territorial claim

00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:32,060
I'm not sure I mean if they were i am

00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,160
not certain what if they were offering

00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,770
services to Americans saint-like over

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,000
the web and then they crossed over into

00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:39,079
the u.s. and they're under US

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,910
jurisdiction like they had been

00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,280
violating this anti-circumvention

00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:44,660
provisions as a result right and their

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,910
website was still going and was still

00:36:44,660 --> 00:37:02,900
offering your services you can see

00:36:46,910 --> 00:37:04,280
something happen I believe yes because

00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,060
they were offering services to the

00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,260
Americans yeah there's a ton of

00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:11,150
conflicting information about what was

00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:14,150
called extraterritoriality when it comes

00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:15,500
to enforcing laws regarding activities

00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,880
or in commercial activities over the

00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,619
internet so basically what that means is

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,839
you might be in Canada but other

00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:22,339
countries will try to enforce their laws

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,839
against you because you happen to have a

00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:27,829
public-facing web site and you offer

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:29,569
services to other countries given that

00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:32,420
there are lots of countries in the world

00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:35,900
and and their laws are so complex i

00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,520
really can't give any kind of coherent

00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:47,930
answer to that and in this kind of

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:48,440
context like i can write so whether

00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:49,880
whether

00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,770
would then give them jurisdiction or if

00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,020
your website is hosted then on a US

00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:56,270
server right well if you have like a

00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,829
dot-com domain that's being hosted and

00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,660
say like Rackspace and Atlanta or

00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:07,420
something like that and then if you have

00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:07,420
that territorial connection then yeah

00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:23,089
right we now have fair dealing

00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:31,400
exceptions specifically for parody and

00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:33,470
satire no no no no fair dealing is is

00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,060
you don't need permission so if you

00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:37,250
wanted to if you wanted to make a play

00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:41,480
like a short play making fun of harry

00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:42,859
potter and then you don't have to get JK

00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:47,030
rallies permission you don't have to

00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:50,089
give her a cent unless you know that

00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:52,160
well but she's paperback books are

00:38:50,089 --> 00:39:02,210
really hard to drm unfortunately or

00:38:52,160 --> 00:39:05,810
fortunately right right no you would not

00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:10,520
that's correct so what if you were able

00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:12,650
to yes that's right yeah if that if the

00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:17,829
work was only available in a drm form

00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:34,339
and you had to break the drm so right

00:39:17,829 --> 00:39:35,369
right right for sure right yeah yeah I

00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:36,599
got another

00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:39,089
example is anyone familiar with like

00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:41,940
let's play put up your hands let's play

00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:43,349
videos okay basically what it is is the

00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,589
sometimes see on youtube you'll have

00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:48,420
enthusiasm they'll actually record will

00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:49,829
do like a screencast and only commentary

00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,749
them playing along to the whole thing

00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:52,829
and apparently lots of people instead of

00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:54,749
buying video games and playing

00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:57,960
themselves will just watch someone else

00:39:54,749 --> 00:39:59,130
for thousands of hours by it I guess it

00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,210
could be useful for your video game

00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,289
reviewer and you want to see what the

00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:04,019
end looks like so you can make some

00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:06,960
comments but otherwise I'm so let's say

00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:08,700
that the game you wanted to do a let's

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,119
play of it was only available on Steam

00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,650
and it has some kind of DRM at that it

00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:16,950
would check to see if you were using any

00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:18,420
screencasting technology and it would it

00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,410
would refuse to either start playing or

00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,029
would stop playing if you were to

00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:23,430
activate it so if you were to try to

00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:26,190
circumvent that DRM so we can do a short

00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:27,240
screencast that would say like a parody

00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,950
like say you wanted to make fun of

00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,569
half-life 2 which is probably really

00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,609
easy to do I mean the guy never talks

00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:36,809
right lately if anyone's played half

00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:39,049
life 2 okay I guess not so that in that

00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:41,640
situation yeah like there there would be

00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:44,900
you would be at exposure for these kind

00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,900
of claims that I've addressed earlier

00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:12,299
right so it's like a contractual freedom

00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:14,369
argument right why shouldn't I be free

00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:16,920
to put drm on their own where expression

00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:19,109
that people be free to buy these kind of

00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,190
works right and I think that holds a lot

00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:24,599
of water for that and I end I toss and

00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,160
turn between and I sometimes actually I

00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,920
lean more towards the contractual

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,619
freedom side but I don't like is the is

00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,660
to have it in law to say that you know

00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:35,190
if you break this you're as bad as a

00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,170
child abductor like I don't I don't

00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:40,289
think anybody likes that right and I

00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:41,609
think that it you should be able to i

00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:44,089
don't i don't think there's anything

00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:45,989
wrong with trying to break it just for

00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:48,710
non-infringing purposes like just to

00:41:45,989 --> 00:41:51,589
make sure you know you don't lose

00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:52,849
your data your DVDs your music so you

00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:56,060
don't like if your kindle break so you

00:41:52,849 --> 00:42:03,170
don't have to buy you know Jane Austen

00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:05,000
all over again I'm not as familiar em

00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:06,830
but I understand that there are that

00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,780
they do I think they do say that we are

00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,369
licensing to you the ability to read

00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,290
this book from this device and we can

00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:33,050
track you while reading it thank you

00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:34,339
very much so right any other questions

00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:41,630
from anyone else who hasn't asked a

00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:44,359
question yet okay that's I'm glad you

00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:47,000
brought that up we do have one on CD RS

00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:49,880
right because even if which is

00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,339
ridiculous because it's just a form for

00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,750
storing media like I could buy a CDR to

00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:54,980
want to put a linux distribution land it

00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,270
as I imagined them several people in

00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,099
this room would want to do and I'm not

00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,910
like that the presumption that if I'm

00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:03,230
buying a CD are like I'm probably

00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:05,030
infringing copyright I find really just

00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:08,060
really distasteful really offensive and

00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:10,940
so there was an effort when the law the

00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:13,430
new law was being debated about whether

00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:16,670
to include just so called updated

00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:18,020
include things like USB flash drives and

00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:22,130
SD card so that which mean would be

00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:25,609
raising the price of these items and

00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:27,619
stores to cover a pseudo royalty towards

00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:30,230
these copyright collective licensing

00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:32,060
organizations the Conservatives saw

00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:33,650
right through that and then a couple of

00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,630
asked some quite pointed question saying

00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:38,359
like what like what you want people to

00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:39,589
pay you for nothing like well that's a

00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:40,880
pretty nice business to have people

00:43:39,589 --> 00:43:43,250
paying for nothing like they saw right

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,780
through that and so so that isn't the

00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:47,119
case at all you like you if you buy an

00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:49,970
mp3 player if you buy any kind of other

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:53,060
digital audio player USB flash drive or

00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:54,740
SD card there is no royalty that's being

00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:58,450
added on there's no hidden tax that goes

00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:58,450
to any licensing organizations

00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:11,350
I don't believe so anyone else yes so as

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,020
I think alluded to earlier in the talk

00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,890
that you know iOS devices are locked

00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,940
down I think they have a locked

00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:17,470
bootloader and they're in what's

00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,810
basically called a bsd jail because

00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:21,820
they're based off of freebsd so BS

00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:23,470
details basically very limited user

00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:25,090
environment where you have very limited

00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:26,860
access you don't you don't really have

00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:28,120
like file manager access for example

00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,710
right and so that's why people get all

00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,820
these rude tools is basically and that's

00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,650
why it's called jailbreaking because

00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,250
you're breaking out of the BSD jail and

00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,170
you're getting full administrative

00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:37,210
privileges to the system which means you

00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:39,100
can install things like open source

00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:40,900
applications in city are like an

00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:43,630
alternative app store and theme your

00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,970
device so since you could since though

00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:47,530
the bsd jail could be considered like an

00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:49,120
effective technical protection measure

00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,520
under the law because it restricts

00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,860
access to the doing of things with with

00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:57,580
iOS with the iOS system which is as

00:44:53,860 --> 00:45:00,010
software is copyright protected that

00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:01,600
would routing that except with the

00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:03,040
exceptions that i mentioned earlier like

00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,900
that wouldn't be allowed and with

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,360
lockdown Android devices it's the same

00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,860
it's basically the same thing it's

00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:11,170
becoming less of a problem with lockdown

00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:12,520
Android devices because in Canada

00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:14,770
unlockable bootloader zar everywhere

00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,240
like I think the galaxy s4 has an

00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:18,370
unlockable bootloader here as does the

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,950
HTC one which is unfortunately I think

00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:27,420
not the case in the US but they still

00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:31,600
actually have them but in canadia yeah

00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:38,130
right yes yeah it changed there was an

00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:38,130
exception which wasn't renewed right

00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,870
right

00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:48,190
routing and iOS or Android devices in

00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:49,749
those situations except for those

00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:51,729
exceptions like you would fall afoul of

00:45:49,749 --> 00:45:54,759
the law if you're doing it commercially

00:45:51,729 --> 00:45:58,539
you can go to jail for the same time as

00:45:54,759 --> 00:46:13,989
a child abductors maybe really like to

00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:16,509
hammer that point right I can't speak to

00:46:13,989 --> 00:46:18,549
the carrier unlocking unless if that is

00:46:16,509 --> 00:46:20,799
enforced through a technical protection

00:46:18,549 --> 00:46:28,809
measure you you wouldn't be able to

00:46:20,799 --> 00:46:32,799
unlock that Oh Oh excellent I didn't

00:46:28,809 --> 00:46:34,569
know that thank you rob okay alrighty

00:46:32,799 --> 00:46:36,249
well thank you very much and if anyone

00:46:34,569 --> 00:46:37,869
is curious on a totally unrelated matter

00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:39,519
i have influenced to touch running on my

00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:41,890
nexus 4 if anyone's curious to see you

00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:43,839
can come on down i have 10 handouts here

00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:46,059
because i didn't think people would want

00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:48,460
to listen to this in droves but if you

00:46:46,059 --> 00:46:50,259
want to come down i can if you can get

00:46:48,460 --> 00:47:04,479
