kiss summary of the button where we are

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:28,500
projects in physics where the recent

00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,210
activities the work we're doing with

00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,860
Senate collagen lives release and then

00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:39,090
not what he shall I and Webb was she so

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:43,200

again Chad will my Marcia are having a

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,840
box it having answered question so if

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,670
they remember project we believe that

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,570
every student with web browser should

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:58,560
access to high quality online we have a

00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:00,570
possible so please take some areas that

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,170
we focus on what one which is like

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,660
sucker for doing or Eugene online Google

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,610
office hours so good collaboration and

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,410
the traditional one too many which is

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,510
what i'm doing here now and you can

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,800
typically recommend you this road if you

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,760
don't know anything about your server

00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,420
the global source and so does sugar

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,570
typically other than that you can

00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:24,360
collect records of 25 angeles he could

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,310
go higher but we're not developing 11

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,310
our allocation when you can broadcast to

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,440
200 people that you will modify the air

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,670
pressure the future but now you're going

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,540
to let it the highly flattered

00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:38,870
environment so couple screenshots we

00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,900
have the core capabilities for

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:47,040
cooperation that's are sharing audio

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:52,080
very chatty rotation area and video and

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:56,220
with the presentation area and you get

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,950
like zoom in zoom out i can highlight

00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,590
entity but this look designed for

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:04,200
teaching online but model was a teacher

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,850
sir exceptional but I've world of

00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,570
presentation walking students through it

00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,700
chat back for a new key dragon as well

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,400
but here's an example we were testing

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,350
negative at for HD webcams and you can

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,360
see the front anything above his flash

00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,360
based flash is the best

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,469
in town for access to the webcam seeker

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,300
on a community of ec no certainly been

00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:29,520
working a lot of a up i'll share it

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,770
evolves there's a couple more

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,939
screenshots I think that will settle

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:37,770
materials to prior included today it is

00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:39,389
an example to i equal clattering you

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,280
need to click on one of the webcam they

00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:44,819
like and go to secure think that will

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,039
buy I'm Chris quick here's another

00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,520
example of this general nine people we

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,860
set up a 20 people care of your games

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,250
and when you would go and play back as

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:59,460
well capture all the medium to audio the

00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:03,750
video slides chat and all the events

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,639
who's talking John who left into we are

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,460
not at the session and we can process a

00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,400
book this is example like that all over

00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,110
my blue desktop sharing get a web page

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,900
and this is unique cuthbert thousand

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,779
volts when you smoke Marty synchronizing

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,319
data but ultimate you moms and the

00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,319
doctor Bigelow

00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,360
give credit to the other almost

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:28,540
arthritis and rebuild on he particular

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,850
two of them it could be this about right

00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,450
by which is open surgical occasion from

00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:36,400
go be flashing sir and research which is

00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,440
our stop switch which it meant which is

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,780
doing all the audience for sure now that

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,690
this moment on very quickly in a moment

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,330
the video is even better at five so it's

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:50,110
going to request abroad casio the audio

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,970
is going to pre switch back to us I'll

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:56,200
show you how doctors at the road are to

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,730
see some statistics inevitable when I

00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,970
remember under over and listen very

00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:03,280
active over last Thomas five years now

00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:05,710

you did for me out o.o or fifteen

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:11,830
hundred times and gave up SD battling

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:13,690
right there 1527 even course it while

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:18,100
the conversations going on here I

00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:20,740
remember we have children 2.4 k legs and

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,320
face with Danny bundle in SS action

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,139
organic and clear or almost at sea not

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,650
always

00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:31,020
if utilizing the 35 languages can't say

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,789
enough in April was a year older program

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,180
graduate occurrence for accelerated

00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:37,740
program open source projects and we're

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,960
the only open source part of a

00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,569
money-back guarantee you can't install a

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:49,770
light 30 minutes are left plus we'll

00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:52,740
give you right back metallization was

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:56,039
good this is where you needed help so so

00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,740
you can see this is a screenshot repent

00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:02,520
affects all these languages all ten

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:06,090
percent coverage you move down here this

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,860
sonian is ninety-seven percent so I need

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,759
their localization the trigger a better

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,349
community around below little project

00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,779

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:34,480
hook left you test them with our beauty

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:37,149
we've got now on a fourth date candidate

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,110
right you see the different probably go

climbing wall yep communication Senate

00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,439
college work very hard over the last

00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:02,319
number of months to add the support

00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:05,259
necessary disabilities the email of

00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:09,490
specifically students were wide screen

00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:11,019
here I guess we're sliding head home the

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,620
tech school for the light board so I

00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:16,209
brought a text here as well that teacher

00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,290
was pulled through by a merchant company

00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:21,639
that used to be but now for my room

00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:24,819
there's a layout manager so it makes it

00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:30,639
really easy for students anja layout so

00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:32,170
i can she to lay up here i can move it

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,110
around so you guys see how the

00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:43,360
rotational layout home even hear you

00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:45,040
said the vault there you guys we have

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,470
need the product simpler by unifying

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,779
utilitarian to gain chat at any

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,689
qualitative law working this you all get

00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:54,310
Nene Park course and then there's Tanika

00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:56,769
that's a fair point integration your job

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,050
to get guy and you have support for my

00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:01,950
ass FBI

00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:04,620
rules probability the quick vigilance is

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:08,850
what brought used to look like in terms

00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:11,850
of the two windows now it just one very

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,950
quick anytime you can make the product

00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,920
more powerful but any easier we know her

00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:19,680
head director action more patrols the

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:24,570
whiteboard behind the lines look cool

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:28,500
little side down destruction text am an

00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:30,720
adult oriented oh nanjing layouts and

00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,240
this is a this is an example of what

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,700
senator college did it so they in

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,940
addition to making that product battles

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,550
commuters for a while working in trading

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,500
keyboard shortcuts did your boy you have

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:47,700
ability keep the camera interface heat

00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:51,380
who are sure cuts to the chat for the

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:54,620
cheese and focus to temptation or have

00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:57,720
in control of you are and the presenter

00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:00,240
lots of work anyhow sure how many of us

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:04,820
audit accessibility and you to enter a

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,820
book them for this a Seneca College

00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,870
there's a JavaScript interface here or

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,760
just indicating the product yeah this is

00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,899
poultry my editor company that they

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,850
would let it slide your budget and we

00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,959
haven't been able to dynamically set up

00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:25,680
the layout and parameters for a user

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:28,740
corporation projects and turn to the LTI

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,360
certification and now certified so you

00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,060
can seem to be easily inside of

00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,899
blackboard here's your energy other

00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:39,870
products pls that supports soon an LTI

00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:43,160
tool we are not certified okay nuh makes

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:46,050
it easier to video but needs elsewhere

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,870
for the web map you're going to leave

00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:51,089
the html5 web RTC one of these something

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,630
like a bizarre stuff to the brain and

00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:57,930
increment recordings there are some

00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:00,360
components that unity 11 / client secret

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:05,250
video playback bullying share notes

00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:07,220
right over here opens I roadmap key more

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,959
things have supported regular languages

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,399
drawing a mathematics

00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,680
Kundalini you a pre-flight checklist but

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,480
make sure that your requirements set up

00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,700
correctly or you have enough bandwidth

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,970
to you giggle but that just looks floors

00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:26,860
were cross and the ongoing projects have

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:29,230
so in kind of the court fell into the

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,899
button remember what is going on send

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:38,130
them over a year now I'll be shot by I

00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:40,690
and web urgency so over a little now

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:43,270
deletion of my client what we want to do

00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:46,899
is when I moving lunch of coming to the

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:49,450
59 buddy environment but I mean any

00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:51,760
mother property be able to either at the

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,410
people by and I got into the All Stars

00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,890
Project you don't really everything more

00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,810
shot we didn't get a release so we got

00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,779
in stages and we learn as we go along

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:05,230
for sure the first days is a fewer

00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:07,449
client so if you truly you just knocked

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:10,120
out quiet environment with a web page

00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:12,790
you can see my presentation you see me

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,260
and hear me he threw it shell and I

00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,510
would see you here it will sink us so if

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,370
you have a user course that would be

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,920
sufficient where you that for most times

00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,679
tickin statements in lecture a lot of

00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,540
times a viewer planning comes an

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,189
employee with a large and reviews in the

00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,990
lectures like one bullet without entire

00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:30,550
application that's couldn't being what

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,380
mine would be able to do a web

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,440
application you wouldn't be able to talk

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:39,309
or share you with an email with you to a

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:43,420
shot so that's what we're looking at the

00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:46,750
personal nice called a fly the phase two

00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:50,470
is pick up day one at 2am beneath their

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:52,480
ucweb I can see and they scream he is to

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,090
build on the Bruce Lee phases and a

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,210
doubt the capabilities to allow somebody

00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,480
on each multi-client be present that

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:04,020
will slice and everything I'm doing here

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,020
from the am station

00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,130
screenshot this is like a flashlight of

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,260
the right hand side html5 client left do

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,180
you see our role of the basis that make

00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:16,720
sure that where were you received by

00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:18,640
platts you to promise to be the 11 is

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,250
you don't have to absolutely can you

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,680
some real I want the note that something

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,840
the most the most exactly in st. clear

00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:29,710
difference he didn't stop media

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,390
different size their scale but divided

00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,940
uh great over one you should see

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:36,490
everyone by underlying this you should

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:40,930
see double what I see we won't see in

00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:43,450
your purification of fire fire we get

00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:48,010
more scrub pad as well as earlier title

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:52,180
URL in the ipad each OS HDD ice cream

00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:54,430
machine do you have a video some design

00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,800
that we were doing on you I so we want

00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:59,050
to just take the UI nation of my client

00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,660
core class to say look with black

00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:04,360
clients that HTML yeah we want to do a

00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:09,220
nice native HTML flatline they would

00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:11,800
work well variant left well the mobile

00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,150
client a little something different but

00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,370
this is that your work habits in the

00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:19,810
larger space here we just make the

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:22,270
presentation for beauty and then just in

00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:26,560
early just mostly for being boring mui

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:30,510
so toolbar over here miscible you

00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:33,970
akadate whatever webcam chat exitos and

00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:35,710
click with see the user to us this is

00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,320
this reflects you don't need to see this

00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:43,240
all the time most of time focus is to be

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:48,490
on the presentation so i want to have a

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:51,040
talk about audio people but how we did

00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,950
with web RTC or doing our duty to

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:58,900
perfecting it so in the flash right now

00:19:53,950 --> 00:20:01,420
my audio is going from my flash line to

00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,520
read five and it is actually going about

00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,760
important research so it basically

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,230
identify and sift bollock research

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,730
saving of your planet there as well and

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,880
if we pick up the phone and called in

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,780
the audio bridge unbecoming bhopal come

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,550
into the PSTN

00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,380
oakland hour and it would be vicious

00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:25,130
research as well I would see that phone

00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:29,660
call all right here ok so to do the

00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:31,820
html5 client we actually have to create

00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:35,360
another server infrastructure where

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,760
unicredit's for data store no for the

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,090
sharing of events and you need to

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:44,990
multiply and backbone jas most of my 35

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:48,230
strictly as well and either j the CSS

00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:50,660
really you're up html5 is a chance to to

00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:53,150
simplify 2i end to build a funny that

00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,130
hopefully will not broader the ability

00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:57,550
to developers so just do an equalization

00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,550
about

00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:05,739
and it's just overview of how videos aim

00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:07,539
for the awning video you don't have web

00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:10,299
RTC which is not support in all browsers

00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:12,579
we will look at broadcast audio we go

00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:15,819
ladies next task important broadcast

00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:18,429
video tell us using the g shaker teams

00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:20,919
are but recently I applied like they

00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:23,489
added each other soon as well so going

00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:23,489
to use that

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:30,070
ok so I'm gonna come to Arkham City so

00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:35,019
let's go back to what are the challenges

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:37,389
ahead so civility presents key with what

00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:39,519
I want to order the requirements for

00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:42,610
releasably button he isn't the following

00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:45,999
order stability first usability then

00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:48,159
features that scale it so anything new

00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:50,710
our goal is always going to be 11 more

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,389
stable postulates last week's is pretty

00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,210
stable this one will be really good as

00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:57,190
well we would like to stay up to

00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,649
hundreds of our own students if the new

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:03,190
order line html5 you got any investment

00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:05,109
in custody worshipper of users the

00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,809
challenge the Liberty Steve's a priest

00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:10,619
here for it all we need a server sent

00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:14,950
emotive offices parking recordings so

00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:16,749
what we've been doing is instead of

00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:19,629
going to be good with our pc audio and

00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:22,059
video billion a moment

00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:25,419
challenge with it audio is much easier

00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:29,039
to wrestle to just because we have

00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:36,220
research increase which supports

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:37,749
kilograms 144 feet further to see an x

00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,450
rays whatever you're now coming into

00:22:37,749 --> 00:22:42,190
class through to ESPN for over 40

00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,619
presupposition joining a mission

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,499
together and it was a vexing through

00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:51,249
there Johnson's love it's dependent

00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:53,529
region in the content duration so to do

00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:55,600
the weather pc call the browser need to

00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:57,519
be able to sit baldwin browser or two

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,889
libraries are we looking at j/s sip

00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,259
consider all five and blowing back for

00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:05,109
community and they set up will say one

00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:07,230
component as well don't take a look at

00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:09,789
block again this is what the audience

00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:12,369
the only thing up was about five minutes

00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:15,039
see if you're not back this is a delay

00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:17,230
of this sub I'm testing this with what

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:20,200
if Justin now if you guys won't do it

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:23,619
but Chad words you talk and I say one

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,989
soon as I hear you says lon says to love

00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:28,809
your check the tubes I say three this

00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:31,960
battle for is very quick to

00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:33,609
determine the late season I'm standing

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,990
in front of you we can move back for

00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:37,780
funny inside

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,790
but it took a few seconds for our audio

00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:43,360
for want you to be over the other you'd

00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:45,340
accept at least 27 and if I understand

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:51,790
what Sony I could well for example you

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:55,330
can quantitate the one thing I ki te

00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:58,179
gives us is different on you pal that

00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,309
unlike flash which is tcp/ip days

00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:02,770
another limitation so the flash liner

00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:09,010
here either or not all the audio back to

00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:14,080
go out the pieces jetp and weather are

00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:17,380
you see we have a unique ejs transition

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,929
receiving in volume or so the dog looks

00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,660
like this we make JavaScript calls ml 5

00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:24,790
which makes it free switch to the

00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:28,000
singing part and then what's the signal

00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:33,330
is set up with our ecac give us on

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,650
ustream research 287 receive money and

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:38,440
the idea is that we were to do this the

00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:40,960
same technician al Qaeda fighters law so

00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,690
for routers I supported which we know

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:49,830
those fireboxes poem to be able to do

00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:53,110
with who we are video 32a i am video so

00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:56,320
one might say about the way architecture

00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:58,360
is since we only have the path for all

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,300
your video split this was a vet by

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:04,090
research and because we already have

00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:06,130
built and what's over i need we can take

00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,920
advantage on whether you see if it's

00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:12,059
available not all that flash so the idea

00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:15,010
who i think that said I've gone and

00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:18,300
immunotec with your browser is people

00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:22,150
from what i see we use wherever you see

00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:25,780
so welcome found so far so it definitely

00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:28,000
works you know you know my memory audio

00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,650
isn't key he could who you lose

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,920
everything else but if you still have

00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:36,940
let for audio you have a billion a

00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:40,450
lesson you chose to the cap test so if i

00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:44,559
do this camp at for save some for the

00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:47,240
case normal flash on you let's say 12 47

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:51,300
whether i can see your ass

00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:54,210
that's huge you're now seeing that in

00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:58,680
Australia we provide commercial grade

00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:02,460
audio promising only internet multiple

00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:04,200
parties with recording enable data

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:11,040
inside of a larger application that

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:14,580
provides well who really really he gets

00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,650
it will build where everybody started so

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,440
we need to be lovely testing as well so

00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:22,140
if the homeowner on is that we have to

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,320
be able to scale their users currently

00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:28,500
you dig 11 the bottleneck first and pick

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:31,020
up down without a picture the CPM

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,880
requiring fortran coding speaks this is

00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,520
what we're eating right now vehicle with

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,340
heaps of another non-patent we're coed

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,530
which is very refreshing but like all

00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,540
things and science is never a free lunch

00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:50,010
better than whatever you have paid work

00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:52,140
another big order did so you just need

00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:55,950
to kept without any one sneaks on a

00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:58,910
piece of surgery but we get our proceed

00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:02,040
with will destroy bacteria to see how

00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:07,830
stay out we can what one testicle fine

00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:12,570
header and here we've set out to find

00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:15,560
you fall back to us flash so there's

00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:18,390
more dressing ahead who probably have

00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:21,650
prominent of intensive ol beelibones jo

00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:24,210
sip barbell pretty good button

00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:27,030
definitely from demio this will be a

00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,950
test both to Colette's davis correct

00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:32,400
we'll just awesome her support for

00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:35,070
research once we only have priests wish

00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,100
to accept because it calls their

00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:39,870
security issues as well with regards to

00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:42,570
that a low service attack or some you

00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:45,810
strike strong repulsive I mean that

00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,610
cific bus so 70 more clever to log out

00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:50,090
that we

00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:54,320
Wow client entrega good luck maybe sick

00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:56,660
call and there is handshake that goes on

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,850
when you set up the court ball

00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:01,820
depreciation and this takes about 60

00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:04,820
seconds anatomy so evening let me put

00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:07,790
any one anyway follow me and her people

00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:11,480
sip it takes a bow in 57 for you

00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:15,679
actually research so many of you i'd be

00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,660
down on that or juice and the data

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,820
strengthen what are you see aren't

00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:22,580
perfect so that means we either

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,370
certificate this took us out for a while

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:28,070
we had working with pro increase which

00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:30,230
we didn't get working in firefox and

00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:32,660
probably not require it put the dishes

00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:35,360
here in football reached higher costs

00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:37,460
yet so we thought we were looking at

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,669
lying the working one another and funky

00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:43,850
really good dancer so we'll probably

00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:46,669
need an ssl certificate for which

00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,679
research to accept returns jeannie

00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:50,750
whether we had a part of hot jeans or

00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:53,929
the house yet successful set up so that

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:56,150
for your head but we were headed to that

00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:58,990
will provide a bill for anybody who were

00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:03,320
set up the button it will you ever

00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:05,210
forget that come straight on you there's

00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,220
important work that needs to be done i

00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:10,669
begin the user interface or slightly

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:16,340
above our microphone for example this is

00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:19,929
what firefox curly does your prompt

00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:24,530
someone says something I diploma do you

00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:26,299
share the problem here is you just love

00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:29,120
getting feedback on which many phones

00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:31,940
active so we see many classes with a

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:37,309
button or a unit with plenty of you then

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:38,840
hear your speakers work but sometimes

00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,669
their needs to get help in terms of lose

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,290
my phone today especially if you've got

00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:47,090
a laptop and other web daniel iphone SI

00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:50,299
need to have at least three audio source

00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:52,040
of q strong so what you want to see here

00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:55,210
it may be some strength educator with

00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,840
some buyers something user to this

00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:00,929
microphone they'll actually get

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:05,539
see this applet one supposes going into

00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:05,539
the session going hello hello and Billy

00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:13,440
Chen is he back from the villa festival

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,510
Roger weeks ago some folks in the web

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,740
RTC which is a really good by the way

00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:21,870
there you're awesome people but one of

00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:24,630
the other challenges is browser support

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:27,110
so we should I worry we worked on all

00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:29,250
girls are like two simple but it's not

00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:31,429
firefox and chrome Gavin we the ones

00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:35,190
that are pushing hard with her to see

00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:37,260
Internet Explorer people info RCC

00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:39,750
differently to Microsoft's great they

00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:41,940
had a very well in standard and would

00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:44,520
expect over client little sniffly nashua

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,799
referencing standard and the exaction

00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,770
our standard lately still at still in

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,620
development they have scroll off long

00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:55,529
waiting last year terms early both with

00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:59,940
both google chrome and mozilla firefox

00:30:55,529 --> 00:31:01,710
now however i can see anybody so do

00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:05,370
anything special work before i am going

00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:08,929
to be both setting changes with her

00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:12,659
apple wisdom burning on the iOS Apple

00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:17,960
real that's not no indication of any web

00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:21,510
RTC it actually be in a real mess

00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,940
however firefox chrome significant

00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:27,270
amount of the market especially Firefox

00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,549
OS and Android from our pc so when me

00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:31,320
four times milla growler measures will

00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:33,179
provide it but maybe it would be less

00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,610
important that so many people have

00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:39,510
android phones and firefox OS does

00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:42,779
America in 1d thing its iOS you know I

00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:46,080
love to be able to do it by playing how

00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:49,200
do you lower receiver can I had her iOS

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,750
device but he can happen unless my

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,510
personal Apple is it and they don't

00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:58,190
chase will have Siri client and one of

00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:58,190
the two way audio device

00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:08,200
which will do we are been doing that are

00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:11,320
html5 RPC affecting your chair so let's

00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:14,019
talk about video audio is nice because

00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:18,190
piece which will do all for publication

00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:20,860
all but there's no similar thing and

00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:23,970
video video present a toaster red card

00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:27,039
if we want to do with our pc video

00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:29,500
there's no flash right the browser us do

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,899
it the brown have to talk to some server

00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:35,529
that fitting stuck below courtesy video

00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:38,260
which we're looking the EPA and elmo is

00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:41,830
this net wear blush like piece to 63

00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:44,380
years use explorer point to read by see

00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:48,909
you he told you it doesn't have any

00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:51,399
dreams for real affinity ETA and one of

00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:54,100
the nice thing to do is you doing here

00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:57,610
here on the phone or of our pc audio or

00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:59,620
watch your step next together trying to

00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:02,470
keep that same little around anywhere

00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:08,740
you know we don't care flash or rather i

00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:10,960
share my webcam you see it to do that we

00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:16,149
have to have one week whole unit talking

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:19,809
to the other key so this MCU for video

00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:21,639
is it free switch is it another living

00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:25,510
like my code or some other open-source

00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:29,080
meet holding its first video we don't

00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:30,669
know yet there's still uncertain but I'm

00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,710
not worried that I'm not worrying

00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:34,960
there's so much activity going on a

00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:38,340
letter perfect but there will be some

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,500
emerging formats that rope personally I

00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:44,409
eat I need to be audio which is key for

00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:46,690
long person sorry how big object in

00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:48,549
terms of quality that we can offer for

00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:51,880
most students that's that's that's

00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:56,740
really good glasses more than Apple the

00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:59,080
video part I wouldn't say they mentioned

00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:01,750
like loading that will help presents you

00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,639
there others and you may be exemplified

00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:07,950
the duty of any you go through some

00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:07,950
separate source 22

00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:17,790
so in summary where we are we definitely

00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:19,740
we're like a nation of pipeline for over

00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:24,869
a year you're going to see a lot more

00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:27,359
news a good for a year Carolingian and

00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:28,919
each version of the core to the ancient

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,800
power these are this is a pretty good

00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:36,840
seller what our pc audio we're reading

00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,659
as soon as possible you can further

00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:42,149
limit for months there still issues

00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:45,869
figure out armed security big piney

00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:48,540
connect but these are just having both

00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:51,720
names when we compare those oh then they

00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:59,070
slowed by bullfight yes hun will come

00:34:51,720 --> 00:35:01,230
after the first year and that's the

00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:04,020
summary of where we are the project

00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:08,070
we're ahead to the roadmap we're trying

00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:10,800
to you incorporate pipeline in fort lee

00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:15,180
webber to see audio video or just John's

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:18,330
head these are basically quite a more

00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:25,020
information and this money more than

00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:27,590
that amount of emotions both Sam how

00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,590
much time do we have

00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:11,530
alright Fred can you hear me is our

00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:15,640
feedback alright so the first question

00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:19,150
is is there a hand raising and speaker

00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:31,500
queue or a queue of hand raises so you

00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:35,140
can answer questions you can see the

00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:37,810
reception you raise your hand there

00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:42,250
Harris and see the reefs hand out goes

00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:45,220
the top he had people deception and so

00:36:42,250 --> 00:37:02,589
he granted bola frequent off just for

00:36:45,220 --> 00:37:04,329
volumes what's all open source but it

00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:17,290
works in anything uses the flash one of

00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:21,069
the html5 is their support for chromium

00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:24,930
as well as chrome in flesh and yeah it

00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:24,930
is the same thing isn't it I think

00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,710
there's some issues on many desktops

00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:49,690
with acceptance for the flashes through

00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:52,810
dialogue given thing is that flash but

00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:56,980
in all other sports any updates of the

00:37:52,810 --> 00:38:01,480
spirit leads to flash on links there a

00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:04,300
lump 02 / groan chroming the pro has an

00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:07,990
interim flash illiterate so he gave up

00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:11,770
on unrelated version of flash includes

00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:15,720
to those who have to do only they

00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:15,720
basically responsibility

00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:45,670
so the third question is the there's a

00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:50,160
limited number of active participants

00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:53,589
for listening and sending audio is their

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,589
capabilities for making a unlimited

00:38:53,589 --> 00:39:19,779
number of just viewer clients for the

00:38:56,589 --> 00:39:23,440
audio yeah for streaming purposes so we

00:39:19,779 --> 00:39:27,369
haven't tried to build the street

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:32,109
humiliated flash the solutions been

00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:35,109
followed or communities any we're trying

00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:38,289
to build alone our application first one

00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:40,829
built I've ever application we have 20

00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:43,420
people talking point i'll check what

00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:44,769
here's the letter I patient you just

00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,920
simply that what we're talking about

00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:50,680
screenings call so I like to think we

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,710
saw a harder but those you have to fly

00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:56,170
without patient first and then you can

00:39:53,710 --> 00:40:01,410
see over in about five athletes and

00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:01,410
yield a lot larger number of Christmas

00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:16,719
into buddy what's wrong with

00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:19,320
collaboration a twisty upper limit for

00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:23,580
small group cooperation

00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:25,500
is there a so big wooden worked well

00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:30,260
with small group collaboration is there

00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,260
an upper limit to the number of people

00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:41,190
the number of people in the small group

00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:49,200
collaboration that they will but in

00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:54,690
sports we give such a certain number is

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:59,700
21 setting is we have no idea people to

00:40:54,690 --> 00:41:03,750
solve but so did Heather and really on

00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:06,210
project at putting a wheat flakes taxes

00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:08,820
provisioning and testing they just stand

00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:10,890
it up and they look for remember they

00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:14,730
want to find that member it says you

00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:18,420
slowly but the cameras about you and you

00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:20,970
do so we know I was thinking of some

00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,590
consoling rules you look on a virtual

00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,690
machine running outside there with

00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:27,600
address conservator or moons icy

00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:31,130
computer that longer use that line dsl

00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:34,050
connection and a set of the work table

00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:36,240
so we don't get numbers we don't give

00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:40,110
any guidance on how many use your

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,570
service yeah the tester said to me who

00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:44,640
will say they install server steps that

00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:47,750
you recommend look at least 25 use

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:56,360
section I'm a second digital marketer

00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:56,360
and you time to test this answer to

00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:25,350
so two questions the first one is what

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,690
can you expand on the challenges that

00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:32,550
you're facing with the peer-to-peer

00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:36,990
components of WebRTC and how you're

00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:46,500
looking to get around it and yeah yeah

00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:50,400
the challenges in the spec we don't you

00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:53,760
know bunker here free Swisher that wall

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,220
handles all he had a little retail

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,280
stores good as the research project

00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:01,020
there are number of energy to build our

00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,050
building what are conceived a solutions

00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:07,670
around research so he takes care of all

00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:11,520
to sip water is fertile negotiation and

00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:13,950
resource handle they get up streets go

00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,160
ahead give you so it kind of just

00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:18,660
watching over us we just need free

00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,930
sessions only this new use your shield

00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:23,580
up and it's super cool really you know

00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,350
hey i'm on you something australia in

00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:28,650
flora you see what the audience and but

00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:36,090
you're almost like it's just you EP

00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:38,010
based on you so the fact that that what

00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:40,430
are the two script is pretty here you

00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:45,270
know we had a way or there was alive

00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:49,560
surveys or pictures of the video site

00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:52,650
the two parts are we deserve and codex

00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:58,620
this is the default guard us in terms of

00:43:52,650 --> 00:44:01,110
how we operate different products so we

00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:03,450
don't know the answer for the end i said

00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:05,300
it going how he answers everything if I

00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:07,980
I used to work at a large coming in

00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:13,580
pretty sure anyone in super particle is

00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:17,400
maybe I for everything installed it Leo

00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:19,200
turn it on use of you but you know media

00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,610
finding a softness here I have

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,610
everything in the video all

00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:35,720
so Fred are you doing any work to grow

00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:42,769
the the testing community or PF people

00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:49,579
that look for bugs and stuff you around

00:44:42,769 --> 00:44:52,970
us has all this policy for release hands

00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:55,099
clipart syphilis I'm soon in just me out

00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:57,140
people to test and look he responds

00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:59,509
above you will get a response back very

00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:04,819
we pride ourselves as you ensure that

00:44:59,509 --> 00:45:07,309
the community support couch and there's

00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:09,499
extensive documentation American public

00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:12,890
lyrics and melody occupation for the

00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:17,539
next few weeks we surface Oh Lord we

00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:20,059
doing with our CI and we're we have lots

00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:21,589
of information in the faq if you wanted

00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:23,779
to become a contributor for the button

00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:25,970
we actually had a y-intercept so we

00:45:23,779 --> 00:45:27,710
recommend to go through which is no sit

00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:30,470
enough to similarly other open source

00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:32,979
project you know most of the community

00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:35,359
of others take on some small issues

00:45:32,979 --> 00:45:39,140
little relationship with core developers

00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:41,809
demonstrate your skill submit fixes that

00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:44,779
are reviewed and over mine he needs to

00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:47,089
do that you differentiate yourself from

00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:49,670
some of us at hyatt contribute and

00:45:47,089 --> 00:45:56,690
sometimes it I need to the confusion of

00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:58,609
making what war that you we're and used

00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:00,349
to be overly on building an open source

00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:02,599
web marketing system not very easy

00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:05,839
there's just two thousand people who

00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:07,910
require I will do it go get a really

00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,160
good smart for those that are too dumb

00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:13,069
to know it so hard they shouldn't

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,640
believe starting it I don't think we're

00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:15,640
a little bit of both

00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:35,230
for how many people all right what are

00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:37,780
the minimum requirements for sending it

00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:41,290
up for hardware and bandwidth and all

00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:47,040
that for 10 people for for small

00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:52,599
environment sure you are standard

00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:56,530
configurations yes anymore so we lookin

00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:58,839
in a quad core view 16 theater some work

00:46:56,530 --> 00:47:05,020
he said you need computer behind glass

00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:07,710
you get top advisor for negative memory

00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:10,150
he's writing and it before we're fine

00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:13,210
half care about her history reading

00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:16,240
recordings wars better and terms of

00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:19,480
bandwidth 180 mr. seven symmetrical to

00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:22,180
the server and features we rep again

00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:25,510
that each user have one negatives are

00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:28,630
signing down low down elevator and 15

00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:30,700
 the second book now family

00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:33,490
members are not set in stone right so

00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:35,290
you didn't clearly run it higher until

00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:37,660
we got a little bit lower but just

00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:41,260
reflects it as you lower lower on the

00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:44,589
upstream bandwidth your presentation I'm

00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:46,750
going to be a pusher aldea and you

00:47:44,589 --> 00:47:50,500
better than angels are taught in a

00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:52,599
little shopping so on test sir running

00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:56,589
at day without even letting up or

00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:58,060
anything the world Friday but yeah we

fairly strong active and very healthy

00:48:40,989 --> 00:48:46,299
and if you're guilty once you send out

00:48:44,319 --> 00:49:10,349

your what commenting system want to say

00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:37,869
he owed to degrade the quality is there

00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:40,630
any way to adjust the bit rate and the

00:49:37,869 --> 00:49:45,130
compression on the audio in the video in

00:49:40,630 --> 00:50:02,679
two yeah two in a lower bandwidth

00:49:45,130 --> 00:50:05,219
environment very impressed we do give

00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:08,259
all the parameters in the case of

00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:11,739
elevational charter they were client we

00:50:08,259 --> 00:50:14,759
can adjust the quality by the video so

00:50:11,739 --> 00:50:19,599
the heat ball is cut a tube so that

00:50:14,759 --> 00:50:21,999
trade-off p dammit and regulate you can

00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:32,529
we can wear this with the users only

00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:34,239
gmail or readily 125 for year 11 x 960

00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,859
so you should we get the script as the

00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:38,909
hell should be lower and lower

00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:38,909
dimensions to the video

00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:45,650
we recognize that for us to achieve our

00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:55,039
goal of providing a most dutiful high

00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:57,559
quality experience South Africa China

00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:59,510
other places rural area and I want that

00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:01,400
way this is where we are conceited

00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:05,180
United is going to play out very well

00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,829

00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:13,359
cases of slide from previous and

00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:16,760
audience have other priorities very all

00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:18,680
we should be able to achieve coverage

00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,450
with students who are on a path much

00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:32,150
