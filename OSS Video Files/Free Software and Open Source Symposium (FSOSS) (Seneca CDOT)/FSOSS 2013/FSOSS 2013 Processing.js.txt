software my passion is music obviously

00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:09,269
but their passion is gaming serious

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,719
gamer and just way too soon okay people

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:16,500
here it would be Dylan Cigna and Andre

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,070
Capcom the both work in cidade and you

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:25,850
would like to discuss today the

00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:25,850
javascript library for html5 as you know

00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:31,230
teaching so take it away okay thanks for

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,690
the great introduction so once again

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,290
yeah I'm Dylan and we're going to be

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,460
talking about processing Jess so just to

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,110
go over a bit of what we're going to be

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,129
going through here first I'm going to

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,280
just start off with a really brief

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,750
history anybody who's been to the

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,940
workshop yesterday has probably already

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,500
heard this one but just for the benefit

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,660
of whoever wasn't there i'm going to go

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,719
over it again and then i'm going to go

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,219
over some of its capabilities why you'd

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,730
want to use it like what it's capable of

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,649
and then my partner here is going to

00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:09,880
give our personal experiences working at

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:14,520
CDOT working with processing jess so

00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:17,049
processing j/s was created from a

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,140
program called processing which was

00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:22,180
originally written in Java I believe

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,890
2001 I might be wrong about that don't

00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,970
quote me on that but i think that was

00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:30,429
when it was basically it was a java app

00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:34,750
that allowed you to do 2d graphic

00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:36,369
rendering its purpose was really to

00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,060
create a bridge between art and

00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:42,039
programming a lot of programmers weren't

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,599
good with doing art and the other way

00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:45,310
around a lot of artists didn't really

00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,459
know how to program so it kind of tried

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:54,220
to bridge the gap there by creating an

00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:57,700
easy easy language to to use processing

00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:02,140
j/s actually brings actually brings

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:05,369
processing to to the web using html5 the

00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:08,860
canvas so it will parse all the

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:12,860
processing code and render it inside of

00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:16,400
a canvas and the good

00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,410
this is it brings brings it to any html5

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,100
enabled browser so that includes mobiles

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,900
it works with mobiles most most browsers

00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,510
most popular browsers anyways all

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:32,270
support html5 now as long as you update

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:34,520
it to the the latest one so I got a

00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,260
short video if anyone's never seen this

00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,080
this is actually a it's called the gorse

00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,770
video it actually takes a github

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,630
repository and gives you a visual a

00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:47,480
visual representation of of it over time

00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:54,620
and you also see some things come down

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:57,380
on the right hand side using popcorn so

00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,760
in 2008 John ray sick I first created

00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:03,610
processing Jess if you don't know who

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:06,560
seh was actually the creator of jQuery

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:09,680
so he was able to take processing and

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,350
render it in the canvas these are this

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:30,090
is a sum of the first / sketches there

00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:31,430
on the side so I was released

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,319
source project you're going to see a

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,870
short time lapse here we're not much

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:49,090
gets done and then you'll really see it

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:52,290
explode yep so

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:55,450
nine students here at Seneca College

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,879
were tasked with bringing processing GS

00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,430
up to speed with processing and you see

00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:04,840
you can see the video a lot of stuff is

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:08,830
being added there a lot of functionality

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,860
was enhanced so you see the vectors the

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:14,110
the wrecked and the fill actually being

00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:17,829
able to rotate like that without bugging

00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:25,630
ahora you can see it's just getting it's

00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:27,460
just getting huge on the side there then

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,520
one of the things that Seneca had a

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,950
large hand in was actually adding 3d

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,510
functionality so you see 3d spheres here

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:40,300
as well as the you can see the

00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:48,970
spotlights there so here's some 3d boxes

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:49,330
just moving in in 3d they're just some

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:59,139
sort

00:04:49,330 --> 00:05:01,479
Oxford flying around and it's still it

00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:04,289
still worked on today by volunteers you

00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:06,789
can even get involved with working on it

00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:22,330
so pretty big though so it's hard to

00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:33,789
really get into oh yeah it is that's

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:36,129
fine so I'm sorry I wincing yeah okay

00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:38,469
it's fun it's fun music so mario music

00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:41,639
in the background so 2d graphics is

00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:44,680
really it's okay just leave it okay

00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,740
leave it so 2d graphics was really the

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,150
bread and butter of processing like I

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,039
said this what processing originally

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,550
started as this is about processing GS

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,250
it is what's really good at 3d was

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,080
something that was only added recently

00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,610
so it's got all of the math functions

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,930
that you would expect from a graphic

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:07,449
rendering library translations scalene

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:12,400
and it also has all sorts of matrix

00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:15,669
matrix operations it's got a keyboard

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,080
and mouse interaction so you know

00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:19,389
dragging the mouse clicking the mouse

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:23,650
all back all that stuff and keyboard

00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:25,599
presses are all part of its core

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,580
functionality there it's got a lot of

00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:29,529
image supports I mean to be honest

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,719
working with it I haven't found an image

00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:33,449
that doesn't work except for SVG's in

00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:38,080
Google Chrome but that's a chrome issue

00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:43,419
so PNG's gifts svgs and firefox at least

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:45,849
are all worked fine with it so here's

00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:49,949
where the music's coming from so this is

00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:54,580
a game built by a man called Paul max uh

00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:57,009
let's handle anyways so he created a

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,509
really good engine for any game

00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:01,360
programmer so this is what I was

00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,840
interested in just for 2d rendering so

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,220
this is kind of

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:12,919
like you can see what its capabilities

00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:15,410
are right a sound isn't actually

00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:18,860
something that comes with processing

00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:21,710
Jess it this was built in from I believe

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:26,720
it used the minim library for javascript

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:29,840
sound so this really shows you know what

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:35,500
is actually possible with with

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:39,740
processing jasmine and here's a little

00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:43,790
little demo of 3d graphics that was

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,410
created here at Seneca the ball goes a

00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:48,560
little bit fast for whoever made this

00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:51,470
but maybe I'm just really bad this AI is

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:56,120
just beating me in pong but it you can

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:58,220
see everything is moving in 3d and still

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:04,070
it's still a work in progress but it's

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:07,190
it's coming along very nicely for people

00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:10,340
who want to use this one of the but one

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,070
of the better web IDs that I've seen for

00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:17,770
processing is this one's called sketch

00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:21,650
pad here so just show this video quickly

00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:23,750
so you can see here that it's got all

00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,270
the code on the left hand side and then

00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:28,039
it's rendering on the right and you can

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,860
actually see there are actually two

00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,970
people which is the my favorite part

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,370
about sketch pad you can actually do

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:37,010
group programming so it color codes it

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,770
so I think it's like a reddish pink for

00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:43,849
one person and the green rina shell i'm

00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:46,730
not sure but yeah and it just color

00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:50,060
codes what people are doing live so it's

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:53,320
really good for for sharing code and

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,320
just instantly rendering it on the web

00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:04,850
it off to Andre search by school okay so

00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:06,620
I'm going to show off a game that Dylan

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:11,300
and I have been working on Alexa for the

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:13,759
last six months at CDOT and this game

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:17,540
has been built with processing j/s mixed

00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:21,889
in with javascript and HTML CSS all on

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:24,680
web stuff oops ok so the brief demo of

00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:26,930
the game please note that this game is

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,209
on its way to beta so it's not quite

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:35,589
there yet so it's a diamond in the rough

00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:38,420
at the moment so the goal of the game is

00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:42,110
its a math learning game so it's a

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:46,850
supposed to help people practice adding

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:51,410
and indirectly subtracting fractions and

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:53,810
the gold game is that you're a delivery

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:58,370
vehicle you have to deliver parcels to

00:09:53,810 --> 00:10:01,880
different locations and to deliver

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:05,180
parcels you drive across roads and you

00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:08,680
select roads and then and you can also

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:12,639
do select them and then as you go to

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:18,079
drive to delivery locations you get cash

00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:21,050
for delivering goods so right here you

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,899
can see that this part with the kind of

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,959
hopefully light green is the main canvas

00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:30,439
and everything inside of it is generally

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,389
is processing however there's elements

00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:36,769
over top of the canvas here for example

00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:42,709
these are HTML and then this bar up top

00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:45,259
is completely HTML and the nice thing is

00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:49,630
is that they all interact with each

00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:54,339
other so you do actions for example in

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,339
processing oh that's that

00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,220
and then for example when you deliver

00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:05,170
processing can I can update variables

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:11,050
that exist in HTML inside processing

00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:13,620
which I'll talk about in a minute so the

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,360
basically the goal of the game is to

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:20,320
deliver to all locations on a map which

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:23,680
is a generated kind of a pseudo randomly

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,290
and without running out of fuel so your

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:31,510
fuel is a fraction and as you drive over

00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:35,019
roads you will lose fuel and your goal

00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:41,019
is to refuel and get to the last

00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:47,019
location before you run out so let me

00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:50,880
talk about somewhere experiences with

00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:54,910
the game so uh one of the benefits of

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,519
processing jess is that as I said pgs

00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,920
and JavaScript code can be mixed all

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:06,640
JavaScript variables and functions are

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:08,320
accessible inside pjs and HTML CSS

00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,800
JavaScript code can also be generated

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:20,680
inside pjs dynamically let me show you

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:25,390
an example of that so let's start new

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:28,269
game okay so there's this bonus feature

00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:31,300
in the game where if you're driving over

00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:33,010
multiple roads and one of the locations

00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,329
you're visiting happens to be a delivery

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,209
location that you haven't delivered to

00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:39,870
before you can get bonus cash if you

00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:47,380
solve the fraction this helps with the

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:50,769
practicing of addition so most of these

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:54,160
elements are static but right here these

00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:56,680
inner div elements are dynamically

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,199
generated inside pjs so for example

00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:03,520
right now you see three fractions listed

00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:06,950
if let's say I want to add a few more

00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:11,690
look delivery locations

00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:14,240
can do that and now suddenly we have we

00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:18,740
have more so this was done inside

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:22,400
processing jazz and it created divs that

00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:31,210
then were picked up by the DOM and now

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:34,700
they're listed here okay all right so

00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:36,980
another nice feature of processing j/s

00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:40,670
is that it can be completely written in

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:43,610
JavaScript I haven't played around with

00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:45,290
that much myself but there are samples

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,740
you can find on the processing j/s

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:52,520
website that show you two ways of doing

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:55,010
it one is to create a function where you

00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,960
have your set up and draw functions and

00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:01,100
any other classes or functions you want

00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,630
to create and then pass that or yeah you

00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,700
create that function that wraps all that

00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:07,850
and then you pass it into the processing

00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,580
instance and then the other way is to

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:14,150
use script tags so you just write your

00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:17,060
set up and draw functions inside of a

00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:20,900
script tag with specific specifiers that

00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:24,920
you'll see on the website so some more

00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:26,600
benefits of pgs is that you have access

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,560
to everything that the web has to offer

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,720
if excess to HTML CSS javascript jquery

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,440
any libraries you want to use for

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,150
example with this game for only

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,780
debugging purposes is won't be in the

00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:46,790
final product we I use a an XML writer

00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:48,820
class class or library that was written

00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:52,940
in JavaScript to generate xml

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:55,430
specifically for exporting maps and then

00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,220
the biggest benefit of course is that

00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:01,040
you don't have to reinvent the wheel

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,480
HTML CSS JavaScript give you a lot of

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,080
functionality a lot of things to play

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,200
with for once again if you notice here

00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,780
these buttons not a final product but

00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,690
they are HTML buttons you don't have to

00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,890
create processing buttons you could but

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,240
it's just a lot of work that you don't

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,750
have to do because you have access to

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:26,600
HTML in the web the layout the styling

00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:30,170
of these wonderful tool tips right a mix

00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:36,410
of HTML and CSS the animations for

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:39,620
example you see here right they are in

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,510
this case jQuery so there's a lot of

00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:46,000
things that you can do with processing

00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:49,790
GS mixed in with other web elements and

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,640
make it easier for development also

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:56,980
extremely fast prototyping if you

00:15:52,640 --> 00:16:05,480
refresh the page you can write you can

00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:08,960
see changes immediately and now some of

00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,960
the less than stellar elements that

00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:19,430
we've come across as we've programmed

00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:22,850
this game so processing jas elements are

00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:25,010
hard to access in javascript so from

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,960
javascript processing you have access to

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,790
pretty much everything however the other

00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,770
way around it's a little bit more

00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,450
cumbersome you get access to global

00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,070
functions that you can call through the

00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:38,060
processing instance that you get in

00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:41,060
JavaScript but thus far variables global

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:45,140
and local any class instances and class

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,640
functions you don't have access to or at

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,860
least I haven't found them in the

00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:53,360
processing and since they're deep

00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:56,030
somewhere maybe in so what you have to

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,970
do for example what I needed one

00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:02,380
function out of my the driver class

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:05,270
which is which is what the player is

00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:08,150
encode in the code and I need a function

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,470
out of that I had to call in JavaScript

00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,720
so what I had to do was when I

00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,060
instantiated the class I would have to

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,449
set it up set it to a global JavaScript

00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:19,520
variable so you kind of lose some

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:23,900
programming encapsulation there but I

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:28,339
mean you can get access to these you

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:33,800
just have to break some rules the second

00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:36,340
problem as that pjs code campy debug

00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,930
very well in the browser

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,730
you'll see non-existent line references

00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:44,360
in the browser console I'll show you

00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:46,700
that in a second and you could move the

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,520
processing Jess code into a processing

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,280
IDE and try to run it there the problem

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,630
with that is that if you if you have any

00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,920
javascript in your processing j/s code

00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:00,200
you're probably going to fail

00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,720
compilation because the pde the

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,960
processing ide doesn't recognize

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,420
javascript and also by moving it to the

00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:12,260
processing IDE you've isolated that code

00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:14,650
from the rest of your web page so if

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:18,050
again if you're trying to mix javascript

00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:21,230
jquery HTML CSS all with processing j/s

00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:25,330
moving it out and isolating it into a

00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:29,450
ide is going to isn't going to give you

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:33,710
the best debugging so i'll show you

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:36,140
these non-existent line endings so i'm

00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,490
going to add a function that doesn't

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:42,710
exist just going to add a line of code

00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:52,580
and i hope you can see this side this is

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:57,260
the console in refresh and oh I'm there

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:59,450
it is ok so it's saying so it says that

00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,430
the function isn't there doesn't doesn't

00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,500
know what it is but here's the line

00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:07,790
right so it's it's saying that there's

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,380
an error in online 15,000 627 all right

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,990
so we click this because this is an

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,750
awesome part of a debugging in the

00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:17,240
console in the web browser open this and

00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:22,310
you'll notice that there are only ten

00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:23,750
thousand lines so this this error is

00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:25,880
being referenced at a line that doesn't

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,670
exist or if it does it's embedded

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,120
somewhere is some kind of text or binary

00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:33,680
blob because you're you're a code that

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,760
you write in pgs is going to get parsed

00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:40,430
by the processing jas library so you

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,570
it's it's hard to find and you basically

00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:46,870
have to debug with intuition and skill

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,870
and knowledge

00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,670
okay so I'm just going to wrap things up

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:59,590
here so we went over some of the roots

00:19:54,670 --> 00:20:01,600
of pgs how it was created I showed you

00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,440
some of the capabilities its graphics to

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,420
d3 and the 3d that's being worked on

00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,760
Andre showed you gave you some of our

00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:14,140
experiences that good and the bad of

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:17,309
working with processing Jas go ahead to

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:20,230
the so we just have a screen here of

00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:22,030
references that if you ever want to look

00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,799
up any of this stuff yourself you have

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:26,049
the processing jess website where you

00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:28,710
can find a reference to pretty much all

00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:32,890
of their library all other functions

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:35,410
that's there the processing jess is

00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,870
there their channel their IRC channel if

00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:40,030
you have any questions there's always

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:42,250
people there who are willing to answer

00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,169
your questions take a bit of time to get

00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:47,830
back to you but the line to your

00:20:44,169 --> 00:21:13,110
questions and then for the sketchpad CC

00:20:47,830 --> 00:21:13,110
that i showed that's the it oh yeah

00:21:54,330 --> 00:22:02,730
well I think using it it makes creating

00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:06,970
creating and rendering are a lot easier

00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:10,809
if you've ever actually used the actual

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,700
canvas API it's not exactly easy off the

00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:14,350
bat whereas this is a lot easier you're

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,840
literally just loading an image and just

00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:20,320
drawing it at an x and y-coordinates

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:24,460
really simple for anybody really to pick

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,500
up and it showed in the processing Jess

00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,510
workshop yesterday a lot of people who

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,690
had never seen it before picked it up

00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:33,790
really nicely in in just three hours and

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,700
I saw some really good sketches at the

00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:38,590
end of the competition so that betcha

00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:48,940
shows how easy the language is to pick

00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:50,530
up all right okay well if anyone wants

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,710
to ask any more personal questions feel

00:22:50,530 --> 00:23:00,010
free to come up afterwards and will will

00:22:53,710 --> 00:23:16,120
feel free to answer for this excellent

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:18,280
presentation and we had a little bit of

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,740
time so if you want to you're more than

00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,780
welcome to here and chat with them with

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,770
these guys individually probably for the

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:30,070
next or so if you find that you are

00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:32,950
arched you can go to 1209 and get some

00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:35,559
refreshments as well we would return in

00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,800
this room for this particular screen at

00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,800
