thank you everyone for a very warm

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,850
welcome it is really quite lovely to be

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:16,110
here it's a said twice in toronto in

00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:19,619
just in the space of a couple of months

00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,960
so that's been kind of fun as Chris said

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,430
yes i am a linux kernel engineer I've

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,970
been working on the kernel for about 12

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,010
years I've done a number of things a lot

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,290
of them have been embedded I ran a small

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,620
embedded engineering company and got

00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:37,589
involved with helping to maintain device

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,499
tree linaro I was working in the office

00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:42,210
of the CTO which was a really neat place

00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,949
to work because I got to see a lot of

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,260
different areas the industry got to talk

00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:49,289
with both business and engineering

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,489
community members and it's going to see

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,859
where every where everyone's thinking

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,249
and now hila packer to convince me to

00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:58,979
come on board and I'm helping HP with

00:00:56,249 --> 00:01:01,769
their linux strategy for for the new

00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,389
products coming up but this morning what

00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:06,690
I want to talk about we have we have

00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:08,250
video excellent this morning what I'd

00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,320
like to talk about I'm not here on

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,439
behalf of hewlett-packard I'm here very

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,350
much as a community member as you know

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,090
this is we are part of this shared

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,860
engineering community and I want to talk

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,930
a little bit about this and when Chris

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,409
invited me to come and I took a look at

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,340
the at the presentation at the topic for

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,820
the conference I thought you know what

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,340
that's actually a really compelling

00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:37,049
topic to do a keynote on or so

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:40,859
resistance was futile now what I so I'd

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:42,359
like to take an attempt at seeing if I

00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:44,420
can answer that question all right

00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,460
answer the the now log question but I

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:50,609
feel like answering now wat is really

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,950
hard to do without first talking about

00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:55,829
the resistance was futile what does that

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,310
mean well to start with why don't we

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:03,119
take a quick very quick tour of the

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,749
history of open source I found this this

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,660
picture this timeline on on a blog one

00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:11,460
of the Red Hat product managers had put

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,830
this together but I had already been

00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,470
thinking in these terms we're looking

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,870
back from here from 2016 we're looking

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,879
back

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:25,269
at about 50 years of software

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,099
development we're looking back at a

00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:30,030
history that started with the first

00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:33,129
computers where the the norm had been

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:36,610
basically open source software it had

00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:38,470
been the people who had computers who

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,470
had access to the few computers that

00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,720
there were by don't just matter of

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,069
course they were sharing their coat with

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,730
all the people who were involved and it

00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:51,129
was a very much a collaborative effort

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:55,239
things started to change somewhere

00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:58,209
around the 1970s 1980s when software was

00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,760
unbundled from hardware and it became

00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:02,440
less and less common for software to be

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,769
for the source code software for

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,290
software to be shipped with the binaries

00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:11,620
we started we saw the companies start to

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:16,239
realize that software has an awful lot

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:18,549
of value and the there really is the the

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,680
quickest way to take advantage of that

00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:22,569
value is to start following a bit of a

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,299
proprietary model and try to sell

00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:28,450
software as it was a product as you sell

00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:31,440
other kinds of products and this is what

00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:34,599
start what we see start to see the

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,549
proprietary software market form but in

00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,870
the meantime was suffered as part of

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:42,220
that is the open source free software

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,560
mindset wasn't called that at the time

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,030
but that was the start to go away in

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,709
preference for people using the

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:53,590
commercial software that they were

00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:56,109
buying we but we still have examples I

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,940
take a look at BSD that was happening at

00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:01,239
the same time that was still being

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,829
distributed as source we all know the

00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,109
very famous story of Richard Stallman

00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:06,970
getting really pissed off at a printer

00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:09,040
driver that wasn't working and not

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:13,389
having access to the source and that

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,310
being a bit of the catalyst for the

00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:18,430
thing his thinking around software

00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,530
freedom and not just whether or not the

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,180
source is distributed but what does it

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,490
mean that we're giving source way what

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:28,960
does it mean for us to society if we are

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,480
sharing source and then we come round to

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,480
the 90s where we start to see a

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,630
surgeons and linux is linux you know

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,480
lynus published his colonel project and

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:42,090
about 91 we saw a whole bunch of

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:45,330
interest in gains in collaboration going

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:49,040
on through the 90s until through to the

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:52,260
2000s were suddenly in a period where

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,830
proprietary software is giving way in a

00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,600
big big way to free software again and

00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,790
in a lot of ways we've kind of come full

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,730
circle we haven't been on a journey of

00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,860
proprietary software giving way to open

00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,110
source but we've got open source through

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,520
a period of proprietary software and

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,330
then coming right back to where we were

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,840
at the beginning with free software to

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:19,170
the point now where 99% of businesses

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,890
are have free software as part of their

00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:30,770
core in traders the core thing of the

00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:33,960
core what they do so let's talk about

00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:41,640
resistance is futile so it's kind of a

00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:44,490
provocative title so turtle resistance

00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,050
you what does this actually mean I'd

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,290
like to kind of let this boil this down

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,360
let's go back to first principles and

00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:53,040
ask some some basic questions on this so

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,580
first of all if we're talking about

00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:59,160
resistance was futile who was resisting

00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:02,040
well what is what exactly were they

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,430
resisting against or perhaps better

00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:08,220
perhaps more accurately is sorry what

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,130
were they present resisting us and who

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,870
are they resisting against now from

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,690
context I think it's kind of safe to say

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,510
that or we could say we were what we as

00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:22,530
the free software community is what was

00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:24,810
being resisted against but I have to

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,730
admit that's a pretty vague term when we

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,490
saw if we talked about us in them or we

00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:32,360
talked about us and the term that we use

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:37,520
being community that term is very vague

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:40,080
what does the community can consist of

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,650
the obvious answer is to say that the

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,650
community is

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:52,340
the community is the people who can

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:54,740
contribute to a project oops so let's

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,030
actually take a look at this Lennox

00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,580
weekly news has done a number of

00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:03,320
articles that talk about who who

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,370
contributes to the colonel I've died so

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,650
I went and took a look at some of the

00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,780
numbers myself if we take a look at

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,120
who's contributing to the Colonel's the

00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,350
first place is the engineers who are the

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,000
engineer is actually working now I'm

00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,590
going to take this from the perspective

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,890
i'm going to use the linux kernel as a

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,990
case study for free software paternal

00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,580
definitely doesn't encompass all of open

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,990
source and free software but it's a

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,610
really good case study because there's

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,470
been so many people who've been looking

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,300
at and researching it and quite frankly

00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,860
as I was putting this keynote together

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,250
it was the easiest place to go get

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,500
numbers so the first thing to look at is

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,600
there is the engineers and I decided to

00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,090
look at for each kernel release how many

00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,950
individual email addresses representing

00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,200
individual contributors were involved

00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,120
and the numbers were quite staggering I

00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,840
mean we're talking we started out back

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,910
in the 26 I only went back to 2 630 I

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:57,110
could have gone back further but at 26

00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:59,540
30 we have about 1300 developed unique

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:06,290
developers contributing patches to every

00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:08,090
single release we have now this is this

00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,980
by the way this I haven't accounted for

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,450
duplicates email addresses so this is

00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,280
not going to be a totally accurate

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,710
number but it's pretty close so we've

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,780
got about twelve thirteen hundred on to

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:21,080
6 30 and then once we get up to we've

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:26,450
seen a steady increase up to know around

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:31,940
the 1700 mark for the 48 release a few

00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:35,300
months or a month ago this is a lot of

00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,620
people this is a very large net that

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,500
we're casting when we're talking about

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,820
community but is it fair to talk just

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,870
about the developers who contribute

00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,210
patches when we're talking about

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,920
community and I don't really think it is

00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,420
because we're also talking about those

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,920
people who are reviewing those people

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,810
who are testing those people who aren't

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,520
necessarily necessarily going to show up

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:58,740
on the commit statistics

00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:01,500
so the next thing I wanted to look at

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,850
was or just another view of the same

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,980
data I had said that there was about

00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,770
1400 but that didn't account for how

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,680
many actually unique developers or how

00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,610
many carry over when I actually

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:17,070
aggregated it and collected how many

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,570
individual developers unique over the

00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:21,180
whole period of time how that increased

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:24,060
over time we're adding about 300 new

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,010
unique contributors every kernel cycle

00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,560
every three months there's another 300

00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,910
people who show up contribute probably

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,820
just one patch but still they're

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:35,400
contributing you know they're the net

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,950
just got Y Drive but I think 1500 are

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,780
sorry 15,000 people just on the colonel

00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,460
alone and that's not taking into account

00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:45,860
user space that's not taking into

00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,860
account the big projects like OpenStack

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,570
still I don't think I've got a wide

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,920
enough net the next thing that I went to

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,500
look at is the companies that are

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,300
involved we all know that corporations

00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,000
have gotten an incredible amount of

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,710
value and an awful lot of its being a

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,450
hobbyist linux kernel developer is

00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,510
something that tends not to last very

00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,770
long because those developers who get

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,290
out there who get involved with the

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,060
project who start contributing to the

00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,850
project they tend to get jobs really

00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:18,180
quickly and you get companies that are

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,610
involved well in the concept of

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,140
community those companies those

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,820
employers are going to have influence

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,340
over the project they're going to have

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:30,150
an effect on what we value in the

00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,710
project so again I'm not going to call

00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,780
out individual companies because you've

00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,430
seen those statistics before I'm sure on

00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,170
Linux weekly news but I wanted to look

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,870
just at the root at the raw aggregate

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:43,980
numbers just like the developers where

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:46,710
we've got around 1300 developers every

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,330
month we've got around 300 unique

00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,050
companies participating in every single

00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,050
kernel release

00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,700
so my point in going through this and

00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,220
talking about the numbers and the number

00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,650
of people are that are involved is that

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,210
if we talk about community we try to

00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:08,360
talk about community as if it's this

00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:11,000
monolithic thin we try to talk about it

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,040
as if there's that we all believe

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,440
exactly the same thing or that we have

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,750
the same the same goals and that with

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,220
how big we are with how many people are

00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,810
involved that clearly is not the case

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,210
and that there's a lot of people with

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,970
very different goals and very different

00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:28,280
intense so that begs the question what

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:35,480
is it that actually ties us together and

00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:37,670
pulls us together so to take the Star

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,650
Trek analogy a little bit further the

00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,900
the conference title is resistance was

00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:43,340
futile and that kind of gives the you

00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,710
know in the Star Trek analogy that is

00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,230
assimilation that we are all being

00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,610
assimilated into the community but when

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:53,180
I was thinking about it and putting this

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:56,660
together I thought that well I'm not

00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,670
sure assimilation is quite the concept

00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,700
that we're talking about here because

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:04,250
really what we're talking about is we

00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,290
are growing the tent we are growing the

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:09,860
net of who is involved in the community

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,680
we are having we have people and

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,910
companies coming in that have their own

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,920
motivations and goals for why they want

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,330
to participate on the software and we

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,820
are working together and collaborating

00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:22,970
to figure out how to do shared projects

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,160
that support all of those goals and so

00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,980
in my mind when we talk about resist

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,540
resistance was futile this isn't a

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,920
statement of conquest that we have gone

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,930
and conquered the world and free

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,110
software but it is a statement of

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:39,410
partnership where we have been able to

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:42,050
partner and change the minds of how

00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,570
viable open source is and bring in a lot

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:51,250
of companies that originally were really

00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:57,020
not interested in free software so

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:59,930
example I like to I try to tell stories

00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,870
when I'm in doing a keynote because us

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,940
as humans when we're looking at these

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,810
concepts it's the stories that really

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,170
can arrest

00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:12,250
tell us and that we attach to an under

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:16,120
to understand what what we're seeing

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:19,550
let's go back into linux history when no

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,430
mid 90s when linux was really picking up

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,560
and was starting to challenge a lot of

00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,870
the incumbent proprietary industries we

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,580
started to have some you know we got

00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,529
into a bit of a spat with a certain

00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:33,529
large software company in redmond

00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:37,630
washington now when nasty words were

00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:40,970
bandied about like you know cancer or

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:43,370
you know communist just horrible things

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,589
were said and to be honest horrible

00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,620
things were set on eyes our side we kind

00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:50,960
of cheered a little bit when Microsoft

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,820
when we want when open-source won a

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,330
contract that Microsoft wasn't able to

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:59,200
get and things were really really

00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:01,520
there's a lot of animosity okay

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,800
Microsoft for a lot of us ended up

00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,110
embodying everything that was evil about

00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,290
the corporate software world and there

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:13,070
was the we never ever ever want to work

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:15,620
with Microsoft ever want myself to die a

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:19,520
horrible death and go away so that frees

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,170
African run can take over the world but

00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,520
an interesting thing happened if you

00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,060
look back in the last couple of years

00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,890
and you look around lenox conferences

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:30,980
you'll notice an awful lot of Microsoft

00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:32,510
vehicle people around when you go and

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,730
look at the colonel contributions

00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,470
Microsoft is at a respectable place on

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,140
the colonel contributions and also in

00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,880
the other projects Microsoft ships Linux

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,130
software they should have a bun to with

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,280
windows parts of a bun to its Windows 10

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,839
they are working on there's Linux

00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,500
support for Azure and supporting it in

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,839
their platform Linna things have turned

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,130
around entirely that Microsoft by the

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,980
criteria that we were just talking about

00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,990
we have to consider Microsoft as part of

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,760
the community and for some of us that

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,580
was this a little bit galling it's like

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,490
oh wait but I was really committed to

00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,350
being angry at them

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:13,040
but we've seen a change and I think this

00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:16,070
is what this is what I mean when I say

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,020
that the resistance was futile is not a

00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,640
statement of conquest is a statement of

00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,070
participation and that we have been able

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,090
to change the conversation that all

00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,220
these companies that were vehemently

00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,750
opposed to anything that was free

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,910
software because they didn't see how

00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,620
they didn't fit with their business

00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:35,960
model have changed their minds that have

00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:38,500
seen seen the value so if that's our

00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,540
community and if we've got this fast

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,880
array so many different viewpoints in

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,190
terms of Y motivations on why we're

00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,170
involved with Linux how do we ever work

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:52,430
together how do we ever come to

00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:54,410
agreement on what free of you know yeah

00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:58,250
how do we come to agreement how do we

00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:59,570
keep from Terry each other tear each

00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,810
other's throats out when we're trying to

00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:14,390
work out problems that are differences

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:16,220
of value so okay so another another

00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,410
aspect this kind of sounds like a stupid

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,940
question to ask how do we work together

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,830
because the other side of the coin is

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,940
well we've been doing it we've been

00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:28,010
doing it for 25 years of Linux and it's

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:31,190
been successful but if you look back

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:34,160
again that's 25 years is also full of a

00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:37,700
lot of a lot of work and a lot of strife

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,980
and a lot of figuring things out of how

00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,050
we work together because I think that

00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,930
there is a lot of a sum that it's easy

00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:47,330
to start making the assumptions of we

00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,370
all have the same the same you find the

00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,770
same motivations without talking about

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:56,750
it and then not realizing that we don't

00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:58,820
have the the same motivations we end up

00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,110
treating free software as cultural

00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,650
knowledge and I think that we have to

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:07,970
still keep talking about it because if

00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:10,880
we go if starting a new project and we

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:13,250
just try to try to sprinkle magic pixie

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,840
dust over the project we're going to end

00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,699
up with a bunch of developers coming in

00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,980
having very different expectations

00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:21,389
of what the project actually is and

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,990
that's just setting ourselves up for

00:17:21,389 --> 00:17:27,449
strike I'll give you an here's an

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:31,409
example that came up very recently you

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:35,159
may have seen the news of a VAR d pilot

00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:39,029
and andrew trade and trish energy gel

00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:41,630
was but this this is part of a blog post

00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:45,690
that you put on the ardupilot website

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:47,880
just a in September now what happened

00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,460
here is that there was a project spun up

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,460
that joined together several different

00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:57,690
projects that were doing drones drones

00:17:53,460 --> 00:18:00,600
software one of them was ardupilot px4

00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:02,639
was that was another one and there was a

00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,870
number of hobbyists that were in there

00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:05,490
there was a number of companies that

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,960
were involved and everyone was quite

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:10,080
excited about this because this was a

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,610
chance that we that all of these players

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,149
were going to be involved in the same

00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:19,200
way and then a couple of years later we

00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:24,600
end up with this on the coming up on the

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,399
ardupilot blog and so let me be clear

00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,440
here I'm not going to bring this up to

00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:29,820
point fingers at the project or anything

00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,080
like this but I want to highlight

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:35,940
something that I noticed as we were that

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,169
I noticed when this news broke and so

00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,480
here's the statement that part of the

00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:41,309
statement the structure and bylaws are

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,600
built around exceptional power for

00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:44,700
platinum members giving them

00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,130
extraordinary control or the future of

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,110
drone code this is a fundamental flaw on

00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,820
a project meant to promote free and open

00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,230
source software as it means that the

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,760
business interests of a very small

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,679
number of members can override the

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,850
interests of the rest of the members and

00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:02,039
the community now I'm not involved with

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,659
this project I don't have any direct

00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,700
involvement with this here so i'm not

00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:08,190
going to this is not to vilify anyone

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,769
who is involved but what I hear from

00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,570
that statement is that there was a

00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:15,990
distinct mismatch of what the

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:19,380
expectations were now I can easily see

00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:22,440
easily assume that the folks that were

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:25,019
made the decisions to them it looked

00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,850
like a good idea they have perhaps they

00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:29,850
have commercial projects products that

00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,200
they want to ship that it was easier

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:35,250
from a legal point of view

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:39,000
to ship those products if they made

00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,139
these decisions but the problem is is

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,179
that the decisions that were made

00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:44,490
whether or not they were malicious I'm

00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,200
not going to go there but the decisions

00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:50,340
that were made made the art you pilot

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:53,059
developers feel excluded excluded them

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,260
from the made them feel like their

00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:57,510
contributions were valued made it feel

00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,269
like control over the project was being

00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:02,039
pulled away from them and I think that

00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:04,080
situation is this this is just one

00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:06,120
example we see it in other cases and I

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,850
think it's where we don't actually talk

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,830
about what projects don't necessarily

00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,169
talk about what they value and don't

00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:18,630
notice until much later when there's a

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:21,809
mismatch between their values I mean you

00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,820
may say that this is why we're talking

00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:27,360
about this this is this is interpersonal

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:30,210
issues but I go back to my own history

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,370
when I think about this years back I was

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:35,730
working for Canadian company computing

00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:37,320
devices Canada in Calgary I was junior

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:39,840
engineer I was working on a new project

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,090
it was a some tests software's for some

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,130
cool hardware I was having a great deal

00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:48,450
of fun I was pouring my heart and soul

00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:51,539
into this project was going right and

00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:53,490
then one day it was cancelled just there

00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:55,019
the business has gone away and that

00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,950
project was done and the old that whole

00:20:55,019 --> 00:21:01,500
code base was just done it was gone and

00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:03,450
okay so I was an employee i was paid

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,490
their i always knew that the deal was

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,529
this was code i was doing for the

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,500
country for the for the country for the

00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:16,669
company sorry well it was a government

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:19,019
contract so baby it was but I also owe

00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:23,639
unexpectedly found myself going through

00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:28,110
grief write that code that i had porn

00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:31,110
aboard my own intensity excitement

00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:34,860
energy into was no longer something that

00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:38,639
i had access to and that became a big

00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,740
part of my thinking when i was when i

00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:43,590
became familiar familiar with open

00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,220
source is that the involvement with the

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,429
project

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,630
it is not the way that I'm involved with

00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:50,820
the project being involved with free

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,039
software a big part of that is being

00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,440
part of a project that I can be part of

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,480
a long-term that I can have that that

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,980
attachment to and I think talking with

00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,380
other developers this is where I figured

00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,929
out where I finally understood when I

00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,780
heard other developers talk about code

00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:09,419
being expression being artistic

00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,919
expression either even because it is

00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:16,890
something that we have an emotional

00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:19,440
reaction emotional attachment to why am

00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:21,090
i bringing this up in a conference where

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,909
you know most of our talk is going to be

00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,919
about the the technical projects that

00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,840
we're working on because I think it's

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,140
important when we're type of community

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,919
to realize that we as humans are not

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:37,289
these intellectual utama ton's that are

00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:41,190
completely logical and always make the

00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:43,350
best intellectual decisions you know as

00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,090
if we have you know we're bodies or more

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,809
minds that are kind of kind of carried

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:51,000
around by these bodies my modern

00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:54,090
psychology it shows were not that we are

00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,419
we are embody we have minds and bodies

00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:59,210
and our emotions are very much a part of

00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:02,309
the way that we make decisions if

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:05,130
motions weren't a big part of this then

00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:06,870
why did we have so many fights in the

00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,190
open source world why did we have so

00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,630
many flame wars on the linux kernel

00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,789
mailing list if people weren't

00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:20,549
emotionally attached to the work that

00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:23,220
we're doing so to talk about this what

00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:24,720
I've what's become a big deal for me is

00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,710
to start thinking about the way that we

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,419
construct projects I am serving on the

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:35,190
linux foundation's technical advisory

00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:36,809
board and so I and I served for a period

00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,789
of time as the chair of the board so I

00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:42,450
was also sitting on the the Linux

00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:43,860
Foundation Board of Directors and I was

00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,750
LCS to him kind of some of the decisions

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,799
discussions that were being made on on

00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:51,210
how new projects are getting set up one

00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:53,580
of the things that comes up a lot is

00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,169
licensing and we talk about licensing a

00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,360
bit we've spent an awful lot of time

00:23:55,169 --> 00:24:02,220
arguing about what licenses mean

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:04,140
we know there's court cases that have

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,520
gone on on you know is is the GPL

00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,130
actually enforceable in court is the

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,140
what does the bsd license mean in terms

00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:13,650
of patents how do you best manage a

00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:17,160
project and i think that this is this is

00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:19,290
very important all the legal aspects of

00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,179
licensing and the instrumental view you

00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,220
know what does the license do how does

00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:26,210
that functionally work when we're using

00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:30,480
the project but that's only half the

00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:34,200
topic the other half is that licensing

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,270
is very much when you choose a license

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,460
for a project you have to remember that

00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,840
that license also communicate something

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,650
to the rest of the project to your

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:46,290
potential contributors of what that

00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:48,919
project what you value what the project

00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:50,850
values what the contributors

00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,280
contributions are going to be how

00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:58,169
they're going to be valued in the same

00:24:53,280 --> 00:25:00,870
way we've got contributor licensing

00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:01,980
agreements though that's going to

00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:06,720
communicate something to your

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:10,290
contributors on what about what you what

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,950
you value and so what I'm what I've been

00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:16,200
encouraging is when you look at licenses

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,030
what is it actually what does it say to

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,679
your developers now we've got a number

00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,530
of free software licenses I'm actually a

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,720
really big fan I'm a really big

00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:27,929
proponent of the GPL for this exact

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,820
reason there's I think a lot of tendency

00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:31,410
to move towards permissive licensing

00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,240
because from the instrumental point of

00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:35,610
view it gives you the maximum amount of

00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,190
benefit or must gives you the max amount

00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:41,280
of leeway to do what you want with the

00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:45,720
minimum amount of risk but at the same

00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:47,250
time it's uehara you have the risk of

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,080
communicating to your contributors that

00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:52,799
their contributions don't actually

00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,809
matter or even worse communicating that

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,330
we want your contributions and we want

00:25:54,809 --> 00:26:00,120
to take them without you having to show

00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:03,000
you any of the work that we're doing and

00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:06,080
I think that that can you need to I'm

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,090
not saying too that that you must do

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,390
 it up licensing but it has to be

00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,580
aware of that when you're choose

00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,320
project or choosing licensing for a

00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,700
project how that is going to affect the

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:25,450
people that you are going to be

00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:27,640
contributing now I won't Oh as I was

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:30,400
going to say that in terms of these

00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,540
licenses and licenses is value statement

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:40,150
here's I mean here's a little bit of

00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:42,190
hope that's not the right slide I mean

00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:44,260
if you look at the licenses right in the

00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,630
text for example of the GPL you'll see

00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:49,750
that the language that's being used

00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:54,000
right there is value statements free

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:57,220
software is one of the value statements

00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,070
from the new public license or general

00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:03,010
public license is this language of

00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:05,770
freedom which is a value statement now I

00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:08,230
won't talk any more about this cory

00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:11,020
doctorow has done a much much better job

00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:13,890
of it he gave a keynote at lenox con

00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:17,410
this year and he called locket open

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:19,420
which I strongly encouraged to go and

00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:24,250
watch and he talked about free software

00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:29,440
licensing apache bsd and GPL how as we

00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:31,540
choose the licensing this is this is how

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,670
we really took over the worlds because

00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,330
we we got the code out into the open in

00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:41,220
a way that is a river that irrevocable

00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:43,930
there we go i got the word out okay so

00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,750
so that was an awful lot of time

00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:50,920
studying setting background which then

00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:53,590
comes to okay what's next well in my

00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,440
mind what's next is actually an awful

00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:59,890
lot what we're doing right now it's

00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,770
really easy to portray free software and

00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,960
open source software as battling against

00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:07,570
the proprietary world and that's really

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,340
never what it's been about there has

00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:11,290
been a battle against the proprietary

00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,960
world there has been a really strong

00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:16,690
battle for relevance to say that we have

00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,970
a right to be here that we have a right

00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:21,490
to have access to hardware so that we

00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:23,309
can write software and run it without

00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:26,999
having to get around

00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:30,240
locks on the hardware and we've got that

00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:32,480
we've got the relevance now but that was

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,980
a sideshow to do what we wanted to do

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,019
what we wanted to do as a community was

00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,059
develop great software we want to

00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:42,090
collaborate to build great things we

00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:43,889
want to get suffer out there so that

00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,779
other people could take it and do crazy

00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:49,049
stuff that we never thought about in the

00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:54,149
first place and I think that's what's

00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:56,039
next is we get on with that and in the

00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:59,039
midst of getting on with that we have

00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:03,119
some very significant challenges that we

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:06,480
have to deal with right now there's I

00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:09,690
mean all you will be familiar i'm sure a

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:13,249
few few days ago of the the major outage

00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:15,779
on the internet that was caused by

00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:19,490
currents current speculation right now

00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:23,460
is it's a script kitty who managed to

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:26,639
get a large mental a number of botnets

00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:29,999
of compromised Internet of Things

00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:31,679
devices now this is where this is where

00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:34,110
the challenge I think comes for us next

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,029
is now that we have relevance we're not

00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:39,360
worried about that we're on to the next

00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:41,159
big things of not only how do we work on

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,919
our individual projects how do those

00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:45,749
projects work together how do we build a

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,149
system that is robust from a security

00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:53,190
point of view how do we build systems

00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:55,649
that are robust from a from a personal

00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:58,169
communication personal data control of

00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:59,850
your own data so and that's the

00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:05,610
challenge is to go out there keep going

00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:09,710
keep writing great software and an asset

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:09,710
so thank you very much any questions

00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,150
[Applause]

00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:29,140
talk about color Oh where's the mic

00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:31,539
oddly ultra me a question okay go ahead

00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,250
I just you said at the beginning that

00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:35,080
the software was free and then we went

00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:39,070
through a cycle a proprietary software

00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,750
our back full circle yes sorts but

00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,600
what's the situation now with cell

00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:45,580
phones I get the feeling that with with

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,370
Google and Apple that maybe we're

00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:54,250
drifting back but is it my problem to

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:57,460
the old yes yes well and so we have one

00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:59,260
in terms of everything is based on free

00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,389
software but that doesn't mean the

00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:04,059
saying that everything is open and so

00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:06,970
that's absolutely right is there are you

00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:10,179
know big areas of issue right now I mean

00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:14,320
drm is is huge right now the locking

00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:15,730
down of media and it's everywhere that's

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,220
that's going to be a significant

00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,990
challenge because it's going to lock out

00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,309
even if the software is all free is

00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,470
going to lock out actually being able to

00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:27,580
use the software and then you're right

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:32,889
there is the appliance devices now I

00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:35,110
think that I think you're absolutely

00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:37,710
right to be concerned about the the

00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:43,809
lockdown of software on on those devices

00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:45,610
I'm also hopeful and I'm hopeful because

00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:47,769
things are going to get really awful

00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,269
before they get better so that's the

00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:50,470
kind of a funny statement to make the

00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:52,769
reason I think things are going to get

00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:59,070
really awful before they get better is

00:31:52,769 --> 00:32:02,289
companies have you know our technical or

00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:03,549
Internet of Things companies have really

00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:06,010
good at turning up devices they're

00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:07,539
really good at putting device out that

00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:09,850
it gets on the internet and does

00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:12,010
something but security on those things

00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,720
is horrible most of those companies are

00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:17,860
fly-by-night most of those companies

00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,850
don't have any kind of they're not able

00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,160
to support the device

00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,090
that there that are out there the same

00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,390
thing goes for the cell phone

00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:28,000
manufacturers as you know two sides of

00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:31,000
the same coin what I think is going to

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,280
have to happen is that the companies are

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,140
going to realize that they can't be the

00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,510
full software stack developers anymore

00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:41,500
that they just can't do it right because

00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:43,420
they don't have the source to support so

00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,890
if that's the case then what does an

00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,640
operating system look like for cell

00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:50,470
phones and Internet of Things devices

00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,820
that separates the hardware manufacturer

00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,950
who's running at a really low margin

00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,960
from the car from a company or

00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:58,210
organization that is maintaining the

00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:01,120
software stack I think what we're going

00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:03,130
to see what's going to I think what the

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:08,500
industry is going to be forced towards

00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:11,110
is having having that separation which

00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,890
then gets us away from these lockdown

00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:18,040
devices it means that we're going to see

00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:20,710
interestings devices and cell phones

00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,120
over time look more that the like the pc

00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:27,070
market where the operating system is

00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:29,770
separated from from the device I'm

00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:32,560
hopeful with this with Google because

00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:34,450
Google has all these cell phone partners

00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,700
that are building their own hardware and

00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:42,130
Google gets blamed for all the security

00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:44,320
issues so a partner like an oem produces

00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:47,410
a handsets that handset they shipped the

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,560
kernel for that handset Google depends

00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:53,320
entirely on that vendor to ship updates

00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,670
to that Colonel and yet Google's the one

00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,960
with the security problem because

00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:58,510
they're the one with the ecosystem that

00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,530
is broken I think what Google is going

00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,450
to have to do is they're going to have

00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:05,530
to become a distribution that's my

00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:08,650
personal opinion but I think it's is

00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:11,290
something we have to keep working

00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:15,690
towards is fixing the problem of

00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:20,220
lockdown devices other questions

00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:22,940
there's is on but i also think we won't

00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:27,780
get a better world until we have

00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:29,550
customers understand i don't need a

00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,879
descendant they hacked right Colonel

00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:35,550
Korn I mean because the device is shiny

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,889
and new today doesn't mean it's going to

00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,960
be working at six months or a year and

00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:42,119
the customers don't really understand

00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,730
that and when they do understand they

00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:48,000
say oh the life cycle of phone is two

00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:51,780
years old throw it out the customer

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,179
should ask for better I I got a phone

00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:57,240
call at the lead the service department

00:34:54,179 --> 00:35:00,329
of my car dealer phone I have a 22 year

00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:03,720
old car I never would have had a 22 year

00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:08,160
old car 25 years ago the cars have

00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:12,810
improved longevity I think we've got to

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:16,109
teach people to expect no more on the

00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:21,030
life cycle there and that's going to

00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:25,470
drive over source multiple providers and

00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:33,180
all those sort of a that's the question

00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:39,359
how can we I agree I don't know how to

00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:43,099
do that I think that if project if

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:45,450
products stopped working obviously

00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:47,910
there's going to know consumers will

00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:50,069
notice that but our current situation is

00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:53,640
we don't have products that fail

00:35:50,069 --> 00:35:54,900
noticeably know and when there's with

00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,640
the security issues when you've got

00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,790
compromised devices that still appear to

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,770
work or they work slower customers don't

00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:05,250
nest Oh aren't necessarily going to note

00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:06,990
that this how to fix that or what did

00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,790
Amanda there sir so I don't know the

00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:10,050
answer to that question but I think you

00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,950
are right and i think that's one of the

00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:15,369
things we're going to need to work out

00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:24,380
Oh sir

00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:25,670
it's on my desktop I sound like they

00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,980
might have been you might have been

00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:30,529
saying that we consider most ignorant

00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,029
not necessarily it's given but they're

00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:34,609
just ignorant of what your devices

00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:36,109
actually can't go out and that this had

00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,309
been that one there is out there in a

00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:40,069
day and because of their limited

00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:43,369
exposure put your products because they

00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:44,690
rely on Main Street commercialization

00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:46,640
tell them what their they don't know

00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:48,380
that there's other options they don't

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,319
know that there is be fed their device

00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:55,390
for more than what they have yeah I

00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:55,390
would agree absolutely

00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:01,340
any other questions I've been looking at

00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:04,910
this side of the room any over here okay

00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:08,060
it's you previously in the example of

00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:11,480
was it art are you a pilot yes where the

00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:14,090
community felt that selectively a few

00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:16,280
members our country for shin it

00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:17,600
influence yes so I guess those elite few

00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,150
members they did they were also

00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:23,390
contributed so either any money or voter

00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:24,710
another reason yes yes I want to

00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,960
contrast that though at the end of your

00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,640
presentation where you give the example

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,970
of the Internet of Things exploit like

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,500
we had the recent denial of service

00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:35,330
attacks that were on the security

00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,280
research researcher Brian Krebs and then

00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:42,020
later on Twitter and they were very very

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:45,350
effective so I'm wondering who your

00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:47,540
opinion on security versus freedom is it

00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:49,250
possible to have both are they both kind

00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:51,520
of two ends at the same line you have to

00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:55,340
get the sacrifice one for the other

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:58,360
that's a really good question so the

00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:04,390
question is soon own security and

00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:04,390
freedom are they on the same line I

00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:09,170
don't have a simple answer to that one

00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:17,390
I've got some interesting complicated

00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:20,750
answers so I think being able to do both

00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:23,000
security and freedom is possible it

00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:25,130
requires creativity requires thinking

00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,960
about the problem in a different way so

00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:31,400
I had a very interesting conversation

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:36,050
with one of my friends at who's looking

00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:38,450
at security at the LF and he brought up

00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:40,430
the that there is a contract like the

00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:43,820
way that we do security with so with

00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:47,240
cell phones right now is we lock down

00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:49,430
the you know what a root filesystem

00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,530
that's that's locked down we signed the

00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:53,360
colonel we signed the the root

00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:55,910
filesystem and that's how we know that

00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:59,750
we can boot but what do we do about the

00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:01,910
data and the current model let's see if

00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:08,020
I can remember this correctly the

00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:08,020
current model the data is tied

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,860
the date is tied to the user account

00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,260
although my information might be a

00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:22,300
little bit out of date here but what he

00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,670
was talking about is that one of the

00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,350
ways that we can handle the

00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:29,710
functionality of secure boot is we can

00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:33,910
make use of the security features to

00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:37,840
actually enable freedom and keep the

00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:41,020
security so for example if a vendor

00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:44,880
ships are colonel and a root filesystem

00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:48,610
and the security portion of the device

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,610
uses that to the the signature of the

00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:55,330
colonel of the of the company that signs

00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:57,550
the colonel to unlock other keys right

00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,960
so when you provision the device you get

00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:04,240
a root filesystem you get a data

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:07,450
partition that is locked to a key but

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,450
that key is only released based on the

00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:13,510
colonel thats budet so the data is

00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:17,110
you've got a fully protected system but

00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:18,700
if you as a user go I'm going to take

00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:21,850
control over my device I'm going to

00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,870
uninstall the vendor key or you know

00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,940
just leave it in place but I'm going to

00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,380
install my own key and I'm going to sign

00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,700
my own kernel I'm going to sign my own

00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,040
root filesystem and I'm going to put

00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,990
that on the device so now I've got the

00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:35,530
ability to run code on the device but

00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:38,770
the security of the TPM won't release

00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:40,600
the key for the old data partition right

00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:43,180
but that's okay because I'm going to

00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,130
create a new data partition and so

00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:48,100
there's innovative ways that we can

00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:49,600
create secure devices that for users who

00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,640
aren't going to go through those hoops

00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,590
who wanted to you know when it comes out

00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,600
of the box they want they trust their

00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:57,910
vendor and they want to be able to use

00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:00,310
the device it works but at the same time

00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:05,080
the device is usable by those who want

00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:07,210
to take control for either because they

00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,680
they personally value that or because of

00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:10,960
their corporate environment that they're

00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,110
working in or any other reasons why they

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,300
might want to take control over a device

00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:17,320
I thought one of the most interesting

00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,420
things that's happened over the last

00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,049
year is all the kerfuffle over secure

00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,439
boot

00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:25,449
where Microsoft came out with mics out

00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:28,359
pushed for secure boot and there was a

00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:31,420
huge hubbub Alou in our community about

00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:34,410
his secure boot a good thing and this is

00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:36,819
Microsoft's attempt to lock us out I

00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:38,469
can't speak for myself as a whole I can

00:41:36,819 --> 00:41:40,239
speak for a few engineers who talked to

00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:41,859
me afterwards that it's done in

00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:44,559
Microsoft's that that wasn't our intent

00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:46,509
but at the end of it the conversation

00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:50,349
went from Microsoft is trying to lock us

00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:52,719
out to secure boot is a useful feature

00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:54,400
that we can use free software to build

00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,739
secure systems that we ourselves have

00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,160
control over and that's the conversation

00:41:56,739 --> 00:42:07,119
that I think needs to happen first of

00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:19,449
all microsoft has they have locked us

00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:21,119
out of the RT hardware yes and you we

00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:24,099
have to be careful of treating

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:27,189
corporations as monolithic right so

00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:28,689
there's I have great support for parts

00:42:27,189 --> 00:42:30,249
of Microsoft's that are really invested

00:42:28,689 --> 00:42:32,979
in open source there's other parts of

00:42:30,249 --> 00:42:35,019
Microsoft that I'm sure have are looking

00:42:32,979 --> 00:42:38,319
at the way to do things from very

00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:41,679
different lens where it makes sense to

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:43,900
lock things down and we do need to keep

00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,130
bringing that up and keep doing the same

00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:50,559
things that we've been doing all along

00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:53,640
of pointing out where their their design

00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:58,380
decisions or business decisions that

00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,380
impedes the ability to run free software

00:43:00,749 --> 00:43:06,099
if I'm correct I seem to remember

00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:09,219
Microsoft contributions the colonel are

00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:16,929
ninety percent support that's correct

00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:19,719
that's correct it's a good thing it's I

00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:33,009
mean to what about citrix submitting

00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:38,499
patches to support them yeah security is

00:43:33,009 --> 00:43:43,199
a very complicated yes field and it is

00:43:38,499 --> 00:43:48,130
one word doesn't cover it in a classic

00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:50,709
you know these SD cards yes you know the

00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:55,949
essence they're secure you know who it's

00:43:50,709 --> 00:43:59,999
secure from meteor vendors I believe yes

00:43:55,949 --> 00:44:04,059
it secures media content from the user

00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:07,890
who would put that in a name if they if

00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:10,839
the customer no rules against that

00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:13,109
really I mean that's how goofy toward

00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:20,249
security is in our

00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:27,549
very overload to term so security

00:44:20,249 --> 00:44:29,950
requires open swords actually and I know

00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:32,140
some code that I world in the security

00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:34,499
field is actually and as open source has

00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:39,279
actually been used by NSA for instance

00:44:34,499 --> 00:44:48,150
so open source they think passes muster

00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:54,210
yeah all right thank you force

00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:54,210
microscope spread your own each

00:44:54,730 --> 00:45:02,530
bring the drive

00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:04,900
so yeah I I think so I mean we've got

00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:07,150
loads of evidence that scratching your

00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:09,580
own edge doing the working on the things

00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:11,230
that motivates you either as an

00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:17,380
individual as a corporation is a huge

00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:22,510
driver for development so what's how am

00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:39,030
i doing on time few more questions let's

00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:42,910
do two more questions one at the back I

00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:44,860
think 96 ports is doing okay there's

00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:49,090
certainly been a lot of controversy over

00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:51,490
it I'm a big fan one of the boards in

00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:54,250
particular as very open and we've got

00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:56,980
the ability to do work on code right up

00:45:54,250 --> 00:46:01,420
into all of the secure layers of the ARM

00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:03,310
processor so that's that's the best the

00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:07,300
high silicon hey I don't work for linaro

00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:09,490
anymore so i can play favorites it's I'm

00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:12,070
a big fan of the wall way high silicon

00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:15,190
or a high keyboard because we've got

00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:17,920
access to all the security levels we can

00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:23,980
write code for secure l 2 we can write

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:28,870
code for l3 right up into so right from

00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:34,030
early boot and I believe we can even

00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:36,790
burn the fuses on that part so take a

00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:40,030
second and just tell us oh surely

00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:42,850
familiar what nice okay so 96 boards is

00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:45,310
a project that was started off by linaro

00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:47,200
one of the challenges that will narrow

00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:49,840
had right from when it started five

00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,990
years ago was they needed arm hardware

00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,610
to work on but every every arm silicon

00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:56,410
vendor came up with some different

00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:59,290
hardware that wasn't support very well

00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:01,450
so linaro came up with a specification

00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:03,910
for a couple of different types of board

00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:07,270
one is a credit card side credit

00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:09,920
card-sized consumer board another is an

00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:12,829
enterprise-class server board

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,990
and the specification had some minimum

00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:17,780
requirements on it had to have an open

00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:21,309
source colonel it had is on something

00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:23,809
either used by Android or mainline it

00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:25,730
had some requirements on on the

00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:26,869
bootloader and then these boards that

00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:29,930
have been made by several different

00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:32,000
vendors are being used for developing

00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:36,170
the arm ecosystem to do bring up to do

00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:39,440
support of of armed software all right i

00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:40,120
think i am at a time so thank you very

00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:45,610
much

00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:45,610
[Applause]
