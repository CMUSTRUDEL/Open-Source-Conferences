Title: FSOSS 2016: Internet of Everything
Publication date: 2016-11-24
Playlist: FSOSS 2016
Description: 
	Speaker: Peng (Ryan) Hu, Professor with Seneca College

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has been driven by the recent technological advancements and ecosystems meeting the vertical application requirements and market needs. An open IoT technology ecosystem has become increasingly important to industry players and the research community, which can keep the IoT technologies evolving for the years to come. This talk will first introduce several mainstream IoT ecosystems focused on battery-powered or battery-less smart connected devices enabled by industry consortia or research projects. The talk will also discuss a proposed framework behind these ecosystems together with the major business models, with the consideration of technical building blocks, market needs, and business vertical segments. Lastly, a case study showing how a technology ecosystem enabled by the successful AllJoyn software framework can support IoT industry will be given.

	00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:10,700
my topic is interim for everything so

00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:12,590
before I begin my talk I would I would

00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,799
ask I would like to ask a question how

00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,779
many we've actually developed some IOT

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:22,070
Protective Services or use some of the

00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:26,539
IOT gadgets and a home or at work just

00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:29,090
raise your hand okay we got few people

00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:31,910
have experienced the interval interval

00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:35,210
things so that's good for some people

00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,739
didn't have a chance to use or develop

00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,960
the internal things I think this is a

00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:40,820
kind of an introductory talk for you as

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,199
well do you understand what's going on

00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:48,080
on the market for for the platforms and

00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:51,140
and and all those technologies around so

00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,460
in terms of things actually so I would

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,140
like to give some introductions first

00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,799
before I focus on the technology

00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:00,589
ecosystem specifically so interpret

00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:03,470
things is actually happy have become a

00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:05,840
buzzword for quite a few years so you

00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,630
may be heard about in terms of things

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,020
specifically but also some related terms

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,520
just like internet of everything integer

00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,490
Internet of Things machine-to-machine

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,990
communication machine type of

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,320
communication something like that

00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:24,830
actually people make us believe that

00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:29,080
we're living in the area of inter for

00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:33,500
everything but part of that is true so I

00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:37,480
think it everything is just a point out

00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:41,960
from academia originally from RFID

00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:44,210
research community in back in 1999 there

00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:48,340
because there's one talk given by the

00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:51,020
director of the auto auto ID lab in MIT

00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:54,590
they just wanted to advertise or promote

00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:57,140
the use of active rfid technologies so

00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,930
that we can make things identifiable and

00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,880
make the transom make the process with

00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,850
monitoring more transparent something

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:08,119
like that but nowadays i think people

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:10,580
more and more you know get a more chance

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:12,740
to be exposed during everything's

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,680
products and services just one day we

00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,150
woke up and and realize that many of the

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,159
things actually around us

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,500
interpret things Burton services just

00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:24,319
like webcams started to be called

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,500
interim things stuff as well as our

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,840
connected fridges and kettles as well as

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,900
the wrist wrist bands to monitor our

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,510
heartbeats and blood pressure and some

00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,120
of the activities are start to be caught

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,129
in turn things protect the solutions I

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,659
think this causes some confusion so

00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:43,459
that's why every time I talk about in

00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:46,400
terms of things I wanted to make some

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:48,260
clarifications and also I remember the

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,480
one conversation I had was my colleague

00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,760
which is actually my boss he asked me

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,129
why we should call everything in terms

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,500
of things because he thought everything

00:02:55,129 --> 00:03:00,349
right now you know connected to the

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,069
Wi-Fi some other stuff those kind of

00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:07,129
gadgets we already can do that but why

00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:08,900
we should you know use some internal

00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:12,109
things technologies I think this really

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,849
good point that also explains some

00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,040
confusion among people about this

00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:17,569
concept and technologists and the

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,480
business people would like to use it as

00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:23,750
a turn to marketing their their part and

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,359
services and is really wise to make a

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,269
differentiation between the poster

00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:32,269
rationalized protect services for IOT

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:34,849
and the new protective services

00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:39,799
surrounding driven by OT technologies

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:41,599
and but admittedly even the web can

00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:46,430
Stoke webkinz we have to be used for

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:49,129
over like around 20 years have enjoying

00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,680
the enablement of IOT technologies for

00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:57,430
example we get a better image sensors on

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:59,900
the webkinz we get a more power saving

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:03,229
capability on the webkinz and got more

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,290
computing power on webkinz and get more

00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:09,139
available accessible design resources on

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,060
for the webcams for example so there are

00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:14,959
lots of things happening there are lots

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:21,859
of driving forces us around that kind of

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:23,150
a old today's technology so before

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:25,130
talking about anything else want to

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:28,550
share some of the one of my favorite

00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:30,980
favorite picture depicting the world of

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:33,680
internet for everything so this were

00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,690
this picture is kind of a crowded but it

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,090
describes a lot of these exciting

00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,410
applications that can be driven by an

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:43,130
interim for everything or in terms of

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:46,490
things so let's just a zoom in to see

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:52,100
some of these some of the examples right

00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:54,560
here so in this part we can see that we

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,630
can use some connected sensors digit

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,460
build on the bridge to monitor some

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,350
critical structure house information in

00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,140
order to know some real-time information

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:06,110
health information about the bridge in

00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:09,380
order to avoid some of the cata traffic

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,750
some accidents that could happen or to

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,980
improve some antennas of the bridge so

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,810
we can use internal things technology on

00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,590
the critical structures for structure

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:25,160
house monitoring so that's a typical

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:28,490
application and if we move kind of to

00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,980
the agricultural site we can have we can

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:33,520
deploy some sensors on the field in

00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:37,820
order to monitor some moisture and

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,580
humidity of the soil in order to improve

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,220
the process the corp management to

00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:47,240
practice the popular precision

00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:50,030
agriculture agriculture concept and also

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,190
we can deploy the sensors in a forest in

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,990
order to your voice on the wire far we

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,020
know some sets already happened in the

00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,700
memory but if you'd apply that you know

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:03,220
some of the sensors around in the forest

00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:07,430
you can maybe have a better better

00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:10,520
notification warning system before thumb

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,860
the disaster happens and another in

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,930
critical information of Internet of

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,600
Things is that we can deploy some of the

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:20,330
radiation sensors surround the

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,440
production line and surround the nuclear

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:27,680
power plants so so that we can avoid we

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,350
can monitor the what's going on whether

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,540
it's normal operation or not and also

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,990
voice some disaster that could happen

00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,100
some similar to the Fukushima disaster

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:41,840
several happening several years ago in

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:44,340
japan and if we move towards the city

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,169
site we can do a lot more entry

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,949
sting stuff more exciting stuff that

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:52,320
directly related to our lives so many

00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:54,810
people call that smart CD applications

00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,449
enabled by in terms of things so I just

00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,910
the point of some examples right here we

00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:02,699
can't deploy some sensors on the road or

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:06,360
surrounded the somebody at the road to

00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,850
detect some of the the accident we hate

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,350
that accident right that stuck if

00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,590
something happened on the road is just

00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:16,229
going to you know cause a lot of traffic

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:19,020
jams so we can deploy that sensors to

00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:21,240
give us a warning messages sent out to

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,130
the incoming trap incoming traffic so

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,040
we're better informed of what's going on

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:29,729
be in front of us and also we can deploy

00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,160
some of the sensors on the street lights

00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:33,510
in order to responds better to the

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,300
weather conditions and the Quillen

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:40,110
presence to say power or to make

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,419
intelligent decisions or two to be more

00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,130
response to the weather conditions so to

00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,350
make this thing smarter on the smart

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,470
street lighting applications and also we

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:51,389
can improve our environments in a city

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:54,690
in order if you can monitor some

00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:57,479
electronic magnetic radiations as well

00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:01,080
as the noise so we can do that all of

00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:08,700
kind all kinds of great applications to

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:11,220
make our life easier and better so

00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,099
that's the interim things applications

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,349
happen on the ground or on the water but

00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:19,620
I've like t-shirts another two typical

00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:21,240
examples which happens in the air the

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,180
first is in the air is called interv

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,050
lying things everybody knows how useful

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,900
a germ could be to help our lives

00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,279
especially when we heard the news about

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,919
using the drums to deliver some of the

00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:37,260
packages initiated by amazon what other

00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,419
big companies is quite useful for our

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,360
everyday life but drums can do a lot

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,279
more things the typical ones is just for

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,270
entertainment for most people to do

00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:50,940
arrow imaging to do the arrow selfie

00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:53,070
images and also they can do some land

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,780
management in the land surveying but

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:57,960
most importantly they can do something

00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:01,610
for critical tasks like

00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:04,020
search and rescue SAR applications and

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,600
because the single dome has some

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:09,230
limitations you may put a swaram Jones

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,390
on this guy they can do more things

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,910
collaboratively than they can they can

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,460
do individually so it can collaborate to

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:20,460
search in the region to make the mission

00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,010
faster and easier because of that

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,050
nowadays the Germans has really limit on

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,960
their battery they can only fly for like

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,460
20 minutes or 30 minutes right

00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,640
considering the Spirit is the 60 km/h

00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:35,040
they can only search in a region with

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,830
the radiance above 10 10 kilometers

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,320
around so if you put a lot of you know

00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,870
multiple drums together to collaborate

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,500
it accomplish some task we can do things

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:48,720
better and we can have better results

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,320
for that kind of regions a lot of things

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,900
can be done with a sworn of drums and

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,400
those drums can talk to each other or we

00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,230
can use internal things like

00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,030
communication particles to make them

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,330
talk to each other to make then relate

00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:05,430
information from one room to another and

00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,280
finally reach to our control station

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:11,850
with bit or ground base station to get

00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:14,850
some information from the field of

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:17,820
interest so that's the flying things in

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,640
turn or flying things and also where we

00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,740
just talked about macroscopic work this

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,270
is this is a concept of there is a

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,060
concept internet and nano things that

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,640
can happen in the microscopic world so

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:33,390
researchers point out the idea of using

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:38,850
the nano scale sensors they put in the

00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:41,280
body and monitors some of the diseases

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:44,100
that could never be this you know

00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:47,250
detected before or Kuna is really hard

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,230
to cure before and report it back the

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,690
information wirelessly to the base

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,910
station just a sitting on the desk and

00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,860
it can transmit back you know this

00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,630
information over Internet to the

00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:04,530
healthcare providers so that is actually

00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:06,930
make our life even healthier and and and

00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,090
very useful information useful

00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,840
information that it can be provided to

00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:14,790
the healthcare providers 22

00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,850
cure some diseases for example and it's

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,500
not just a fiction it happens is it's

00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,180
just an you know the technology that

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,070
will happen in the future because

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,440
there's some of the sensor technology

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:28,040
people have to make it a non-toxic and

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,300
make the robot more collaboratively

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,580
available if they put in your body

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,080
something like that some of the

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:37,200
technologies are still under development

00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,810
but it's a it's going to be a reality in

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,910
the future so that is actually part of

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:48,660
the interesting application as well in

00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:51,960
the microscopic domain so now I think it

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,240
is time to look the definition of

00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,220
internal things there are actually a lot

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,380
of definitions proposed by either

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,560
organization so consulting companies or

00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:04,980
were scholars but but luckily we have

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,290
some commonly accepted definitions i

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,560
would like to share the one I like most

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:13,830
so interesting is defined by Gartner is

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,660
the network of physical objects that

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,150
contain embedded technology to

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,070
communicate and sense or interact with

00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,930
their internal state or external

00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,900
environment I would like to point out

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:29,160
three key words here communicate sense

00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:31,470
or interact so that means we can put in

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,410
in other words any IOT system is

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:37,850
actually in bad assistant that should

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:40,920
have some words or wireless connectivity

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:43,740
modules as well as the sensors or

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,440
actuators in the sensors you know

00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,880
research community that call that

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,880
transducers but doesn't matter the same

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,310
thing you can describe the sensory or

00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:56,040
actuators together as a transducer so

00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:59,310
that's the definition it really captured

00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,440
all the features of IOT assistance we

00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,840
can see today so if you see any any

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,510
things that the company marketing the

00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,490
protein services that doesn't have this

00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:11,190
kind of a you know cannot be captured

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:17,760
this by this definition that's probably

00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:19,860
not a strictly defined IOT system so for

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,470
the three key words I would like to

00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,020
start with the sensors which is commonly

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,280
considers Batroc of IOT system I look

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,550
I know a lot of people think

00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,110
applications as bedrock of IOT system

00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:35,640
that's kind of true but it's actually

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:37,860
the fundamental technology is built upon

00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,750
the sensors technology so just select

00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,440
let's look at the one of the commonly

00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:47,310
used MEMS sensors which is micro electro

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,710
mechanical system sensors which is

00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:53,040
diverse cope it's actually available our

00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:57,900
phones on our VR assistance just a

00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:00,240
sensitive give us some orientation to

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:04,290
the unity bat assistance and how fast

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,360
it's involved every four years so we can

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:10,080
see that the dimension shows on the left

00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,700
of the of the slides is the gyroscope

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,610
the dye dimension which is a core part

00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:17,730
of that sensor is actually half the size

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:20,490
than that in four years ago and we can

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:23,880
put that small size of sensors into the

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,410
small embedded systems one is called the

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,720
soda cup of the typical examples for

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:30,480
those small embedded systems sensor

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:34,440
systems one is smart dust and another is

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:37,340
eco mode so they can they actually there

00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,900
they came out to demonstrate the

00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:43,620
miniaturizer size of innovative system

00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:46,890
how small it can be and that's just not

00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:49,100
the limit we can put all different kinds

00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:53,990
of smart does than equal modes together

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:57,180
to consist of a network of sensors

00:14:53,990 --> 00:15:00,180
either in star topology or matched

00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,520
apology or ad hoc topology so that they

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,760
can collaborate with each other exchange

00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:08,310
information and give us a sense

00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,740
distribute the sensing data and we can

00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,050
have those kind of data and massage it

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,000
and produce some it really useful

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:19,280
information that can never be done

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,580
before so that's the sensors technology

00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,960
can bring to the IOT citizens but i

00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:28,920
would like to also point out another

00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:31,260
side of IOT which is kind of which is

00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:35,160
the economic driver of royalty i would

00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:38,640
say nothing you know the well happened

00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,080
without economic driver the industry one

00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,880
not be interested too much about the

00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,120
technology there's no monetization

00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,710
process happened so that's why the

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,460
economic value is really important

00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:52,740
that's why the businesses are all put

00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,350
their products and services surrounding

00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,860
the introverted internet of things so I

00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:01,230
would like to share these figure just

00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:04,890
you know given us some projections of

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:06,450
connected devices by 2020 among all

00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:08,490
those big companies and consulting

00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:11,400
companies doesn't matter you probably

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:14,160
heard that the statement many years ago

00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,460
they're going to be 5050 billions of

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,650
connected devices by 2020 but

00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,660
unfortunately that figure was just

00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,310
adjusted by most of companies so we like

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,120
to share the latest of figures right now

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:30,120
but as still there is in the range of

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:33,450
tens of billions of devices let's still

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,640
huge number of connected devices you can

00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:38,910
generate a lot of benefits surrounding

00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:41,760
those devices themselves but also you

00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:44,130
can generate benefits from the

00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,890
surrounding services from those devices

00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:49,080
because the devices suggested there and

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,200
they're supposed to transmit some data

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:55,230
so that means we have to have some other

00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,570
devices on edge of the network like the

00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,250
edge computer at your router can collect

00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:01,650
those data intelligent legal processes

00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,500
that are locally before they sent to the

00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:06,839
cloud system and also we can have some

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:10,079
series of cloud services supporting

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:13,680
those data generated by those connected

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:18,060
devices as well as the applications we

00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:22,530
can put we can create it for those kind

00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:25,620
of data centric applications so a lot of

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:28,890
stuff can can be done surrounding the

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:31,680
connected devices so that's why I think

00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:34,710
it is very important for this 50 of IOT

00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,880
for the turn itself but also for the

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:42,240
enabling technology we're always

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:46,380
involving over time now I would like to

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,960
focus on the technology ecosystem so but

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,920
before doing that I would like to

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,200
differentiate between technology

00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,659
assistance and

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,730
the business ecosystem there are totally

00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:59,580
different actually the business

00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,409
ecosystems the more like equally the

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,539
supply chains distributors and customers

00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:05,490
and competitors some some sorts of the

00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:08,419
business stuff but I think the

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:11,909
technology ecosystems is some kind of a

00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:16,860
concept that have not been explored too

00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:19,740
much over time and is it is the

00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:22,799
phenomenon of the protagonist services

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,730
that we have seen on the IOT market is

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:29,399
so fragmented and we really need to have

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:31,860
some you know updated view on what's

00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:34,860
going on or came up with a theory each

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:38,250
one analyze what's going on on this

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:41,370
fragmented market of io TV ecosystem so

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:43,710
it's essentially technology ecosystems

00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,360
the product the platform is it it could

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,269
be hardware platform you could be

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,570
software platform doesn't matter it's

00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:53,039
generally defined and it can define by

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,470
the core components and all those

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,750
platforms can generate some of the

00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:00,029
complementary components supporting that

00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:04,740
platforms and hopefully all those

00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:07,019
efforts can also generate some economic

00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:11,789
values and to be connected to some

00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:13,799
business models so that's the technology

00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:16,019
ecosystem now we're looking at the IOT

00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:18,269
technology ecosystem I know it's really

00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:21,990
hard to define give a very clear

00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:24,000
definition of what a IOT ecosystem is

00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:27,330
but we like to point out some key

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,850
attributed attributes of this IOT

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:32,100
technology ecosystem so the first one I

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:35,309
would like to point out is it has to

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:39,210
support some system integration that

00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:43,380
means your platform standalone platform

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:45,090
is does not have much value before you

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,730
can put into other citizen to make them

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:49,230
work together and the second one is to

00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,230
support some hardware platform because

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,240
any software platform cannot leave

00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,710
without hard work and hardware platform

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,769
cannot leave without suffered but

00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:01,409
suffers basis just as we see how

00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:03,539
important the sensors is to the IOT

00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:06,060
applications and the third bullet points

00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:08,550
is it has to provide essential

00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,380
vitamin tools just in order for us

00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:15,360
developers and decision-makers

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:18,510
stakeholders in the IOT solutions can do

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,950
something out of the technology and also

00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,680
it has to support some connectivity

00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:25,200
technologies what I mean by connecting

00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:28,530
technologies is that specifically for

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,510
example any platform should not only

00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,280
support some ethernet technology like

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,260
gigabit ethernet technology but also

00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:39,650
some wireless technology connective

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:43,740
technology like Wi-Fi like other

00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:45,990
low-power wireless connectivity modules

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,120
as well so it really depends on

00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,820
applications you want to or some target

00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,520
sectors wanna I want to put your product

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:57,060
and services in and that the last one it

00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:01,140
has two is to support a business model

00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:03,180
because any ecosystem are there in order

00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:06,570
to complete some mission it has to

00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:09,270
generate some of values in a radiation

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:13,200
chin no matter its value economic value

00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:15,480
or some impact on the open source

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,750
community for example that's is that

00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,370
actually part of the business model

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:25,830
surrounding a ending IOT technology

00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:29,520
ecosystem and next is the natural

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:31,890
question we can raise about IOT

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,970
technological assistance what's defines

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:37,800
a good io t equals technology ecosystem

00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,840
so based on the previous slides it has

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:43,050
to be very easy to integrate into the

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,230
existing and hopefully future systems

00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:48,300
and also it has to support various

00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:50,040
headwear platform that means if you only

00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,260
support android platform for example

00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,290
insperity support iOS platforms as well

00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,630
and there are many of them ARM arm based

00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:01,170
platforms available as well in embedded

00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:03,450
system world and it also has two easy to

00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:07,380
use in terms of development tools and

00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:09,270
and and other tools in order to speed up

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,810
the time to market that's very essential

00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:14,520
to any businesses and I also it has to

00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:19,040
support of various connectivity

00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:22,970
technologies so nowadays any

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:25,340
0like radio module that only they don't

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:28,190
you know only support one to

00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:31,040
connectivity technology but also up but

00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:33,950
also they support multiple of them like

00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,170
i will give example the later on and it

00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,970
also it has to support have to have a

00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,010
good number of users i know it's really

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,230
related to the business model because

00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:44,360
for any successful business model it

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:46,490
turns out we have good number of users

00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,230
but the number of users is important no

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:51,440
matter is commercial users or

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,600
open-source community users doesn't

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:58,450
matter that's something keep the

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,450
technology ecosystem alive and evolving

00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:06,560
so that's the iot technology ecosystem

00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:09,500
but also i think it's really hard to

00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,720
talk about everything surrounding iot

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,800
technology goes in so i would like to

00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:18,980
narrow down to the low power IOT

00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:21,530
technology ecosystems because low power

00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:26,080
is no matter or not you realize it or

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:30,380
not low-power IOT is very important to

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,570
the IOT embedded systems every examples

00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,700
that show you before in the world of

00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:37,670
inter for everything can be realized by

00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:42,380
the low-power IOT embedded systems so

00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:44,300
it's important for for the IOT and to

00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,240
understand that what's a low-power IOT

00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,940
is actually is based on the low power on

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,760
hopefully low-cost application and also

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,190
it has to have low power standardized of

00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,740
radio modules the research a lot of

00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:00,650
research shows that the power

00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:03,170
consumption of the IOT equal team bad

00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:05,660
assistance is actually depending on the

00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,100
radio modules so if you can turn off the

00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:10,520
radio module most of the time you save a

00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:13,250
lot of power on the IOT battle system so

00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,160
that's why is the dominant factor for

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:20,150
any low-power io t equals embedded

00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:24,080
system so i would like to just the list

00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:27,830
some very popular standardized low-power

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,870
radio technologies right here the first

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,650
one is the bluetooth which is actually

00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,510
based on the layer 1 layer 2

00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:38,580
nology to find by I to Bowie is called I

00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:41,040
oh wao 2015 21 and Wi-Fi halo is a new

00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:45,090
initiative is a new amendments to the

00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:48,870
Wi-Fi standards it is called officially

00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:50,220
called actually able to dot11 aah and

00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,020
it's think it is what you do well be

00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,140
available by the end of this year or

00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:58,490
early next year I mean the manufacturer

00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:02,160
will put some of the fabrication of the

00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:04,230
Wi-Fi halo compliant chips maybe early

00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,330
next year or late next year because the

00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:11,160
standardization is not yet officially

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:14,520
finished but it has a role in an

00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:17,640
emission to play a part in the low-power

00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:20,520
IOT world and the third one is kind of

00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,470
very popular one it's been there for

00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:27,900
many years it's the technology build

00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:31,290
upon i HEA oh 2 dot 15 dot 4 so the the

00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:34,800
margins of that technology build upon

00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:38,310
that include that zigbee 6lowpan 60

00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,530
worries heart and is a 111 a there are

00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:42,690
just targeting different market tipton

00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:45,360
markets and different integer sectors

00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,610
but underlying technology is actually

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,320
defined by I troop arrow 2052 for which

00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:52,620
is a working group defining the layer

00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:57,600
one layer two technologies in I Triple E

00:25:52,620 --> 00:26:00,240
and there there there are few more one

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,050
is that z-wave is butyl on the radio

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,500
technologies standardized by itu-t itu

00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:08,640
is actually is the International

00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,190
Telecommunication unit is their

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,480
organization under the management of

00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:17,330
United Nations so it's kind of a

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,640
international standards so the z-wave

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,930
technologists build upon this

00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,670
international standards which is also

00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:27,150
can be considered as open standard in

00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:32,460
the communication and the Dutch seven is

00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:36,000
also open standard standardized radio

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:39,270
technology the Dutch seven is actually

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,570
came from the the active rfid

00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:44,970
technologies in order to they want to I

00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:49,730
put a dash 7 tag

00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:54,090
to the industry automation applications

00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:58,289
but in 2013 they just be purpose in

00:26:54,090 --> 00:27:00,780
itself to do something more not only in

00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:03,120
just the integer automation but also

00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:08,460
smart energies and advertising so all

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:14,730
sorts of applications and also another

00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:16,620
one is LTE MTC which is there for long

00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:20,940
term evolution machine-type

00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:24,750
communication I think most of you have

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:28,799
have used some LT LT mobile phones right

00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:30,539
so actually if you know the 4g system is

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,429
actually based on outie advance the

00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:34,919
standard so LT is a very complex a

00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:39,299
standard set and the one of the

00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:42,900
standards is for in terms of things

00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:45,419
communications so the organization

00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:48,120
behind it LT wants to make sure they can

00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:50,400
utilize the infrastructure of LTE to

00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,370
served IOT communications which is low

00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,750
cost the low-speed somehow for

00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,539
machine-to-machine communications so

00:27:54,750 --> 00:28:01,470
that's why it's called generally LG MTC

00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:04,230
and another popular gradually popular in

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,090
a technology related to that to provide

00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,730
a long-range communication for I OTS

00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:12,000
low-power I 18 batt assistances it's

00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:15,960
called a narrowband IOT and several

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,159
examples are several technique o systems

00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:23,190
are built upon that one is Laura and

00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:25,350
other is witless and and I think it

00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,299
another successful example is a cig Fox

00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,340
you've probably heard that in the news

00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:30,929
they deploy some of the IOT

00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,360
infrastructure in the Europe quite

00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:36,659
successfully but all those technologies

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,860
lower bit ly so sick Fox are actually

00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:43,169
have the same type of communication

00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:47,490
standards which conforms to the

00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:49,500
narrowband IOT and lt also has another

00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:53,640
string of discussing how they can put

00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:56,490
lt's admini means in order to fit that

00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,040
never been iot which consume the less

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:05,670
you know less power than then

00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:08,450
te MTC and catagory a machine that kind

00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:10,710
of a type of the mobile assistance so

00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:13,380
we've talked about a lot of radio

00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,750
technologies I think before I just dive

00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,940
into some of the models of all those

00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:21,750
technologies follow I would like to

00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:24,030
propose the framework which is that can

00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:28,380
be used to describe the low-power IOT

00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:31,310
technology ecosystems so there is

00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:35,010
actually a cubic view of all those

00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:37,350
consisting of technology IOT building

00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:39,390
blocks as well as the vertical business

00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,910
segments as well as the market amounts

00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:44,040
and business models so what I would like

00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:48,360
to start with the the front wheel of

00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:51,560
this framework right from the bottom so

00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,730
we can see that open standards is very

00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,670
important building blocks and actually

00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:59,430
it has a lot of standards defining the

00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:01,440
sensors operation the sensor standards

00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:04,620
how to match for manufacture the sensors

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,450
and in the face from one sensor to

00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,760
another sensor for example and around

00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:10,770
one sensor to the mainboard those kind

00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:15,780
of things and also the open standards

00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:17,420
for cysts integration standards and also

00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:22,440
some bunch of standards for

00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:24,060
interoperability between the devices one

00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,890
example is that how to make sure

00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,780
different devices running different

00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,660
upper stings of something they can talk

00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:32,510
to each other so that's let's plan

00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:36,930
student interoperation standards and

00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:39,120
right about that most of time without

00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:41,010
built our embedded systems with some

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,650
protocol stacks because we're talking

00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:45,390
about a communication most most of the

00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,680
times wireless communication for i/o

00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,680
team bad assistance that's the most

00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,970
popular option for that and we have to

00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,210
use some protocol stack is there is

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:56,640
tcp/ip protocol or other particle build

00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,470
upon some glue tues ZBZ way but I talked

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,380
about before we have to use some

00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,960
protocol stacks and we also have to use

00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,400
some hardware components as well as the

00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,160
sum of the libraries it can make things

00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:12,150
work so I call that hardware platform

00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,720
and also we should follow some of the

00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,700
software

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,840
work no matter so very simple one on

00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:22,980
complex one that join different

00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:24,600
components together in order to put in

00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:28,559
order to allow us to create some of the

00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,960
IOT apps to do something and all the

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:34,440
apps doesn't matter what kind of app is

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,780
is it has to provide some the data to

00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,960
the higher-level application the

00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:42,360
business logics so its relates you a lot

00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,490
of business surrounding that the

00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,530
particle stacks and apps the creation is

00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:49,470
related to software service business and

00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:51,570
the data connectivity that means how we

00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,760
transmit data from one device to another

00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:56,309
or from one device to the cloud center

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,860
is actually brought by the internet

00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:03,299
service business so you probably have

00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:05,700
have seen that there is service provider

00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:08,850
by Rogers provide you're the smart home

00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:11,640
and it caught that they call that in

00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:13,620
terms of things parting the services so

00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,900
that's that's kind of surveys I'm

00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:18,419
talking about and also we have data

00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:22,350
service business that means we take care

00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:24,510
of the sensor data from individual

00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,700
devices or front a bunch of devices

00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,140
connected together and we have to do

00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,650
something out of that to do some

00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:33,809
analysis to do some storage to visualize

00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:36,240
those data so that's the service

00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:38,640
provided by data service business

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,770
providers and we have cloud service

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,610
business I think that's quite of one

00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:48,030
kind of typical business for example we

00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:50,820
have Amazon AWS IOT that's just the one

00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:53,190
of the new are you know part of offering

00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:56,280
since last year i believe and also the

00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:59,220
IBM bluemix they're all built upon the

00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:02,490
IOT solutions in terms of cloud service

00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:04,110
business and we have also application

00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,400
solution business that means put things

00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:07,230
together I don't care about which

00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,940
technology we're going to use we care

00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,799
about what kind of a solution it can

00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,059
provide for example the water monitoring

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:17,820
for example how to monitor the radio

00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:19,350
radio levels on the nuclear power plant

00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,919
something like that or on the production

00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:24,899
line so they provide that application

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,980
specific solution to do some business

00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:27,120
surrounding that

00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,660
so that's the application solution

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,940
business been talking about and

00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:35,179
cybersecurity is very important separate

00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:38,850
security can relate all those components

00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:42,350
I you've seen that in IOT building

00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:46,020
blocks so last Friday just one week ago

00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:49,049
we probably heard that the Internet

00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:51,630
services where bro were brought down on

00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:57,710
on the twitter on netflix right and

00:33:51,630 --> 00:34:00,480
that's actually from the DDoS attacks

00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:04,830
from the malicious attackers they're

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:08,250
taking their using a lot of hacked IOT

00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:10,320
appliances so you're connecting the

00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:13,409
cattle you're connected fridges can be

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,540
or connected webkinz can be take you

00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:17,879
know taking advantage II to initiate

00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,710
such kind of DDoS attack to bring the

00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:22,470
service down details attack is very

00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:25,139
simple to to initiate but it has to use

00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:27,929
that some botnet to do that so I would

00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:30,450
he appliances where I OT gadgets are now

00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:33,240
become the target so we're not aware of

00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:35,070
what's happening on our our G guard yet

00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,020
so that's the one example typical

00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:40,139
examples if you look in the show then I

00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,720
think some people maybe have have look

00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:45,210
at that before they're exposed on my

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:49,350
internet connected devices which is also

00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:51,990
part of the IOT devices that can be

00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:54,570
easily hacked so there's some some of

00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:57,210
the website showing all those devices

00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:59,790
and hackers can take advantage of those

00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:02,010
information and put that in botnet to do

00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:04,350
some of the DDoS attacks so that's just

00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:07,530
one example there are many other things

00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:10,940
we have to concur taking care of but

00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:16,470
don't be panic because i believe the

00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:18,210
leanest Torre's the statements that we

00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,619
have to build something first before we

00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,420
take care you know think about the

00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:23,460
security of out of that and there's

00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,350
actually if you follow some of the best

00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,930
practice of a security everything can be

00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:29,609
protected in a reasonable scare so

00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:31,920
that's a cyber security business and

00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:33,600
also we have some traditional businesses

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,670
like manufacturing manufacturing the

00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,559
headwear of the platform manufacturing

00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:41,930
the chips manufacturing these circuits

00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:44,509
you design so although things and also

00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:46,609
the system integrators are based on

00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:49,819
those hardware components all those kind

00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:52,609
of a traditional businesses and also all

00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:54,259
those pieces have to survive in order to

00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:56,239
they should have a successful business

00:35:54,259 --> 00:35:58,189
model that's the front view tells us and

00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:01,099
also it has to follow the market mounts

00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:03,349
that's the right view tells us so I

00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:06,609
think it is given some fair amount of

00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:09,469
views on what we should consider

00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:11,630
surrounding the technical building

00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:16,910
blocks of IOT as well as some business

00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:21,709
considerations surrounding that so I

00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:24,890
would like to show in kind of a picture

00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:28,339
ristic way of what we have for IOT

00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:32,509
technology ecosystems so we can see a

00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:35,989
lot of brands and big names attached to

00:36:32,509 --> 00:36:38,839
some of the ecosystems sitting there so

00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:42,170
let's just look at the I owed on the top

00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:45,769
of these of these slides so we have iotv

00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:47,599
we have all join so those are two kind

00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:52,279
of a Linux Foundation management project

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:55,699
which is under the open connectivity

00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:57,650
foundations management and all join was

00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:59,959
initiated by Austin Alliance and it's

00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:03,170
just the recently merged dude open

00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:05,449
connectivity foundation on october 10th

00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,859
just this this month but still i just

00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:08,599
put in the logo there for the

00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:11,630
perspective the creation of the all

00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:13,939
joint project and it's all open source

00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:17,239
and i would sively and all join can

00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:19,069
actually that it's open source they're

00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:21,589
open source project providing some

00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:24,439
communication protocols providing some

00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:26,839
of the software frameworks that can make

00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:28,789
your development of the IOT embedded

00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:31,299
system easier so if I talk about that

00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:34,609
later and we have the brillo and weave

00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:38,209
released by google officially this year

00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:40,459
to provide some easy to use development

00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:41,749
process build upon their brillo

00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:44,420
operating systems and we've

00:37:41,749 --> 00:37:46,670
communication protocol framework to for

00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:51,339
the Alice's but it's mainly targeted for

00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:54,249
like and Roy and other linux-based

00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:57,380
operating systems

00:37:54,249 --> 00:38:00,259
and we have LT that's just what I talked

00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:02,479
about before and and ellora sig Fox and

00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:06,380
waitlist web talk about and on the right

00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:09,109
side we have all those the complete list

00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:11,989
of those technology ecosystems like the

00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:13,339
wireless heart is the 100 a which are

00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:17,059
actually targeting the manufacturing

00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:19,359
automation system they have developed

00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:21,979
some particles to ensure the reliability

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:25,099
that it can never be easily be done by

00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:26,509
just the you know for the ecosystem for

00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:27,829
the communication protocols build upon

00:38:26,509 --> 00:38:31,099
some for the home automation

00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:32,509
applications like the ZB or Z wait but

00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:34,909
it's still they they have a fair amount

00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:36,429
of the reliability for sure so they had

00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:42,380
definitely basically they have different

00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:44,149
target industry sectors but I want to

00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:47,779
point out three things right here I

00:38:44,149 --> 00:38:54,139
didn't introduce before one is in ocean

00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:57,109
which is actually is for the automation

00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:59,719
system that is built upon the the energy

00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:01,909
harvesting technologies because they're

00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:03,559
a bunch of sensor-based Adam an embedded

00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:07,419
device it doesn't need a lot of battery

00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:10,069
that Justin need is some simple you know

00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:12,109
simple scenario just transmitted you

00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:14,539
know one chunk of information to the

00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:17,449
base station and that's it so that's

00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:19,549
something we can be done by using the

00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:21,799
energy happening technologies even the

00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:24,579
we're at the the energy a visiting

00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:27,649
sources could be initiated by the

00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:30,249
mechanical movements or you can be

00:39:27,649 --> 00:39:36,559
initiated by some of the paramedical

00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:38,929
sort of chemical reactions and contiki

00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,119
and the riot are actually two popular

00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:42,739
operating system nowadays especially for

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,659
in the research community they're

00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:48,769
totally open source but actually they're

00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:51,319
not created by some instrum entry

00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:54,709
players they're created by some of the

00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:57,979
academics so they're sitting there they

00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:59,389
can they can actually do a lot of things

00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:01,579
we can actually do a lot of things based

00:39:59,389 --> 00:40:02,929
on a simulation tools and and operating

00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:05,209
system and the supported headwear

00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:07,280
platform supported by it that and the

00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:08,900
riot is a real time

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,960
operating system because we don't have a

00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:14,960
real-time operating system just for IOT

00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,720
before so somebody created a riot for

00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,730
that kind of a niche market and of

00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,130
course they have some commercial users

00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:25,730
we can do a lot of things based on those

00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:28,760
two projects and two ecosystems created

00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:32,990
by them and another one is armed and bad

00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:35,900
and RM bed is a arm-based ecosystem that

00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:37,550
is similar to Raspberry Pi but I

00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,820
wouldn't put that analogy because

00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:42,740
there's still some differences arm embed

00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:46,250
is actually very targeted to the

00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:48,710
low-power cortex-m technology based

00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:51,170
platforms and they provide a nun only

00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:56,180
operating system but also the cloud

00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:58,730
services and also some of the IPS for

00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:02,960
the manufacturers and for developers so

00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:05,360
that's the thing and then I think I

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,270
should categorize what's the kind of a

00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:11,240
models that's actually working for those

00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:13,550
IOT low-power IOT technology ecosystems

00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,860
I would like to propose for models right

00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:17,840
here the first one is semiconductor to

00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,970
remodel and the second one is data

00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,740
service to air model and third one is

00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,630
vertical application driven model and

00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:30,010
the last one is framework to remodel

00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:30,010
I've talked about one by one oops

00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:41,730
okay take some time so the first one is

00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:45,210
Tecna semiconductor dreamer model this

00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:47,099
actually this model any ecosystem

00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:49,740
following this model provides a platform

00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:53,549
driven by semiconductor related

00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:57,029
industries for example if we use some of

00:41:53,549 --> 00:42:00,029
the the chip like arm-based chip the

00:41:57,029 --> 00:42:01,859
manufacturer of that ship will provide

00:42:00,029 --> 00:42:04,470
some libraries software libraries and

00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:06,210
also development tools as well as

00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:09,299
another tools related to that to make

00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:12,029
our development easier for the the

00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:14,009
target users could be developers and

00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:16,529
system integrators for that so this is a

00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:20,599
traditional model I would say and a lot

00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:20,599
of ecosystems follow this model

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,950
um like the bluetooth sig be Wi-Fi halo

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,990
actually believe it or not they're

00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:37,120
following the semiconductor to remodel

00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:42,520
because any of those tech echo system

00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:46,600
cannot exist without any headwear chip

00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:48,670
so it has to have some headwear chips to

00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:51,400
support those particles especially their

00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:54,730
communication particles running some of

00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:57,850
the needs some support of layer 1 layer

00:42:54,730 --> 00:43:00,550
two algorithms following the seven-layer

00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:02,650
OSI model and they have some common

00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:06,370
features the first one of like to point

00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:09,100
us is they we should have some headway

00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:11,260
fabrication support for this model and

00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,270
we should have some chip level IP cores

00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,820
for the model as well as a board level

00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:19,750
support so that just like let's look at

00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:23,560
some of the just one example from from

00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:25,300
arm so we arm just released I think

00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:30,250
recently released the cordial radio IP

00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:37,210
which is a design of you know of for for

00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:39,010
some of the radio module chip and they

00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:42,640
can support Bluetooth you can support

00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:46,240
threat they can support zigbee it's just

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:48,430
an out a couple of days before league be

00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,710
alliance just a now make announcement

00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:54,040
that it have collaboration with arm to

00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:57,310
make sure they can the radio a cordial

00:43:54,040 --> 00:44:01,090
radio IP can include ZB 3.0 standards

00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:03,610
and build upon that we can have some

00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:05,440
boards headwear boards and we can have

00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:07,570
some operating systems support that

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,450
boards and we can have some applications

00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:12,490
working with that had web platform so

00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:16,060
this actually captures some of the

00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:18,490
features of the technology ecosystem we

00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:20,290
should have some hack work or we should

00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:22,270
have some software stack and open stance

00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:26,290
as well as the application profiles in

00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:29,770
order to make everything work subsidy

00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:32,800
for every kind of applications so that's

00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:34,420
the application profiles and I would

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,760
like to talk about second model which is

00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,470
data service to your model which is kind

00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,450
of straightforward as I talked about

00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:42,970
when I before

00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:46,420
a purist slide this model is actually

00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:49,359
for the platform's targeting at

00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:52,270
providing the service for the data

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:54,900
security for the data messaging and

00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:59,260
storage as well as visualization

00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:01,450
analytics as well as the schema so they

00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:06,070
can provide all those services build

00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:11,290
upon the sensing data some typical

00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:14,020
examples are amazon awti OT IBM bluemix

00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:17,170
google cloud platform if this and that

00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:19,930
ft dt and think speak so there's some

00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:21,730
couple of small players sitting there i

00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:24,280
just want to point out that we shouldn't

00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:26,500
you know that and they have some common

00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,990
features like they they provide all kind

00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:31,839
of cloud-based data services and they

00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:33,640
provide some connectivity connector AP

00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,950
is in order to better you know

00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,900
integrated to our any software platforms

00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:43,300
and the provides with data management

00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:45,130
functions so the third one is really

00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:47,050
easy to understand its vertical

00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:50,500
application driven model that means the

00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:56,319
ecosystem itself has to serve some the

00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:59,140
specific application domains the common

00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:01,450
features include that it has to have

00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,369
some target interview sector and it has

00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:06,069
to have some established market share of

00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:10,030
that sector and it has to support some

00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:14,020
hardware software platforms also support

00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:17,020
for product that certification and some

00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:20,880
examples include the wordage heart is a

00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:24,099
111 a which are subsidy target at

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:28,000
manufacturing automation systems and the

00:46:24,099 --> 00:46:30,430
dutch 77 targeting some kind of building

00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,970
automation system smarter energy smart

00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:36,520
homes and automotive systems something

00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:40,180
like brett like that and all join thread

00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:43,589
ZB bluetooth or actually have our target

00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:46,930
market for home automation systems and

00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:49,450
the z-wave in ocean targeted industry

00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:52,060
automation systems and and this is just

00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:53,710
one technology that invented many years

00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:56,740
ago is for the health care

00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:58,780
assistance which is used by garment like

00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:03,750
the smart wristbands right nowadays

00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:08,680
they're using partially of using the and

00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:11,320
technology so the last one is framework

00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:15,099
driven model so the frame remodel is

00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:19,859
about to provide the software frameworks

00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:22,690
for an IOT system I think it is a smart

00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:25,630
strategy if any tech technology

00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:28,000
ecosystem using this model because it's

00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:30,730
supposed to be headwear platform

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,680
agnostic it provides some framework

00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:35,200
doesn't matter what kind of hat where

00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,180
you are using they can all you know

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,420
we're together by using the software

00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:45,690
firmware provided by the by those

00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:48,700
players but those play by those example

00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:51,640
framework software framework players and

00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:54,369
it has to support some on the SDK and

00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,720
the tools and also it support some

00:47:54,369 --> 00:48:01,320
business ecosystem so some examples

00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:04,270
right here are oh John thread reload

00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:08,109
plus we've as well as contiki in the

00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:10,180
right so some are most of them are

00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:11,800
initiated by the companies but a cup of

00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:14,920
them like antiquing the right and issued

00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:17,740
by need by the research community but as

00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:20,260
still they can serve a lot of things for

00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:23,589
the commercial purposes for out cheaper

00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:28,119
product and services so i would like to

00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:30,730
point out one framework for you is the

00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:32,530
old joint framework which is you know

00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:36,420
currently considered as kind of a

00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:40,240
successful successful front work

00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:42,220
existing nowadays so the definition your

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,830
description of the old joins actually

00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:46,990
open source software framework that can

00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:49,030
make things make the make it easier for

00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:53,950
devices and apps to discover and

00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:58,270
communicate with each other and also it

00:48:53,950 --> 00:49:00,010
has it is actually had were agnostic so

00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:01,570
it doesn't matter what kind of transport

00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,760
layer what kind of radio technologies

00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:04,950
you are using what kind of a

00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,360
manufacturer of the trip you are using

00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:10,060
they can all work together where

00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:13,470
too suffered you know framework provide

00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:16,660
a authorized software framework and also

00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:18,730
the author and firm work as a summarized

00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,190
before is actually follows a couple of

00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:23,800
models that proposed one is vertical

00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:26,260
application because it's targeting home

00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:28,870
automation systems and also these friend

00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:31,090
with curvy models and it actually

00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:33,420
connects to all your sensual elements in

00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:38,080
the proposal framework that show you

00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:39,850
before you can generate a lot of you

00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:43,390
know opportunities for related business

00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:45,010
by using this framework so I would like

00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:46,750
I would like to show you the framework

00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:50,140
itself you know in high level

00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:53,350
architecture it's so this is the adjoint

00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:56,440
software framework you know in a block

00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:59,470
diagram we can have for example for any

00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:01,960
IOT low-power IOT ecosystem technology

00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:04,300
ecosystem we have some physical layer no

00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:07,090
matter its Wi-Fi no matter is zigbee no

00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:09,520
Mary's Ethernet bluetooth is the fiscal

00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:11,440
year stuff and we have operating system

00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:15,430
it could be a Linux it could be other

00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:18,460
just real-time operating systems and but

00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:21,190
above that is the software framework

00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:23,620
provides you so we have the core library

00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:26,590
supporting all those essential functions

00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:32,050
like the discovery and advertising of

00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:35,290
the other devices as well as the connect

00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:37,570
connection AP is and and also the

00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:39,370
security API is for example it can be

00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:43,240
very useful to secure our data

00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:45,880
transmission and we have the router and

00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:48,220
the Gateway support and in terms of

00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:51,840
software to provide a different rows in

00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:54,790
the architecture of the IOT network and

00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:56,740
about that we have service framework

00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:59,500
providing the you know targeting

00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:01,900
different applications you know capture

00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:04,030
the sentra capture the essential

00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:07,230
services used by different applications

00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:10,600
for example onboarding control panel and

00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:13,540
localization and those and as well as

00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:16,300
lightning service framework so we can

00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:20,400
build upon those modules in the service

00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:20,400
framework to do some applications

00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:26,650
and if you put everything together for

00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:29,549
example all the gadgets running the

00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:32,890
audio and firm work enabled application

00:51:29,549 --> 00:51:34,779
we can put make them talk to each other

00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:36,219
they can understand each other with no

00:51:34,779 --> 00:51:39,969
problem can use one app to control

00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:42,009
everything ideally you know with our

00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:44,859
foam and they can transmit all those

00:51:42,009 --> 00:51:50,140
things to the cloud or to another

00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:52,329
machine which is far far far far from

00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:59,049
the control center so can use the

00:51:52,329 --> 00:52:02,049
Gateway to do that to summarize we have

00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:05,469
talked about the inter for everything

00:52:02,049 --> 00:52:08,170
technology ecosystem and we talked about

00:52:05,469 --> 00:52:12,609
the conceptual framework that can help

00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:15,269
us understand the different things from

00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:21,069
business perspective and from technology

00:52:15,269 --> 00:52:24,489
perspective and we can have better

00:52:21,069 --> 00:52:28,079
understanding by analyzing what's the

00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:31,299
behind what's the principles working on

00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:34,390
the fragmented technology ecosystems by

00:52:31,299 --> 00:52:40,390
using the 44 models are proposed and

00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:43,180
also we can have a we can say that any

00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:45,279
technology ecosystem does not have to

00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:47,529
follow just the one model but also to

00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:49,509
follow multiple models because it's

00:52:47,529 --> 00:52:53,009
possible that's why I put some there's

00:52:49,509 --> 00:52:56,559
some overlaps between the models and the

00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:58,719
foremost is the main models from my

00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:02,619
observation but it might be other models

00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:04,799
existing for because we are talking

00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:08,349
about a broad spectrum of IOT businesses

00:53:04,799 --> 00:53:10,440
so that's all for my talk thanks very

00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:10,440
much

00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:13,610
you

00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,640
