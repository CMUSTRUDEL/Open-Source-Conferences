In today's world where applications are born and die within just a few years, how can you make your app stand out, stay relevant, and reach a wider audience? Although designing applications that are not accessible is illegal (unless in a private or not-for profit organization with less than 50 employees), we are seldom taught the how-to's in school or the workplace. Having the tools and skills to achieve this will make you an indispensable asset to any development team. We'll be referencing WAI-ARIA techniques, which describes the standards for implementing inclusive design.
