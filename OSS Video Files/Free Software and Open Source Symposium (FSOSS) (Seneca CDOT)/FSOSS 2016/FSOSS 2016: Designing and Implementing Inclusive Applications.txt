Title: FSOSS 2016: Designing and Implementing Inclusive Applications
Publication date: 2016-11-25
Playlist: FSOSS 2016
Description: 
	Speakers: Matthew Marangoni and Laily Ajellu, Research Assistants with Seneca CDOT

In today's world where applications are born and die within just a few years, how can you make your app stand out, stay relevant, and reach a wider audience? Although designing applications that are not accessible is illegal (unless in a private or not-for profit organization with less than 50 employees), we are seldom taught the how-to's in school or the workplace. Having the tools and skills to achieve this will make you an indispensable asset to any development team. We'll be referencing WAI-ARIA techniques, which describes the standards for implementing inclusive design.

welcome to this presentation about

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,889
inclusive design while your learn how to

00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:12,690
design and implement inclusive

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:16,500
applications that everyone in the world

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,510
will be able to use first Matthew will

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,040
be contextualizing the problem and tell

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,890
you about the infrastructure in place

00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,470
the hardware software and some tools and

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,119
tips about how to get started then I'm

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,550
going to be diving into the seven-step

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,859
checklist a checklist of things that you

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,690
can do to make your application

00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:38,970
inclusive and legally so by the

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,650
government of Ontario so our purpose

00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,989
here is to bring awareness to inclusive

00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,640
design to give you all the introduction

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,830
to implementing inclusive sign in your

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,030
applications web sites and also to make

00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,379
it easier for developers to create

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:55,799
inclusive applications so just a quick

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,449
accessibility overview meet coming from

00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:59,670
an architectural background the same way

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,769
an architect designs they're building to

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,989
be accessible for all users web content

00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:06,690
we create has developers must also be

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,790
accessible for everyone in essence as

00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,729
developers we are the architects of the

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,720
Internet so not only is it unethical for

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,799
you

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,420
applications and websites that are not

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,700
accessible for all users but it comes to

00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,549
be unlawful if you're a company with

00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:26,409
over 50 employees you can find it you're

00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:29,080
documenting i'm going to go where first

00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:31,000
a few hardware needs to technologies the

00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,740
first one on the list of being

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,909
alternative keyboards so these can be

00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,470
keyboards that either just have a

00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:37,780
different keyboard layout than the

00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:41,049
standard or have larger keys or smaller

00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,479
keys these help of users who have built

00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:45,640
impressing certain regular sized key

00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,830
points the next thing we have our

00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,360
electronic pointing devices so in the

00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,640
picture here you see Stephen Hawking

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,060
he's got an infrared laser mounted to

00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,789
his eyeglasses and that's his form of a

00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,619
genius computer next we have the sip and

00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:01,330
puff system which you can see in the

00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,819
diagram of the girl put the straw

00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,869
connected to remote and this works by

00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:06,550
either sitting and puffing through the

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:08,319
straw or moving your lips around the

00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,810
straw and that's how they interact with

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,640
their computer there next we have

00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,950
trackballs trackpads on touchscreens

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,019
these are things that every user

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,590
Connolly's today their smartphone tablet

00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:22,510
even desktop and finally we have a

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,829
Braille display so these are the blind

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,640
teachers they can't see what's on the

00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:29,380
screen obviously so what will happen is

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,430
the Braille display will transcribe the

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,099
information as

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:38,049
GRL text didn't feel plus being shown

00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:38,950
and they can respond accordingly next to

00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:40,959
go through a few software-based

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,010
assistive technologies so these kegs

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,709
inside there at the operating system

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,480
level or the application level the first

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,969
one being white signaler alerts so this

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,159
would be for a diffuser if there's some

00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:52,510
kind of action or sound that's played to

00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:54,400
notify the user that something's

00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,900
happening what will happen is that is

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,629
the screen will flash to them to let

00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,150
them know that they need to do something

00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:02,409
next we have on-screen keyboards this is

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,379
for somebody who has difficulty typing

00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:08,859
we use a mouse or touch screen or

00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:11,739
something like that and we use this

00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:13,930
calmly in our phones today mostly but

00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:17,230
it's also available on most pcs it not

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,359
all of them and what these come bundled

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,079
with autocorrect working prediction as

00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:25,349
well so these are things that they're

00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:28,000
making everyone's life kind of easier

00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:30,040
autocorrect even exists in word

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,889
processing applications and it really

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,019
speeds up the flow of your work next we

00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:38,620
have screen magnifiers so this would be

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:40,989
for the user who may not necessarily be

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,699
blind but those have that will be seen

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:44,620
and it will do exactly what it sounds

00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:46,659
like it magnifies the portion of the

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,960
screens just like a magnifying glass to

00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:51,750
make it bigger easier for them to

00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,220
operate the next one we have our screen

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,190
readers we use this a lot in our

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,140
application and what this does is it

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,300
will read certain code within your

00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,760
application or website and it will

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,900
transcribe either elements of web page

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,000
or such commands into verbal text that

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,500
the user to hear so they wouldn't be

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,360
able to see their screen but it would be

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,680
completely described to them so that

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,960
they can still interact with it and

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,790
create a picture of it in their mind the

00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,700
next one we have is speech recognition

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:25,200
so this exists a lot today in the form

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:28,230
of speech assistants or personal systems

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,480
like Siri and what these do is built

00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:33,450
recognize your speech and either write

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,580
out text so you can create documents or

00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,980
even issue commands launch an

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,510
application and conversely we have

00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,670
speech synthesizers with to do just the

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,620
opposite they will take the text and

00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,970
transcribe that into speech that can be

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,300
spoken for someone who has difficulty

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,300
speaking

00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,200
so some users may require one or more of

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,330
these technologies Stephen Hawking is a

00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,590
great example of this he has computer

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,930
that uses software which was developed

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,550
by Intel suffers healthy cat which

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,710
stands for assisted context birds will

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,960
hit and what this does is it provides

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,140
him an on-screen keyboard and a cursor

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,240
which scans the screen by roller column

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,490
automatically and like I mentioned

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,680
earlier he's got infrared sensor mounted

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,930
to his glasses and what he does is he

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,730
will move his Jeep and this will tell

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,900
the cursor where it needs to stop on the

00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,630
screen is printing to make a selection

00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,790
and once he does make a selection it

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,400
will try to either predict his next

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,440
action so fill out the word that he's

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,990
trying to type and also predict the next

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,950
word that it thinks he wants to write as

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:37,420
well so like I mentioned this software

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,570
does provide word prediction speech

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,610
synthesis and for him it works for the

00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,950
infrared sensor but it also were so that

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,960
forms of alternative input and although

00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,030
this offer was initially developed just

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,770
for his usage it's been made open source

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,770
so now anybody we need to canvass

00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:58,259
an important thing to remember here is

00:05:56,249 --> 00:06:01,259
that inclusive design benefits everyone

00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:03,270
you're not just designing for a user who

00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,849
may require it you're also designing

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,610
that you need to do every type of user

00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:10,619
because it makes everyone's lives easier

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,719
it really designed it really improves

00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:15,179
the user experience and just like you

00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:17,939
see in the pictures here there's a user

00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:20,490
who's in a wheelchair accessing the

00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:23,219
chair ramp to get into the building or

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,499
he may need an elevator to get up and

00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:28,020
down pours well you know the sand is

00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:30,029
really required for him everybody uses a

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,499
wheelchair aware of children to walk up

00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:33,719
it's we're building just because it's

00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:34,979
easier or just an elevator because it's

00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:37,709
easier to get up and down the stairs

00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:39,209
instead and a lot of these technologies

00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:40,709
are things that we use a lot like you

00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:43,740
mentioned already keyboard shortcuts

00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:46,080
font size and page soon globalization

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,459
and localization is just translation

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,909
into your local language if you don't

00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:53,159
never use that before voice recognition

00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:54,539
speech assistance auto correct word

00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:58,610
prediction very commonly used by

00:06:54,539 --> 00:07:00,629
everybody even the lips up really apart

00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,209
so the next thing I'm going to talk to

00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:05,249
you about our accessible colors so as

00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:06,749
many as eight percent of men and 0.5

00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:08,610
percent of women are perfectly with some

00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:10,769
important color blindness that may not

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,539
seem like a lot as a percentage but it

00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:13,979
comes out to roughly 42 million people

00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:16,439
across North America alone so that's a

00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,149
very large user base and things you need

00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,949
to keep in mind of this are the text and

00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:22,469
background contrast ratios between your

00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:24,360
colors and also that there's three main

00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:26,459
types of colorblindness these can be

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,800
read green color blindness blue yellow

00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:29,449
or completely covered

00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,889
and in the picture on the left you can

00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,720
see the way a sighted user would see

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:34,789
green and red they can easily

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,979
distinguish between two colors but a

00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:38,810
green red color blind user would see

00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:40,699
them as kind of like a greenish brown

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,069
it's very hard for them to distinguish

00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:45,050
so that you can tell that using these

00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:46,460
within your website or application might

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,060
cause confusion for that type of user

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:54,069
and here's another example of that where

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:56,960
we bought a Rubik's Cube and wait a

00:07:54,069 --> 00:08:00,259
normal user would see the cube they can

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,360
distinguish every single tile and be

00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:05,229
able to solve it really but for another

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,490
user who has some kind of colorblindness

00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:08,930
you can tell that a lot of the colors

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,319
look the same and it would be difficult

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:16,009
for them to solve this queue at the end

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:18,199
of the day so how do you know which

00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:19,370
colors are good and what contrast ratios

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,699
you have well there's a lot of free

00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:25,699
tools online that you can use and the UK

00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:28,039
suggests a contrast ratio of 4.5 for

00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:30,110
small text and free first large defense

00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,510
and what's gone what's large text and

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,789
what's small types anything that's 24

00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,039
pixels or 18 pixels bolded is considered

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:40,060
to be large and smaller than that would

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,860
be small so this tool year color safe

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:45,680
use choose your starting color and it

00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,010
will suggest all an entire palette of

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,020
other colors and they will tell you the

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:53,750
contrast ratio for each of them and it

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,029
will also tell you something better than

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,260
it can suggest and even though these are

00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:00,950
the baseline numbers you should always

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:02,360
strive for something better so next I'm

00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,680
gonna tell you how these this is

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,800
technology's kind of interact with each

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,899
other so first an API in the operating

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,310
system describes the role state and

00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:12,380
structure of the applications user

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:15,050
interface so in our example will the

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,120
screen reader software uses this API and

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:20,750
also a text-to-speech engine to describe

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,579
this user interface to the user so then

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,040
the assistive technology whether it's a

00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:26,690
stranger or another title will access

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,300
the domino web page through the API

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:31,490
understand what each of the attributes

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,769
are and the browser will expose these

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,779
already enabled elements to the API as a

00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:37,579
native widgets so what this does is it

00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:39,860
gives the user a consistent experience

00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:41,690
so that everything kind of translates

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,860
the same way to the API they will

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,190
function the same way when they need to

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,190
use it

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,920
so what sorry how to love it well it's

00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:55,500
compatible with most major web languages

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,660
such as a shin alive XML JavaScript even

00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,129
older versions of HTML and it's also

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,959
know how to old all me draw operating

00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:04,889
systems browsers and screeners so

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,959
whether you're on linux mac or OSX it

00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:11,790
won't matter it's going to work in every

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:13,319
browser the operating system now many

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,269
front-end developers they like to use UI

00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:17,970
UI frameworks on you may wonder well

00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:19,470
does the framework i use support re

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,319
already nor will i have to put it in

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,600
myself the answer it is a bit confusing

00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:26,850
gear because most frameworks do

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,889
implement some form of aria they don't

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,829
go into detail about which attributes

00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:34,500
exactly or what standards they need so

00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:36,480
some really popular ones are dojo Jake

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,790
where you live Google's material you I'd

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,790
buttocks thank you provide some partial

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,829
documentation but it's not enough to get

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,300
you certified so some better are at

00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:47,329
conformance UI frameworks that I can

00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,589
suggest are the foundation framework

00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:52,199
fluid infusion which was developed at

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,660
OCAD in Ontario the web experience

00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:55,920
toolkit which is the UI framework that's

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,319
used across all Government of Canada

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,509
websites it's completely free open to

00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:01,939
use you can see how their templates are

00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:04,019
used if you want to try those and

00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:05,430
similarly there's the u.s. web design

00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:06,290
standards which they use for all their

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,500
document

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:11,480
websites important note about using UI

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,589
frameworks in your application is that

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,389
you always need to test your

00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:17,230
implementation you can assume that the

00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:19,730
frame rate has done all the work for you

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:22,220
although the framework will do a good

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,660
job of implementing these you will still

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,339
need to find you in each individual

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,500
components so that you're getting a

00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:29,120
personalized message to each user so

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,410
that you give some more natural

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,720
experience instead of something that's

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:38,360
really reply so what if you wanted to

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,579
try a screen reader with REI well RS

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,839
just written in HTML and open source

00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:43,730
treating Raiders that you can use for

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,190
each operating system if you park up for

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:49,220
linux and vba if you're on Windows or

00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,420
voiceover which is built into OS X if

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,779
you want to test these implementations

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:56,079
you can also use object inspector

00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:59,600
accessibility inspector or ACC probe and

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,759
w3c validator actually does additionally

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,880
colleague validate re-echoed within your

00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,139
HTML pies that's really handy and if you

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,250
didn't want to check it yourself well

00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:08,870
there's lots of auditing services

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,540
available that they will review your

00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:15,500
code tester implementation and make

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,880
corrections for you I'm going to pass

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,930
some to my colleague lately just comes

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,310
up

00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,750
so now we're going to get into the

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,660
nitty-gritty and actually start

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:28,190
programming so show me pants who's has

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:33,170
some experience with HTML and who has no

00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:34,730
experience at all HTML okay so seems

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,500
that there's more of an intermediate

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,540
audience so I'll go a little bit faster

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,720
but if anyone ever has any questions

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,640
feel free to put your hand up so we're

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,230
going to get a certified first of all

00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,810
let's talk about what does that even

00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,580
mean well the government of Ontario

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,020
requires you to be a certified if you

00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,839
have a company more than 50 employees

00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,279
and this is basically a checklist of

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,290
things that you can do to make your

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,660
application accessible for everyone in

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,490
the next 10 to 20 years you're going to

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,180
have to be double-a and then after that

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:08,089
in the future you'll be triple-a so

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,760
let's get into it step 1 create one page

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:13,220
for all your users otherwise this would

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,250
segregate them from your other users and

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,740
this is really a humane in addition to

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:21,440
this just like Matthew mentioned as we

00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:23,690
use an elevator everyone benefits from

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,520
the accessibility features not just

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:29,330
people who really need it but it makes

00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:32,750
all of our lives efficient rule number

00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:34,880
two use Aria roles this is an image of

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,459
all the roles that you can use an aria

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,290
and if you look closely you might even

00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:42,589
notice that you recognize some of them

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:44,240
for example button or link or image

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,580
these are just things that you'd

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,760
interact with on any web page and that's

00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:51,680
exactly what roles are for so Rose tell

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,660
your user what kind of components have

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,240
they landed on is it a button into the

00:13:53,660 --> 00:14:00,130
menu now something very important is in

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,959
change the role once you dynamically set

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,279
it let's say you have a user they're

00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,899
using a screen reader and they're

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,779
listening to everything on their headset

00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:09,399
and they've gone through the page once

00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:11,320
and they figured out sort of the layout

00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,570
of the page where the sign up button is

00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:16,029
where the menus are and then once you

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,830
change the role if you do then they're

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:19,300
going to have to go and reorganize that

00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,770
whole structure and it's going to take

00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,750
them longer to be able to use your

00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:28,300
application for what it's actually for

00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:31,270
and also the role is more important than

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,380
the tag we'll see an example of this so

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:38,709
you don't have to worry about it right

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:40,630
now so we have a dog and a cat checkbox

00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,640
and you want to ask your user what kind

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,230
of head to you have first of all these

00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,970
are both track boxes so you want to give

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:50,230
the role checkbox to both of these

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:52,660
elements now let's hear pair user with

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:58,510
here once they get to this part of pink

00:14:52,660 --> 00:15:01,630
ok ching ching ching ching can't connect

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,160
books so basically told you that there's

00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,829
a dog and a cat chat box on the screen

00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,800
and then once the user checks that

00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:11,079
checkbox it said checked cat checkbox

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,790
basically letting the user know hey I

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:14,410
just noticed that you click something

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,920
there or you press the button there and

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:21,820
that interaction husband out of taken in

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,140
by the system so what's the code well we

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,260
can see the good practice and a bad

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,420
practice in the good practice it's

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,550
generally best to match your role to

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,500
your tag so the role is checkbox here

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:37,260
and the tag is input of type checkbox'

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,960
but why this duplication you might

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,120
well tags already have some

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,370
accessibility and implementation already

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,020
inside of them so even if you don't put

00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,780
the role it's going to be able to pick

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,910
up some information but because the role

00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:54,090
is more important it's going to take

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:56,640
precedence over the tag if we look at

00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:58,620
the bad practice we can see that it's a

00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,600
do which is basically just saying this

00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,180
is of something that we don't know what

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,980
it is and give it a bullet checkbox then

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,790
the screen here is like okay now I know

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,770
that it's a checkbox so it's always best

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,720
to use tags that are specifically made

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,150
for what you're doing so that you can

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,170
use those accessibility features that

00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:22,560
are already built into it rule number

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:25,110
three use re labeled by and already

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,570
described by these are two properties

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,390
and you can put these on any time and

00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,760
this is basically your chance to really

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,740
communicate with your user and customize

00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,660
that communication instead of it just

00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,750
saying button you can actually get it to

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:42,570
say whatever you want and this way you

00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:45,330
make a very customized and relatable

00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,790
user experience so are you later God

00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,860
gives a name to the element and all

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:52,410
right described by tells the user what

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:56,280
can they do with that element so let's

00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:59,370
look at an example me and Matthew work

00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:01,490
am on developing big blue bucket and

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,350
application at CDOT right here at Seneca

00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,870
so this is the big blue button page and

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:11,100
we can let's just focus on the Settings

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:15,750
button on the top right corner so here's

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:18,839
the code this code here is what actually

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,699
renders the button and we see two

00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,650
attributes let's just focus on the two

00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:27,000
of the bottom there that say re labeled

00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:30,510
by an RA describe line if you notice

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,810
their values for example menu Aria label

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:36,570
match the values of the P tags which are

00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:39,180
paragraph dives at the topic this is

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,940
basically saying to the screen here once

00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:44,510
the user gets to this button read out

00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,680
the text and those two paragraph tags

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,540
you might notice that there's an

00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:51,240
attribute hidden all those paragraph

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,940
tags as well this says don't actually

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,250
show this to the user that's viewing the

00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:59,460
screen only make it accessible to the

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,200
assistive device so in this case when

00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:05,910
the user gets to this button they'll

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,680
hear settings fun change settings now

00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:12,360
they know what they can do with this

00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:14,750
element and what it is notice here that

00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,820
we're using the role to match the tag

00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:20,100
and also if you want to get a little bit

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:23,220
more hardcore you can see another

00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:26,790
attribute in here Aria has papa what do

00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:29,160
you think that might be it basically

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,810
tells the user if they click on this

00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,670
button it's going to have a pop-up it's

00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,230
going to open up a menu of different

00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:37,550
options they can choose and you'll see

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,550
what that looks like in a few minutes

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,820
rule number four give all images and alt

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,490
attribute this is whether they're

00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,920
descriptive or they're informative why

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:51,710
is that well you want the user to have

00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:55,190
the same user experience no matter what

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,450
and so let's say you're trying to you're

00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,220
using the color blue and your

00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:01,580
application to evoke a certain emotion

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:04,130
in the user you want a person who is

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:07,850
visually impaired tinnitus exact same

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:11,240
user experience now when we look at this

00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:14,330
example here we see the sighted user

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:18,160
sees a picture of a robot Asheville so

00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,160
what is the visually impaired user here

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:31,820
so the screen reader lets them know

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:36,260
there's an HTML area and they're viewing

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:38,750
or ad and robotic wolf image this way

00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:42,740
both users all users have the same

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:45,640
experience the code for this is

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:48,230
surprisingly simple we have an image tag

00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,480
the source just tells us where does that

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,100
image come from on the internet and the

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,290
alt tag that's what the screen reader

00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,660
read out so when it said robotic both

00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,820
image so again this is a chance to

00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,030
customize how you communicate with your

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,030
user

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:07,580
rule number five all attractable

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,710
elements should be keyboard accessible

00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,060
and that basically means if you can

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,770
click on something then you should be

00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,160
able to just use the keyboard to do that

00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:18,260
same thing so looking at this example of

00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,050
a drop-down menu you should be able to

00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:23,260
press tab to get two categories and then

00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:26,570
dress it down key to open that submenu

00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:29,150
press the down key to get to development

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:32,660
tools right key to open up that submenu

00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:35,000
and down all the way to item 34 and you

00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,430
can choose that item with an enter or a

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,010
space now there are some defaults for

00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:43,250
this like tab the arrow keys and turn

00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:47,570
space and and we'll talk a little bit

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:52,040
more about how important is to use these

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:53,840
details another example would be if you

00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,540
press the left key you should be able to

00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:01,850
move the slider left and right to go

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:04,040
right now a big button example you see

00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,540
now that the settings menu is open it

00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,470
was that same button that we clicked

00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:12,200
earlier and you see the options are full

00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:14,870
screen settings and new session so what

00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,560
is good visually impaired user when that

00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:20,840
is when he put submenu what's green one

00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,480
of four settings change the general

00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:27,080
settings to perform recession leave the

00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,970
meeting for before so it's all the user

00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,940
that there are the settings menu and

00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:36,110
their options are full screen settings

00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,980
and leave session but did anyone hear

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:43,740
there was actually a bug in this code

00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:47,940
did anyone catch it 404 yes very good

00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:50,280
and so it's actually looking at that

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,160
line in between leave session and

00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,720
settings as another element and the

00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,850
screen reader is mistakenly thinking

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,350
this is a menu option for the user so

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,330
it's very important that you test your

00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:03,059
code and make sure that something that

00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:06,660
you're just using visually isn't being

00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:09,000
translated and properly for using let's

00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,070
look at the code now looking at it like

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,150
this may look a little bit overwhelming

00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:17,400
but we can simplify easily like that so

00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:20,010
it's basically saying if the user

00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,080
presses space or enter you want your

00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:25,770
program to do something if they press

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,760
up/down tab or escape you want them to

00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:31,500
do something and thankfully and a lot of

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,169
browsers this is already implemented

00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,919
these different keyboard accessible

00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:39,360
shortcut but in some browsers not all of

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,980
them will be and it's your job as a

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,860
developer to make sure that these work

00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,200
across all browsers for example Firefox

00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:49,620
usually does a lot better of a job than

00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:53,250
chrome and implementing these so test

00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:57,110
thoroughly and you'll make sure that

00:22:53,250 --> 00:23:00,419
your user can access have a tiny page

00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:03,650
rule number six ensure that there are no

00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:07,890
keyboard traps so coming back to the

00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:10,140
menu here let's say the user presses tab

00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:12,510
and ghost of categories and they press

00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,270
the down key but this time the drop-down

00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,820
doesn't open they try enter in space the

00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:20,010
drop-down still doesn't open so all they

00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,830
can do is just keep going to work about

00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:25,149
and loop back to home and they're

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,129
missing out on a lot of functionality on

00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:29,589
web page so it's very important to test

00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:37,269
for this and make sure your users on

00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:40,659
stuff and this is the last rule notify

00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:41,979
your users of dynamic content remember

00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:44,349
in the beginning when we were talking

00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:46,179
about roles we mentioned don't change

00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:48,009
the role dynamically and this was

00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:50,049
because the user has an image in their

00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:52,629
mind of the layout of the page and we

00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:55,869
don't want to disrupt this and lower

00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:57,999
their speed of using it and also recall

00:23:55,869 --> 00:24:00,669
earlier we were looking at some

00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:03,269
checkboxes a cat and a dog checkbox and

00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:06,759
as soon as the user check that checkbox

00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:08,889
the system let them know so the first

00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:11,580
example is when you don't change the

00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:13,570
content the second example the user

00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,429
interacted with the screen and in that

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:18,099
case you do have to let them know that

00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:24,039
something changed let's look at a third

00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:25,989
example you want to send a tweet so at

00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:27,519
the bottom right corner just notice that

00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:29,589
it shows you how many characters you

00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,779
have remaining before you reach your

00:24:29,589 --> 00:24:33,549
limit so what would the visually

00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:37,809
impaired user here when they get there

00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:41,919
it's happening equant indicates it's

00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:45,099
huge negative fish can take nearly we

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:49,450
want to do technically in detection it's

00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:51,519
in a changing content so let's meet

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,629
later told the user there are in text

00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,259
area where they can type something

00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:59,139
they're also at the end of the text and

00:24:55,259 --> 00:25:01,269
they have 112 characters remaining now

00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:03,940
if the user presses another character

00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:07,119
like I then the numbers should go down

00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,469
to 111 and the user using a screen

00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,260
reader should also have the same

00:25:08,469 --> 00:25:14,440
experience so how do you implement this

00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:17,920
using the programming code let's look at

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,140
it so you see the label at the top that

00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:23,080
says what's happening that's simply just

00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:24,460
the title for the tree we have a text

00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,010
area that's where you can type something

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:31,780
in and notice that it has already

00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:37,780
described by input info do you see input

00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:40,110
info as an ID anywhere on the page so

00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:42,940
you see it in the span right below and

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:46,420
the text for the span says characters

00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:48,880
remaining so what does this mean it

00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:54,760
basically just is saying to tell the

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:57,670
screen reader to read the text here are

00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:00,190
your required is true this means that

00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:01,600
you can't just send an empty tweet you

00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:07,450
got to put something in before you press

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:09,610
tweet re alive is equal to assertive now

00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:12,760
this means that interrupt yourself

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:14,860
interrupt the screen reader a regardless

00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,590
of what's being said to let the user

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:20,830
know that there are how many characters

00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:23,560
are remaining now the other option is

00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:26,470
our polite where it won't interrupt

00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:29,620
itself and actually wait for maybe a

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:32,800
second after it's done explaining

00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,900
everything else and actually users don't

00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,460
prefer this because they want to know as

00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,560
soon as something happens that has

00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:41,470
happened they don't want to wait to find

00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,460
out but you might find in your case that

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:47,860
your users

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:51,160
or something else re atomic is equal to

00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:53,890
false this means present all day the

00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,840
change regions so don't read the whole

00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:58,120
screen out from the beginning if they

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,100
press the cat check box you just want to

00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,620
know that they press that checkbox if

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,060
the characters have changed just present

00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,540
that don't read from the beginning of

00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:09,400
the page and are irrelevant is very

00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,820
similar it's just saying only read out

00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:15,070
additions clicked on and those are your

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:18,730
seven steps to getting a certified and

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:20,860
now you can go out and easily make your

00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:22,810
applications accessible and if you want

00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:25,900
more information you can visit our blogs

00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:27,400
or visit some other useful web pages

00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,970
that we've listed here to get you

00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:34,530
started thank you for listening and

00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:34,530
you'll get yourself a certified

00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:48,250
questions question on one of your slides

00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:50,560
you showed a slider which had a numeric

00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:52,720
value associated with it you have any

00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,430
advice about how to make sure that's

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,990
accessible for example is there a way to

00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,180
communicate not only the current value

00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:03,280
but also the range from Maximum to

00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:04,029
minimum so Billy example that lately

00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,029
that

00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:09,039
where you give a spin with a nike to get

00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:11,859
some kind of description you would give

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,479
that description to your slider so you

00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:16,299
would tell them that the slider exists

00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:18,159
has a range between 0 and 100 and then

00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:20,080
it would tell them also what positions

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,599
are currently there is already

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,029
attributes minimum and maximum as well

00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:27,460
just like there is an HTML edges and

00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:30,099
also once the text changes on the screen

00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:33,219
the screen reader will read any visible

00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:34,929
text as well so according to I guess the

00:28:33,219 --> 00:28:36,549
priority that you give via assertive and

00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:37,869
all that stuff you could say initially

00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:39,849
with the page loads of the minimum and

00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:41,769
maximum or when you're interacting with

00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:43,570
that element and then as you change it

00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:48,639
it will only give you the updates in

00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:50,769
HTML exactly gotcha thank you fresco

00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:52,690
confused by that exact success you're

00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:57,039
typing in a tweet the number treasure

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:59,950
name of the client does it does it does

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,899
the screen reader tell you that your

00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:05,859
number card remaining every time you

00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:07,509
type in more text exactly the assertive

00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:11,320
attribute is going to tell them sorry

00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:16,299
alive you can sort of is to proceed with

00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:17,799
the dynamic element exactly yes so even

00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:19,809
if you don't have re alive it's still

00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:22,690
going to tell you that to change but

00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:24,489
assertive just means to interrupt

00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,020
whatever they were already saying to say

00:29:24,489 --> 00:29:30,260
this

00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:30,260
one of these immediately and

00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:41,220
yes sir it's anyway deposit like if it

00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:43,470
were to interrupt that every character

00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:47,340
it would become annoying oh yes that's

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:49,679
what I was gonna address so you can have

00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,950
a setting where it reads out a whole

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,899
word before it actually says how many

00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,429
characters remaining but the default

00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:58,529
implementation is right after every

00:29:56,429 --> 00:30:01,169
character so it might seem annoying to

00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:03,059
us but to people using strangers it's

00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:05,429
actually more efficient because they'll

00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:07,320
know what's going on at every step of

00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:09,479
the way but if there are typing fast

00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,570
enough the screen here won't have enough

00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:14,999
time to keep saying it for every number

00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:17,070
so built there will actually be a delay

00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:21,119
so it really depends on the user input

00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:22,710
to it also it really helps the user

00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,119
because most cases if they're using a

00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,399
screen reader they're blind so they

00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,929
won't know what keys they're pressing

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,099
exactly unless it's right back to them

00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:31,710
so they want to know right away that

00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:34,009
they smell something correctly or mr. a

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,009
peer

00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,010
any other questions

00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:51,860
how do you like if you got an existing

00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:53,540
far how you incorporate is not very

00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:56,090
likely element part but how to

00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:59,350
incorporate this into the design of the

00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:59,350
actual design process

00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,080
we want to like

00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:09,429
we r you don't know about this to be

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,429
care about it's 20 chickens

00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:15,500
so in our blue button the button project

00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:17,120
we actually had some of the code that

00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,890
was already implemented without any

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,250
accessible features out of doing it's a

00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:24,650
pleasant later so it's always easier for

00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:26,150
the developer to develop with

00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,830
accessibility at the time that they're

00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,990
developing originally but if you have to

00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:33,679
add it later it's still possible but it

00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,970
it will be a more difficult process

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,390
because you might have to change some

00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:41,690
elements work with what you want to show

00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:44,090
the user and likely mention there's a

00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:46,720
lot of things that you need to hide to

00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:49,130
show just for the screen reader so

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,080
sometimes it'll just require having re a

00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,850
trapeze two things you already have and

00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:56,510
sometimes you might need to change the

00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:59,299
structure of your page or application

00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:03,159
completely and this this comes because

00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:06,919
like we use for example lists or tables

00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:09,890
as a structuring thing sometimes just

00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:11,270
for it's a visual convenience but the

00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:13,909
screen remove will actually pick those

00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:16,159
up as tables or lists and it will reset

00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:17,480
to the user as an oyster table even

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,370
though may not be a list retain full

00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,720
visually and so it can be very confusing

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,500
for them so those are the kind of things

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,390
that you

00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:28,730
later it's very much a question of user

00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:30,920
interface designs as opposed to the

00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:33,800
implementation so if you can get the

00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:35,750
design right then the implantation

00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,930
becomes a lot easier but if you already

00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:42,380
have in a an application that doesn't

00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:45,290
have a good design basically the zoo dr.

00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,910
Nolan and then it's going to be a little

00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:49,660
bit more difficult but as Matthew

00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:53,660
mentioned it's definitely possible and

00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:55,930
the only learning curve is reading some

00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:59,780
of the official documentation I

00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:01,130
recommend using other sources like blogs

00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,470
and things like that then regurgitate

00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:07,160
the information a little bit more human

00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:09,170
way of understanding it but as you saw

00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,510
in this tutorial here the code is

00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:14,000
actually very simple it's really just a

00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,920
matter of knowing what does each

00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,990
component do how does it do it and

00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,910
really getting into those details to

00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:23,180
understand it yourself before your user

00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:24,640
even does for their coverage pools where

00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,759
you can look at this

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,300
the process of everyone

00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:31,290
fools where you can look at

00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:37,799
two young fool against your site city

00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:41,090
edition of these X visible features x %

00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:41,090
say the rifle

00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:47,410
I haven't see any tools that will

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,090
detective here website successful or not

00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:51,100
it really requires a lot of human

00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,800
testing so I don't know about any

00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,150
automation tools like that but there's a

00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,330
lot of services that they will do that

00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:01,060
party we have some validators and

00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:04,210
testers listed their presentation i'll

00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:06,910
bring the sign up for you there is no

00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,919
html5 validator through the receipt but

00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,419
that just validates to check your coat

00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:13,300
it even when did it correctly not

00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:16,750
whether it works or not or if it's the

00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:18,970
right application for it but the

00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:21,429
auditing service there if you make this

00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,600
slide available great vest later you can

00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:26,080
click it and they'll take you to an

00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:28,990
Ontario a lot of you website like it's a

00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:31,980
paid service obviously but they will do

00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,980
a full audit of property

00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:40,229
I'm going to thank our speakers

00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,050
