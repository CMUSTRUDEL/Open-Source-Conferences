	00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,580
okay so I'm going to talk more about

00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,260
another aspect of open source that

00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:14,559
people don't talk much about which is

00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:16,390
the business of open source and I have

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,490
to touch you on the funding and for that

00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:23,770
I have to touch on the governance as

00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:25,779
well so I'd also try to be brief because

00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,369
I think Rachel somebody said that the

00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:29,890
questions are more interesting than V

00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:31,419
presentation itself so I'm going to try

00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,790
to condense it a little bit and have

00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:40,240
more more time for questions and answers

00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:42,210
hopefully so open source is actually an

00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,730
economic activity and there were a few

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:49,270
questions actually today about how do we

00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:52,150
make corporations more responsible sean

00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,710
talk about the profit so it's easy to

00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:58,930
condense my streets because you did half

00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:00,730
of it actually so you really have to be

00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:04,089
sustainable in your development off of

00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,890
your open source project and like every

00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:08,530
company like every startup like

00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:11,680
everything it's bound to the laws of

00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:14,320
economics like demand and supply the

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,950
mission diminishing marginal returns the

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,570
prisoner prisoner's dilemma somebody

00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:24,600
asked me what that means and if you're

00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:27,130
curious we can talk about that later and

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,170
one interesting thing about open source

00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:33,430
as opposed to commercial software is

00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:35,440
that what makes it successful is very

00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,060
different than the commercial world in

00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,060
the commercial word you have sales

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,830
people or whatever that go sale to other

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,630
organizations or government and whatnot

00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,659
and if the manager says that your

00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:49,330
project what you did is good then it's

00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:51,310
good it sells in open source is

00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,110
different because you have to really

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,840
work hard to create something of quality

00:01:53,110 --> 00:02:00,250
that people are dot without adoption you

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,740
die right so adoption is what makes open

00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,299
source successful and that's really that

00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,619
should be actually a goal because that's

00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:09,220
how your project grows that's how it

00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:12,609
becomes viable and as an example i put

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,249
this graph about the history of adoption

00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:17,630
of databases but you can find a lot of

00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:20,060
stuff about pretty much everything

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,770
that can be compared about compared

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,790
against commercial software like

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:27,410
browsers internet frameworks pretty much

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,330
anything but these are databases and

00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:33,740
what's interesting to to see here is

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:35,840
that while we see the two lead providers

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,060
of databases Microsoft and Oracle

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,880
hanging in pretty much everything else

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,760
that comes out is open source now right

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:51,710
from sequel and no sequel sort of

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:54,020
databases so open source to become

00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,790
viable as I said it has to be a long

00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,150
term commitment i think somebody said

00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,900
today that to be successful overnight it

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:05,210
still takes maybe 20 years of effort and

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,890
again this is similar to what you see in

00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:11,360
the industry including companies

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:15,500
startups it's bound to this hype curve

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,560
if you want where you have your initial

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:23,240
trigger the peak of expectations then

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,430
the disappointment and the slope of

00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,090
enlightenment and then the plateau of

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:32,180
productivity so pretty much every

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,460
project follows this cycle and this is

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,100
not just the project by the field in

00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:42,280
which the project operates people talked

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:44,690
about IOT today databases and others and

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,930
one import other important thing is that

00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,760
besides these long-term commitment what

00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:54,110
you also need for your project to thrive

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:59,150
our resources meaning time money and

00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:01,190
skills and I put this picture here by

00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,410
the way I think Tom said earlier that a

00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,060
picture is worth a thousand words we

00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,130
have a few tens of thousands of words

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,790
here in these presentations of it's a

00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:16,580
very very condensed one so this image

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:19,280
about manufacturing processes is

00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:24,670
interesting because software development

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,670
processes are very often associated or

00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:30,979
compared to manufacturing pipelines

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,420
right so we have all sorts of metaphors

00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,910
in

00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:37,660
the software industry rejected packaging

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,700
and and so forth people having mentioned

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:44,620
that the with Jenkins earlier today as

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:48,040
well and to manage all these resources

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,890
to have these long term commitment for

00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,130
the project what you have to have is

00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:56,380
good governance and I'm going to talk

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:59,050
more about governance in the coming

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,200
minutes but basically have two choices

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,760
you either choose to have a

00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,820
collaborative model to build your

00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,980
project or we want to have a model in

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,680
which you're the benevolent dictator for

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:15,370
life in which you make the rules so the

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:21,340
question is who makes decisions related

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:24,370
to your project in the collaborative

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:28,000
model there are many ways to build

00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:29,530
communities and that led to quite a few

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,320
foundations the apache software

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,640
foundation being one I know more off I

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,080
know about the other so it'll bit as

00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,520
well obviously the Linux Foundation

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,170
Mozilla eclipse there are many other

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,470
foundation smaller foundations that

00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:46,360
usually copy an operation model of a

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,970
larger foundation of course there are

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,100
universities and there are also

00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:53,680
collaborative projects under the

00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:57,250
umbrella of another larger foundation i

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,380
mentioned ODP I there the open data

00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,270
platform initiative which is one of the

00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,100
collaborative projects of the Linux

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:10,570
Foundation I'm going to talk more about

00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:13,000
that if you choose to go with a

00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,130
benevolent dictator model and by the way

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,660
there is no right to rock like

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,910
everything in life you have to make

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:25,060
choices right you go you take the red

00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:27,100
pill or the blue p the right so here you

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,900
want you have to decide if you want to

00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,750
do it to be a dictator for the project

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:34,870
and govern it as a person or small

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:41,050
circle of individuals or as a commercial

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:42,670
entity the individual person or group I

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,650
mentioned the two guys in the garage

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,380
which is a very common

00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,330
me my thing by the way it doesn't have

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:54,550
to be the same garage these guys were

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:57,850
not in the same garage actually but

00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:02,410
anyway and commercial entities there are

00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:04,509
many many companies that decided to have

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,940
their own open source project but they

00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:11,020
operated themselves I'm pretty sure you

00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:16,539
know many many examples 37signals I

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:18,880
think are few in Toronto here companies

00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:22,240
that sold later on I'm going to touch on

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:26,770
jboss and my sequel if you know anything

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:30,250
about them so what's the secret

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:32,410
ingredient in making your your open

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,229
source project successful obviously it's

00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:37,660
the code everybody talks about that more

00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:41,590
than the other aspects but you also need

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:43,599
infrastructure services and but maybe

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,770
decade the generation ago we had things

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:50,849
like sourceforge I think and others

00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,860
right now we have quite a bunch of

00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:58,120
merely free alternatives like github or

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,650
big bucket so it's less of a problem but

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,340
you still need infrastructure services

00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,990
not only for restoring the code but for

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:08,860
other things like Sean mention for

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,840
collaboration like slack or hipchat or

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,320
all sorts of other alternatives so you

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:20,080
need a number of services to support

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:23,430
development of of your project then you

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,080
have to think about license tracking and

00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,750
grant told us this morning how GPL is

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,820
fantastic and I wanted to have a bit of

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,680
a discussion about that but again I

00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:36,089
don't have to do it because Sean already

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,089
clarified that the patch is better

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:51,360
he meant in the parking lot is you you

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:54,459
have to think about IP tracking and

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,170
speaking of GPL there are there is one

00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:58,779
license well I'm not talking about the

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:02,769
flavors GPL 23 affair and all that but

00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:05,860
there is one GPL license but there are

00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:07,990
two ways in which it's used and it's not

00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,899
really related to the license itself

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:13,450
it's related to IP by the way I'm not a

00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:17,649
lawyer so don't think of this in any way

00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:21,250
is a legal advice so if you have

00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:26,440
something like Linux where the IP is

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:29,529
owned by a large number of distinct

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,800
entities usually people there is no one

00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:35,350
company that can take that code and

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,100
relicense it under a commercial license

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:42,760
or anything else whereas there are quite

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:46,899
a few projects that are GPL some are

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:50,910
perfect or used to be perfect right now

00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:54,190
there are 30 s sorry about it so we're

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:56,740
because you own the IP and is you offer

00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,470
it under a GPL license but because you

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,570
own the IP basically your competition

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,690
cannot really contribute without also

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,220
giving you the IP right so you kind of

00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,730
put a barrier to entry for your

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,980
competitors and because as Sean said

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,019
company said we hate GPL we can really

00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,149
use GPL you say not a problem I own the

00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:18,180
IP so I can also rely since is under a

00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:22,240
commercial license and we're fine and

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:25,390
later on you can sell your company for

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:30,699
300 plus million dollars if you're jboss

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:33,940
or my sequel to somebody like redhead or

00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:37,779
oracle respectively right so it's not

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,940
just the license it's also the IP

00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:43,990
management and there are a lot of other

00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,370
issues trademark I think it's obvious

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,810
you have to protect your trademark

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,260
because if you don't enforce it is not

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:52,720
protectable later on right

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:58,720
other kind of legal protection we know

00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:01,930
of the big Beto that still ongoing bit

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:06,820
of it in Oracle and Google regarding if

00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:10,090
api's are patentable or not you are you

00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:13,450
familiar with that case so the apache

00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:16,120
software foundation was an amicus part

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:20,950
in that in that lawsuit and actually I

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:23,290
think Stefano matsutake one of the very

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,030
smart Apache Apaches members that was

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,590
involved in that was actually taking the

00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,110
stand at some point and we were

00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,910
following that online and we kind of

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,440
felt bad for him because he was under

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,890
the attack of the lawyers who try to

00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,960
actually protect billions of investments

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,970
from their company so it's not really a

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:43,150
particularly particularly nice position

00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:50,890
to be as a developer when huge financial

00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:53,230
interests come into play so I don't know

00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:55,560
who when they start to start an open

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,510
source project things about these issues

00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,550
but they think and obviously there is

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,230
marketing marketing told me yesterday

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,850
that you should invest like five times

00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,580
in marketing the University in

00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,190
development and I don't have to make the

00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:13,620
case anymore because the speaker before

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,620
me was way more elephant that I could be

00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:20,190
so I'm going to talk a little bit about

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,320
the effects of the foundation it's a

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:26,280
501c3 nonprofit it's a charity actually

00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,810
so because of that it cannot really

00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,970
endorse any commercial activity or it

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,890
would lose that that status it's an

00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,350
all-volunteer organization meaning that

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,420
Apache does not pay for work so all

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:42,330
commuters contributors there are

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:45,460
volunteers they are not paid by Apache

00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:48,520
it's also community of communities I'm

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:53,040
not talk more about that in the sense

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:55,810
that every project that Apache is

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,420
governed managed independently the

00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,580
apache software foundation does not

00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,410
really interfere with the project it

00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,050
just set some guidelines for

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,449
the project so that the foundation can

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,639
protect it so the Apaches of the

00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:11,319
foundation is kind of like a umbrella DT

00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:16,379
or a legal entity that protects the

00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:18,850
projects that operated Apache so I

00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:20,439
previously don't confuse the patches of

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,879
the foundation the foundation itself

00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:24,639
with the license there are many other

00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:25,899
projects that are licensed and they have

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,579
nothing to do with the apache software

00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:32,500
foundation and they're licensed under

00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:38,319
the usually Apache public license

00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:40,449
version to a bit of history about the

00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:48,490
page i think it was mentioned before it

00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:50,819
started with httpd in around 1995 this

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:54,430
was a web server a project that was

00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:57,310
abandoned by the National Center for

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,879
supercomputing applications which by the

00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:03,490
way operated I think and out of

00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:07,480
university in the US the university of

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:09,910
indiana at urbana-champaign so i'm going

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,480
to come to this later to universities

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:18,699
are fantastic ground for doing

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:22,810
open-source the first release was in the

00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:24,850
same here december first and the issue

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:27,420
was that the project was abandoned but

00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,920
the group of people felt that it's

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:34,060
useful they didn't want really the code

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:37,480
to die and i think grant mentioned

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,430
earlier today about his emotional

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,230
attachment to a project that dies up

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,089
because of lack of funding and then you

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,399
have to decide am I gonna invest my time

00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:48,279
to make it work or don't or not really

00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:50,610
if you can sometimes if the IP is owned

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:54,430
by the company you can even do it right

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:57,279
so and even if you can you have to think

00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:00,879
if it's economically reasonable it makes

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,439
sense to continue working on it so what

00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,459
the Apache group at the time it was

00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:05,649
called the Apache group before

00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:09,069
incorporating as a foundation as a

00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:11,380
foundation in 99 that was one of the

00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:13,000
first goal if you have useful stuff can

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,820
we create some sort of framework so that

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,260
useful pieces of code like this don't

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:25,480
and the whole culture was rooted in the

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:29,230
IETF culture that basically was talking

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,000
about consensus and working code so you

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,430
don't have to come up with all the

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,260
details he'll have a project manager

00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,690
Gantt charts and all that kind of stuff

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,340
if you have some consensus about where

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:42,130
you want to go you know we're going to

00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:46,030
fix the details later just put some code

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:51,850
together to express our ideas Linux is

00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:54,610
the same way right and another critical

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:57,790
thing which is part of a petticoat

00:15:54,610 --> 00:16:01,360
values is that good software is produced

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:04,630
by good healthy vibrant communities so

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,940
what the Apache Foundation does it makes

00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,980
sure or it tries to make sure that the

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,230
projects have a healthy community first

00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,570
and then they let that community produce

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:16,420
the code any way they want because they

00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:18,670
know that the healthy community produces

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:23,890
good code and we know that by experience

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:27,640
over the past 20 years well 16 17 since

00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:32,470
it was incorporated so where is Apache

00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:34,180
today I didn't put the source of this

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,460
light it's actually actually coming from

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:41,320
projects that Apache dot org there are a

00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:44,260
number of grafts they're more coming so

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:48,370
you see the first project while was the

00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:51,850
HTTP d server in 1995 and then projects

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:56,530
were added during the time and now we

00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:59,110
are at over 300 project if you consider

00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:02,910
those in the incubator top-level project

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:09,300
i think it's about 180 or so is the

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:12,880
yellow line and some of the projects are

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,560
not necessarily successful in time they

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,500
lose interest from the people who commit

00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:22,180
there and they kind of die if you want

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:24,070
so Apache has a place called ethic they

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,610
move to the Attic actually that's what

00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:28,449
that's what the red lines below the zero

00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,130
line mean

00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:31,929
it means that a few projects in those

00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,779
months were moved to the Attic they were

00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:36,850
retired the code is still there somebody

00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:40,149
at any time can take it forked do

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:42,130
whatever they want with it but Apache

00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:44,440
there is no Apache community around it

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:50,559
anymore the community actually died the

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:54,100
code is still there and I'm going much

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:57,909
slower than I then I plant so the Apache

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,860
way I mentioned values community / code

00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:01,799
it has a permissive license it's

00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:05,019
actually the only license that actually

00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:08,230
touches on on patents there is a clause

00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:11,740
i think the fifth clause that says that

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,960
if somebody contributes code under the

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,179
apache license not necessarily at apache

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,470
but under that licence it implicitly

00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:23,590
gives access to any patterns that code

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,539
might be infringing upon so that you

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:28,210
cannot really so later on your

00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:29,620
downstream users for using a project in

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,230
which you contributed code that

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,950
infringes on one of your patents makes

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:38,350
any sense very important things to think

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,510
about because they may cost you later on

00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:44,049
and another thing it's a meritocracy

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:47,500
patches a meritocracy that basically

00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:49,750
says that whomever does the work makes

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,850
the decision right so if you're willing

00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,559
to do the work then you're right other

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:57,539
people if they contradict you they have

00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:57,539
to do some work to prove or disprove you

00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:09,499
I will talk more about other foundations

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,239
like the Linux Foundation at the edges

00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:19,940
of the foundation actually I think is

00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:22,279
the next slide the project rose so we

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,289
have users a lot of people who use the

00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:26,960
code and you don't know if they just

00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:30,289
take the code they use it our users they

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,919
don't interact with Apache with the

00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:35,929
community so these are users they well

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,729
we're not aware of them but once you

00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:40,700
start interacting with the Apache

00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:42,830
communities be it by asking a question

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,979
on a mailing list you can you

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,149
instantaneously become a contributor

00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:50,059
right because you contribute something

00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:52,070
to the community and if you contributing

00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:54,159
enough if you contribute code not

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:56,269
necessarily some people contribute

00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,679
documentation some people promote the

00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:00,619
project's via talks and all sorts of

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,320
stuff in time you get buried karma

00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:05,419
whatever communities call it and then

00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,820
you can become a committer a committed

00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:12,259
Apache somebody who has the right to

00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:13,970
touch the code and if you are a

00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:15,649
committed for a while and you understand

00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:18,139
how bad she works and you understand the

00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:19,909
legal aspects of releases and how the

00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:24,169
Holy this process works and the votes

00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:27,619
and also if you're aware of that then

00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:30,349
you become a PMC member the PMC is the

00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:33,200
project management committee and as a

00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:36,139
member there you can do a lot of things

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:40,309
like vote on releases vote on who else

00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:42,739
gets invited but in terms of project

00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:44,749
development they don't have more power

00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:48,460
than the developers the commuters

00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:52,129
themselves or even just contributors

00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,779
okay that's very important so the PMC

00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:56,179
has to do with the community not with

00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:59,359
the code committers have to do with the

00:20:56,179 --> 00:21:01,940
code and then there is a 1pm see chair

00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,009
which is actually he doesn't have any

00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,979
extra power anything he's just the

00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:10,759
liaison with the board of Apache and he

00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:12,799
has a role of VP in the foundation so

00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:14,610
he's technically an officer of the

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,160
foundation

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:19,380
and all these e our project rolls that's

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:23,670
how projects themselves are managed

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:26,190
Apache the front and I have some

00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:30,000
committer stats over here you see that

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:35,190
we grow to about 6,000 committers almost

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:39,830
today you can see more on projects at

00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:43,799
the patch it work and the Apache

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:46,590
foundation rolls the way the foundation

00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:48,840
itself is organized you can become a

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:51,270
member of the foundation sort sort of a

00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,860
stakeholder I'm not sure how many we

00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:57,809
have right now I think around six seven

00:21:52,860 --> 00:22:00,960
hundred there is a annual meeting every

00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:04,760
year in which new members are nominated

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,940
and then voted in members are actually

00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:10,919
in most cases with rare exceptions

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:13,679
recruited or nominated from already

00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,330
existing committers and PMC members

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,780
people who understand the foundation

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:22,940
there are very few who came they were

00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,940
nominated and voted in as members for

00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:31,620
contributions at the foundation level

00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,059
not for contributing to projects so

00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,460
there is the board there are 99 people

00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:37,919
on the board they get voted once a year

00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,100
during that member meeting by the

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,010
members who are obviously shareholders

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,840
there is a president there are the VPS

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:49,530
for the projects I mentioned before the

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,919
PMC chairs and there are also VP's for

00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:56,400
operations we happy peace for trademarks

00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:59,160
Shane we have VP's for president

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:07,080
marketing Sally we have a president for

00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:09,450
fundraising and there are others so that

00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:13,290
is how the foundation is organized and

00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:16,530
the members by the way they oversee all

00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:19,320
the projects at the Apaches of the

00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:22,550
foundation they can basically look what

00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,169
happens in the community there are any

00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:26,440
flame wars going on there are those all

00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:30,490
the time

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:33,549
there are issues between vendors that

00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:35,139
use apache projects who bend rules

00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:37,090
regarding trademarks and all sorts of

00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:42,279
things because they have to make some

00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:51,190
money as well so that's what the members

00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:53,289
and the board are doing and that's

00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:55,659
pretty much about governance I want to

00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:58,149
move to talking about funding the

00:23:55,659 --> 00:24:00,940
project and one interesting thing I'm

00:23:58,149 --> 00:24:07,269
not sure how many how many noticed why

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:13,029
did Sean dye his hair green interesting

00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:15,070
question so there are two separate

00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:17,289
aspects in funding your project one is

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:20,169
funding the resources for your project

00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:26,799
to to survive right it's the

00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:28,809
infrastructure to run your git repos to

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,269
run your testing if your Jenkins or

00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:35,769
Travis or something else Apache has its

00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:38,019
own internal services by the way so you

00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:39,789
need money for all this kind of stuff

00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:42,639
and then there is the other part of

00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:45,070
funding who's going to find work right

00:24:42,639 --> 00:24:47,620
you have to think of that as well Apache

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:51,129
as I said doesn't fund work they don't

00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:54,190
pay for contributions but the patch it

00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:57,399
does fund or does provide the resources

00:24:54,190 --> 00:25:01,570
for infrastructure and marketing and

00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:02,980
everything for the projects and this is

00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:06,629
for the last ten you from the last

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:09,370
annual report and you can see that the

00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:10,899
total the expenses were were about for

00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:14,850
the three hundred projects we have our

00:25:10,899 --> 00:25:17,289
about a bit under 1 million dollars

00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:22,929
contrast that with the linux foundation

00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:26,500
that has an income of about 30 million

00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:30,129
over 30 million dollars right and then

00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:34,210
sits off over over 20 million dollars so

00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:36,549
for all the work we do I think we do it

00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:38,979
on a very decent very small budget that

00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:46,669
any manager would laugh at

00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:48,950
but again we don't pay for work so how

00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:51,440
can you find your projects well you can

00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:53,419
have donations usually they don't work

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,179
very well in the early stages of a

00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:59,539
project but they work a bit better once

00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:02,299
you the project becomes larger I think

00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:05,599
the most known example would probably be

00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:08,239
the very foundation maybe that package

00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:17,269
the open office project apache

00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:20,749
openoffice project thank you but it's

00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:23,989
based on the apache / which is actually

00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:26,509
donated by by oracle right after the

00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:29,539
acquired son anybody knows which is the

00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:31,669
largest I mean the latest project that

00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:36,019
was moved into a patch the Apache

00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:39,079
Incubator hint coming from Oracle you

00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:41,209
don't know netbeans about the month ago

00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:43,039
two months ago I lost track of time so

00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:45,679
NetBeans is now in the Apache Incubator

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,659
so as I said donation usually come from

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,359
a large number of people small amounts

00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:56,599
kind of like Bernie Sanders I shouldn't

00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:58,820
go there sorry campaign but it works

00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:00,919
well again when you are establish people

00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,499
know about you they use the product or

00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:07,599
the project and make small contributions

00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:10,509
that gets you going another thing that's

00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:14,239
probably the most relied upon is

00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:17,659
sponsorships every large foundation or

00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:20,239
project does have its own sponsors it's

00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:22,369
done in different ways pesci being a

00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:24,619
charity is much it's very different than

00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:26,509
the newest foundation that recognizes

00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:28,459
contributions from organizations

00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:30,409
actually it's organizations actually

00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:32,119
supplied the funds to be at the next

00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:34,070
foundation and they nominate the people

00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:36,979
they want their it's a different choice

00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:39,019
a different structure apache as i

00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:40,879
mentioned before is trying to make sure

00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:42,889
that as long as there are contributions

00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:45,109
there is a community there the project

00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:47,119
doesn't die the linux foundation for the

00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:50,119
collaborative projects they say if there

00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:52,039
is no money for this project it should

00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:54,919
die right so who

00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:56,899
right and wrong who knows different

00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:58,940
views and i'm pretty sure that for some

00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:01,460
projects one approach is better than the

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,019
other and for those who contribute or

00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,220
want to contribute open source project

00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:06,139
or started their own open source

00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:11,389
projects there is another thing to think

00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:14,269
about another thing that sponsors open

00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:16,489
source projects it's used its is grants

00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:20,149
but at least in the US i don't know how

00:28:16,489 --> 00:28:22,850
it is in canada and in the u.s. it's a

00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:24,649
paperwork nightmare and it's not just

00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:27,889
the paperwork itself because you could

00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:30,710
say that okay that's the way it is the

00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:33,200
problem is that there are only two times

00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:34,909
a year when you can get those blends

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,399
approved i think in january and in june

00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:39,440
so you have to prepare that grant then

00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:41,149
you have to work for it for some nine

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,639
months and there is an evaluation period

00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:45,559
and then you can get into a second phase

00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:48,619
and get more funds the problem is that

00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:51,739
this grant funding process doesn't

00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:55,129
really evolve at the same place as the

00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:58,099
industry right so you can't really plan

00:28:55,129 --> 00:29:01,210
so in general i think grants are good

00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:08,419
but it's probably not the smartest

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:13,070
primary means of funding Oh grants from

00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:14,479
from very good question there are grants

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:16,940
from governments there are grants from

00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:18,049
the industry from corporations those are

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,179
more flexible because these you

00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:22,159
negotiate but i was referring more to

00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:23,979
government grants but they are not the

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,190
only grants there are grants from

00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:31,099
everywhere but I referred mostly to

00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:34,820
government grants European programs have

00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:38,359
their own grants as well and there's

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:40,159
also venture capital and as we know

00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:45,379
there is a big difference between the

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:48,590
valley and the east coast right I'm

00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:51,440
sorry about the picture so you can see

00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:53,989
what's your name Lori I think and then

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,570
after that it's your own robert herjavec

00:29:53,989 --> 00:30:00,559
who's not in the picture so I apologize

00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:04,159
for that this is the US version of shark

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,539
tank right another option is to join a

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,190
foundation and then the

00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:08,749
foundation depending on the foundation

00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:14,720
you choose is going to provide some of

00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:16,999
the resources and even this is it can be

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,519
done in multiple ways so I mentioned Oh

00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:20,929
DPI before on purpose because before on

00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:25,190
purpose because I wanted to get to this

00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:27,679
so Oh DPI is promoting actually the Big

00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:30,350
Data technologies and the big data space

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,239
but the actual work happens at the patch

00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:34,039
in projects like Hadoop and the

00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:40,070
ecosystem and spark and stuff like that

00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:42,529
but for promoting for corporations to

00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:45,109
promote the technologies they start with

00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:47,239
the ODP I project at the links

00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:50,659
foundation and both coexist actually

00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:53,090
very well so you can come up with a

00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:55,669
business model where you actually join

00:30:53,090 --> 00:31:01,129
multiple multiple foundations or have a

00:30:55,669 --> 00:31:03,249
mix of of business models i also want to

00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:07,369
talk a bit about the Apache Incubator

00:31:03,249 --> 00:31:11,179
which is a special kind of project by

00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:13,869
itself so it has its own its own pmc I a

00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:16,429
member of the incubator pmc as well and

00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:20,659
now and then you have some group

00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:22,820
proposing a project to join the Apache

00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:26,539
Incubator there is sort of a standard

00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:28,369
standard form you have to send to the

00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:30,289
end to the incubator then there is a

00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:33,320
discussion about the merits of the

00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:37,369
project Apache was the project to be

00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,109
past the initial idea phase basically

00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:43,129
have some working code and maybe a small

00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:46,789
community and basically proved that it

00:31:43,129 --> 00:31:49,519
has some some future and then there is a

00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:51,679
vote in the incubator pmc and if the

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,470
vote goes usually does then the project

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,849
gets gets accepted in the incubator

00:31:53,470 --> 00:32:02,570
where for a number of months is going to

00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:05,659
increase increase the codebase commuters

00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:07,009
put more codeine you vote in more more

00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:09,379
commuters basically you grow the

00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:11,779
community you do a few releases to

00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:13,369
figure out the release process and the

00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:17,119
legal aspects of the release process I

00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:18,500
mean and after when you think as a

00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,300
community in the ink

00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,820
better that you got the idea you know

00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:25,730
how to do it then you basically ask the

00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:27,350
incubator to allow you to graduate and

00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,720
there is another vote and then you

00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:32,660
graduate as a top-level project dlp if

00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,000
you heard that acronym or join another

00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:37,960
project basically merge your code base

00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,330
with another project at the patchy that

00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,390
you think matches what you're doing when

00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:46,040
project centre incubator by the way

00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:47,810
usually they look for a champion which

00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:51,430
is an Apache member that guides them

00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:53,900
through the process and at least three

00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,810
mentors that are going to help the

00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:02,680
community during the incubation period

00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:07,640
to go through the Apache basically rules

00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:10,700
and the last thing I want to talk about

00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:14,570
is the paid work how do you found fund

00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:17,420
your work not for the project itself but

00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:20,600
how can i be paid as an individual to

00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:23,570
contribute code to open source even here

00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:26,660
you have quite a few a few options one

00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:28,550
is no funding but in that case it's kind

00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:34,310
of like a hobby right you might as well

00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:38,180
go fishing you have to have a balance in

00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:41,650
life right so there are people who do

00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:43,820
that because they have a need because of

00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,350
believing in a course because of

00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,530
whatever reason and they don't

00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:52,250
necessarily expect something in return

00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:55,130
they just invest mostly some time the

00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:57,350
problem is that if we call it a problem

00:33:55,130 --> 00:34:00,230
it's not necessarily sustainable for a

00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:02,330
project to rely on work that comes now

00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,640
and then from people who are marginally

00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:06,470
interested in the project so for the

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:11,600
project itself this kind of work is

00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:13,970
probably not not sufficient what else

00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,669
you can do and I think this is the case

00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:21,310
for the majority of people at Apache is

00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:24,409
find work and be employed by a

00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:26,240
commercial organization that has some

00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:30,350
interesting that in that open source

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:32,190
project grant for instance employed by

00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,079
HP right

00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:38,179
who is the sponsor of Apache thank you

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:42,839
very much Microsoft he mentioned is a

00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:44,099
sponsor of Apache as well redhead I

00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,869
think the row talks from people from

00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:51,720
read it is a sponsor of Apache as well

00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:54,329
so if you work for these organizations

00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,119
you can if you if you work a little bit

00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:58,609
harder you can find a place you can find

00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,040
organization that would basically

00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:03,780
sponsor you pay you a salary to work on

00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:09,260
something that you believe in and that

00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:11,569
is also achieving some balance in life I

00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:20,760
wanted to talk about this later but

00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:23,490
consider this if you work on I'll be

00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,950
congruent again on the linux kernel okay

00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:29,040
and you work in a company what was the

00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:31,260
company word for before okay and they're

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,579
working they were interested in linux

00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,300
right and do what with the team not by

00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:39,480
yourself so those people contributed

00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:42,180
patches as well did some work some ideas

00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,550
that they shared with you and all that

00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:46,319
stuff right and then you move somewhere

00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:48,690
else now the question for you is this

00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:51,859
did you work for that company or did

00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,859
that company work for you

00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:01,030
right so they also they paid you and

00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,070
they also contributed a lot in enriching

00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:06,610
you so that you can use the technology

00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:09,910
later in your career so in my personal

00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:19,570
opinion you have to be nuts not to work

00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:21,430
in open source okay another option crowd

00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:24,580
founding there are people who do that

00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:26,650
you can start the crowdfunding campaign

00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:28,180
campaign there are a few sites that

00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,310
allow you to do that there are by the

00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:36,130
way in the US for sure on or about

00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:37,810
Canada investment funds that special

00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:40,350
specialize in cloud county so they are

00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:45,790
investment funds that are crowd found

00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:49,240
crowdfunded to invest in different

00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:51,850
opportunities so crowdfunding was and is

00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,740
quite popular that's another alternative

00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:55,780
you can start and campaign say I think

00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:58,330
this feature is missing in this project

00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,550
I think it would be very useful I think

00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:02,320
I could do it over the summer or I'm not

00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:04,150
going to be employed for three months or

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,280
whatnot and if I be found that this

00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:09,400
level I would implement it There is

00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:12,550
obviously no guarantee but it's a choice

00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:17,470
and people do it so something to

00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:19,990
consider and you can also find your

00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:22,210
coding for your contributions to an open

00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:30,400
source from other activities like being

00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:33,970
a consultant right you create other kind

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,790
of value or material like I don't know

00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:39,250
trainings or books or whatnot and that

00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:41,110
allows you to contribute usually at

00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,230
night or what not to the open source

00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:46,660
project you care about but it's funded

00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,840
basically not directly from being

00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:52,030
employed to work on that on that project

00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:55,570
and the one that is the most interesting

00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:57,340
to me is being self-funded if you think

00:37:55,570 --> 00:38:01,830
there is a value in the open source

00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:05,020
project you want to contribute to then

00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:06,700
you can start the company you can talk

00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,040
to other people there who you consider

00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,290
smart or valuable or

00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,680
but not create some sort of a group and

00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:16,440
start marketing it and market and market

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:20,310
and get some some revenue profit is

00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:23,700
super important it's what allows you to

00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:25,770
get going or again go to venture capital

00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:28,200
you have some other alternatives there

00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,720
as well and actually create a product

00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,730
around it create take the project and

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,290
solve the problem with it and convince

00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:37,680
people that it solves a problem and they

00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:43,190
will pay for it so something to be

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:46,340
considered as well so with that said

00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:49,800
open source software is an experience

00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:52,470
join the movement I wanted to know you

00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:56,760
better how many contribute to open

00:38:52,470 --> 00:39:01,320
source projects Wow and outside the

00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:05,760
university some other projects okay

00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:08,610
fewer I'm curious why but well I don't

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,940
think it's the right forum to to answer

00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:13,830
that I would encourage you to take a

00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,680
look and find stuff that you think is

00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:19,350
valuable and really interact with people

00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:24,750
there most of the people are nice until

00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:28,520
they are not but Apache by the way and I

00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:31,380
think somebody mentioned that before we

00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:36,320
try very hard to encourage more women to

00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:39,270
join the open source movement because

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,720
and we have people I mean who want to

00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:45,210
help well we know that it's a bit tricky

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,580
with this male-dominated industry but

00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:49,410
anyway I think there is a lot of value

00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:52,680
from for more contributed in

00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:55,410
contributors especially women so anyway

00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,970
I encourage you to really try interact

00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:01,590
with more people at least you get more

00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:07,250
ideas and its really enriching so with

00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:07,250
that thank you very much any questions

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,650
I have one question regarding the

00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:16,859
crowdfunding you mentioned in a

00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:18,780
potential way to bring money into an

00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:20,369
open source project so with you know

00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,950
with the advent of technologies like

00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:26,520
Bitcoin blockchain this sort of stuff

00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:28,799
I've heard of companies or startups or

00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,480
projects what if you're offering what

00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:32,849
are called initial coin offerings where

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,549
they into token or a coin that's perhaps

00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:38,970
equivalent to some exchangeable for some

00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:40,770
service or exchangeable for shares in

00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:43,349
this company and wanting whether you

00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:50,039
comment on the most or technology or

00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:53,849
developments in terms of funding yes so

00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:56,730
in any transaction you give something

00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:58,230
you get something if you're happy with

00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,079
what you get you happy with the

00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:02,880
transaction if you are happy with

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,640
bitcoins that's fine if something else

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:10,710
motivates you like I don't know paid

00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:13,950
trip somewhere or I remember the

00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:16,589
etherium guys were at some point in a

00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:18,510
big house in Florida coding together and

00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:20,549
somebody else paid for it so whatever

00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,660
you get gaining return whatever you give

00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:23,880
youth if you think it's a good

00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:28,020
transaction then why not the issue is

00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:30,510
that is if you get cash for to fund your

00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:34,589
your work it's very clear what you're

00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:36,230
getting the value of cash is pretty well

00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:40,200
understood by the rest of the society

00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:43,650
right and whereas if you get coins you

00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,329
don't know how to read you may not know

00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:47,339
how to value that with coins right now

00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:50,670
it's a bit easier because you can see

00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:54,240
what the day today value of the coins is

00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:55,829
but I don't think there is any secret

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,869
formula right if you're happy with the

00:41:55,829 --> 00:42:04,130
transaction you make then you make it if

00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:04,130
not you don't good night

00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:12,109
yes but I just comment on several times

00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:15,349
you were talking about you were setting

00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:18,849
up in opposition free numbers or

00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:24,799
software licensing versus commercial

00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:26,510
licensing correct which is the reason i

00:42:24,799 --> 00:42:29,180
do that i did that is to get you

00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:31,760
thinking but what's the question well so

00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:34,579
is it are you deliberately saying

00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,160
commercial or as opposed to proprietary

00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:39,680
since clearly there are companies who

00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,260
use freedoms or software and licensing

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:48,260
and commercial endeavours so they're not

00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:51,230
really in opposition I wonder if that's

00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:52,819
they can be in opposition I personally I

00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,769
don't really care it's in the eye of the

00:42:52,819 --> 00:42:57,650
beholder if they are Indian opposition

00:42:54,769 --> 00:43:00,260
or not my point is that you have to make

00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:03,710
a choice you get married you make a

00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:10,910
choice is it good is it bad for knows so

00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:19,190
I think it's safer to talk about the

00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:21,019
u.s. elections so there is not I mean in

00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:23,450
work in the world in general there is

00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:26,150
really no right or wrong or maybe there

00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:29,420
is but only future will tell my point is

00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:31,369
that it's worth it probably to think

00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:34,359
about this aspect be aware of them and

00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:41,539
think about them before you embark in

00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:45,500
creating a perfect thing right so that

00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:47,779
really was my point and commercial there

00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:51,619
were some other comments today about our

00:43:47,779 --> 00:43:54,500
corporation it's evil maybe maybe not

00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:56,660
but actually if you really think about

00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:00,109
it it's us who reward them for their

00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:01,910
behavior by buying sometimes is the

00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:03,589
government that we paid we don't have a

00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:05,859
choice and we pay taxes to them and they

00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:08,779
have corrupt people who reward them but

00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:10,640
you know hopefully we're going to get

00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:15,589
rid of these practices but at the end of

00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:17,720
the day if we think it's what again us

00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:21,290
stuff right is buying cheap stuff from

00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:23,660
china good or bad if we think we save

00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:25,910
money to do something else good with the

00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,680
money that we have left maybe it's a

00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:31,010
good thing maybe it's not I don't know

00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,230
so it's always about choices but we

00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:36,470
cannot blame somebody without realizing

00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:55,540
that our the incentive systems we create

00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:55,540
is actually we have other questions yes

00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:31,360
why is there a method inside

00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:33,520
if you are things that there is a method

00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,290
and it's called moving it to a into the

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,490
Attic when there is no community around

00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:41,680
it that's the only method okay so but if

00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:43,210
there is no contribution anymore and

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,980
nothing happens the board is going to

00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:48,640
say there is no point for this project

00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:51,730
to exist so that is really the short

00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:54,700
answer to your question I wasn't

00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:58,690
involved personally in the apache

00:45:54,700 --> 00:46:01,930
openoffice project enough to understand

00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:04,960
the nuances and the details but from

00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:07,000
what I know how much code does

00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:12,340
LibreOffice have on top of apache

00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:16,030
openoffice percentage wise but is not a

00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:25,480
fork okay I don't know enough it is

00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:28,870
completely fork from I so the market

00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:43,540
will decide from my point of view then

00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:46,660
was the problem there there is one

00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:48,430
that's true and so I'm aware of those

00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:51,130
discussions actually because I'm the

00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:54,490
board member at least actually so that's

00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:56,740
how I know some of the details there was

00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:58,360
a constant flame war for years between

00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:03,640
the two communities and my understanding

00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:07,590
is that so there is another point you're

00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:10,000
making without making it anybody can

00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:12,940
because the apache license is permissive

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,290
on purpose we say take our code using

00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:17,830
make money do whatever you want with it

00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:20,290
we're happy that's fine anybody can take

00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:22,120
any project not just open office tom cat

00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:24,550
i don't know what projects you used any

00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:26,200
one you can fork it take it in a

00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:28,060
completely different direction you can

00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,650
say that you guys start with an

00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:31,960
architecture you're going slow and in

00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:33,910
the direction but i think you should

00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,640
incorporate blog change you should do

00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:38,890
this kind of stuff which means forking

00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,829
the project go ahead do it

00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:43,690
prove your point that's not a problem

00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:46,740
for the apache software foundation we

00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:49,950
don't feel bad about it we don't prevent

00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:52,660
you from doing it I mean if you think

00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:55,329
the idea has some merit we even

00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:58,539
encourage you to do it the LibreOffice

00:47:55,329 --> 00:48:00,730
versus apache openoffice is a conflict

00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:04,150
of a different nature its personalities

00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:06,430
and a lot of stuff that it's a waste of

00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:11,380
time for developers actually and I think

00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:16,539
thank you mentioned that as well you

00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:19,990
don't find this I think this is an

00:48:16,539 --> 00:48:25,269
example of the fact that communities are

00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:27,579
hard communities take work the there is

00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:31,450
all kinds of histories in history and

00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:32,890
LibreOffice open office it's been you

00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:38,920
know that was something that started way

00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:40,750
back in the Sundays when promise it's

00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,210
not and there's a lot of history there a

00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:45,519
lot of the history and background of

00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:47,049
things that go on in communities there

00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:49,089
ends up being a lot of things that are

00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:51,519
going on in the background they'd never

00:48:49,089 --> 00:48:52,690
get fertilized and then it explodes out

00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:54,279
and then the issue becomes about

00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,769
something else so then the issue in

00:48:54,279 --> 00:48:58,690
LibreOffice open office becomes wise

00:48:56,769 --> 00:49:01,029
Apache wasting time and Libra officer

00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:03,160
open office or libre office which is one

00:49:01,029 --> 00:49:04,660
and that misses the fact that there's a

00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,849
whole bunch of history and that says

00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:10,240
nothing about the apache software

00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:12,839
foundation that is a reflection on

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,930
what's going on within those communities

00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:18,569
and so I you know I quite appreciate the

00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:21,549
way the apache software foundation

00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:22,960
emphasizes community that is critically

00:49:21,549 --> 00:49:25,390
important bearing project that we were

00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:29,380
involved with and I encourage for anyone

00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:31,240
who is looking to get into a an open

00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,670
source project or start an open source

00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,980
project to be thinking about the aspects

00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,310
of

00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:39,380
immunity if you have great divisions

00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:40,900
between your developers you're going to

00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,450
have a whole lot of trouble making

00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:48,950
programs that the code doesn't matter

00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:50,450
very much if you can't work out and you

00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:52,550
also mentioned in your keynote this

00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:55,430
morning that people sometimes I are

00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:57,590
wired to hate the other Microsoft or

00:49:55,430 --> 00:50:00,200
whatnot and things might have changed

00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:01,910
and then you have to rewire that and so

00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,010
that takes a lot of effort and some

00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:05,780
people don't even care to do it some new

00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:08,690
people don't even know the history and

00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:11,750
you cave peril talks so it takes a lot

00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:13,730
of work it's not easy but again I don't

00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:18,680
know the details I know some of what's

00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:20,810
going on but the foundation itself says

00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,580
that as long as there is a community and

00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:24,950
people who want to continue working on

00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:27,260
that code by all means we're gonna

00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:29,359
support you if you want to abandon that

00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:31,790
and do whatever go to LibreOffice or

00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:35,109
what but not that's fine too it's not a

00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:43,869
foundation issue it's a project issue

00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:43,869
makes sense any other questions yes

00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:02,430
fantastic question that's why the

00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:05,700
foundation is there if you contribute a

00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:08,670
the PR and you think that those morons

00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:10,740
over there don't even look at it appeal

00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:13,530
to one of the members or to the board

00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:15,810
and that's what's going on I think I did

00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:18,540
work again some merit and something

00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:20,820
should happen people are busy that it

00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:23,160
depends on the project some projects

00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:25,710
have people who work on it on the

00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:28,250
project in their spare time so they may

00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:31,470
not have time other projects work for

00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:33,780
other people in projects work for

00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:37,380
companies with an agenda and oh don't

00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:39,570
review PRS on purpose so it depends what

00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:42,990
project you're talking about but again

00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:45,360
if somebody wants to contribute on

00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:47,970
Apache project the pesci is very

00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,250
inclusive on purpose and if you feel

00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:52,650
that the project the PMC actually

00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:57,890
doesn't do a good enough job there are a

00:51:52,650 --> 00:52:00,150
lot of other ways to fix the problem

00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:05,250
satisfied with the answer or you want

00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:06,600
more details but that's a problem by

00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:09,150
though it shouldn't happen and I hope

00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:11,550
it's a beautiful the isolated incidents

00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:13,290
I know of a few and in active and q is 1

00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:16,470
for instance i sent an email last week

00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:21,870
that there are 41 PRS actually some from

00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:23,370
last year that nobody looked at and jb

00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:24,810
for instance a good idea we should look

00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:28,350
at that and i'm going to look at them as

00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:30,980
next week as well so there are it

00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:33,120
happens but it shouldn't and that's

00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:35,550
because as i said people are overwhelmed

00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:38,070
or whatever other reason but these

00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:41,580
things if people bring them up they get

00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:43,500
resolved faster because you have more

00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:47,220
eyes on the problem and usually they get

00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:50,340
fixed fist faster thank you very much

00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:52,530
agree so I think is very quiet

00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:54,240
in this first day right you had the day

00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:56,760
with bookended by sort of perspective

00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,430
one let's say end with a licensing

00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,050
spectrum in open source and then from

00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:03,830
the other and you know thank you very

00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:03,830
much Adrian traitor

00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,940
