Title: FSOSS 2016: Introduction to Progressive Web Apps
Publication date: 2016-11-25
Playlist: FSOSS 2016
Description: 
	Speaker: David Humphrey, Professor with Seneca College

Over the past decade, the dominant computing platform has switched to mobile. With this shift we've seen an erosion of open source's influence on user's lives, with greater platform control from dominant vendors, and especially in user applications: apps have been built with native, proprietary technologies. However, the open web hasn't gone away. While people don't install thousands (or even dozens) of apps, they do visit thousands of web pages. Progressive Web Apps (PWA) combine the best of the native platform with the best of the open web, creating experiences that can be installed, used offline, enjoyed on different sized devices, and accessed across vendor platforms. "Progressive Web Apps" is an umbrella term that refers to many existing and emerging technologies, best practices, and approaches. This talk will introduce the main concepts and show how to build a PWA.

that's just called wa on the web and try

00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:20,740
and go from high-level not going to be

00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:29,820
approached day nursery Craig examples

00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:33,480
and comes to web I'm going to use it

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:36,280
going on yer so progressive web apps are

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,249
fairly new I don't know how many of you

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,929
too personal you're here in this talk so

00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:45,010
there was not for the title to get you

00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:51,399
in the room but it's a graphics or so

00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:55,870
yup some people the concept is be able

00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:59,960
to take estimated up the web

00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:02,210
and this is something that's possible

00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,550
because of an emerging set of web

00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,590
standards especially being done by

00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:09,190
chrome but they have been widely

00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:12,260
implemented across various for others Oh

00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:16,970
google has not really push the push the

00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:19,880
way formulas so first off I want to set

00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,290
set the stage for some what we're going

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,870
to talk about I want to begin with

00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:28,550
thinking about mobile in general so this

00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:30,200
is a slide from Benedict petals as a

00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,610
great presentation called mobile is

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,430
eating the world if you haven't ever

00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,500
looked at his slider more it's fantastic

00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:39,170
in terms of the kind of kinds of

00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,990
statistics that has but I'd look at this

00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,850
point as an example so this is going to

00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,160
2014 but you're like me and you've been

00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:51,210
involved in computers for a long long

00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:54,750
time he shows shows pcs

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,880
pcs can see the scale the numbers here

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,220
but this black line represents pcs that

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,770
are sold and we're talking about

00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,600
hundreds of billions of pieces if you

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,130
think about how transformable pieces are

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,000
these have been this is what we're

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:12,420
talking about here client this carriers

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,630
and smartphone iOS and Android phones

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,420
you're talking here about billions of

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,209
almost millions of slices of millions of

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,840
pcs that difference is I think it has

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:27,060
snuck up on the logs many of us who are

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,239
in the room today I know think in terms

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:33,030
of desktop machines laptop machine keep

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,739
ours longer but we really have moved

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,769
into a new era we've moved into

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:41,600
something very different and that is

00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:41,600
pervasiveness mobile and mobile apps

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,430
this I saw the other day and I loved

00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:53,420
what is this orange in a web browser and

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:57,700
this this is this is really important in

00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:02,150
September 2010 wired ran a cover article

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:04,220
that said what was dead the planet and

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,630
they need to know that and 26 seconds

00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,430
hard to imagine the weapon being dead

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,490
but at that point wired was pretty sure

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:13,160
the web was dead and they obviously had

00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,390
a backtrack on that but in 2016 the web

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,280
is bigger than it's ever been the

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,350
presentation if you're just here in

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,490
previous talkin saw some of the kinds of

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,230
innovation that people are thinking

00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,000
about with those thinking about with

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:26,270
devices and inter device connection and

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,910
so on and just how much of the web you

00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:31,820
use that one time you today your life is

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:34,450
a mix of native apps and the web and

00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:41,020
mobile web is huge it's a big part of

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:44,360
platinum in 2012 Mark Zuckerberg

00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,460
famously said that one of the biggest

00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,709
mistakes they made a facebook is betting

00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,760
on html5 they had tried to rewrite

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:53,730
facebook as the web

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,890
and they fail the performance of the web

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,379
time has been a disaster for them and

00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:04,170
they have to factor out so they invested

00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:06,269
a ton into iOS and Android us and her

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,640
locks changed in the last four years so

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:12,599
this was another interesting slide that

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,030
was pulled out by DNA John on Twitter of

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,590
Ruby another project so he says it is

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,570
blog post program to where the

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:22,949
performance puck is going to be now it

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:25,050
has been nice Gretzky quote there this

00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:28,470
slide here shows the performance of the

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:31,650
jet stream JavaScript benchmark running

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,860
on a macbook and running on the iphone 7

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,840
it's actually faster on the iphone 7 so

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,979
we've gotten to a point now I was got a

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,479
lot of curses from this week because

00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,669
their hardware is lag so much especially

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,410
on their laptops if you watch the event

00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:44,620
yesterday you know that you know even

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,090
what they put up yes

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,160
isn't as fast as it really could be

00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,570
widget says that are built but it's

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,840
really unbelievable to think that your

00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,190
phone is now faster potentially or it's

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,410
going to be faster than your laptop

00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,260
especially with Marvin chipsets you're

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,240
seeing Moore's Law just continue to go

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,100
down and up down it really is it's an

00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,229
unbelievable situation so JavaScript

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,990
performance forms of the web in general

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:09,880
has got to a place now where I don't

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,770
want to make the claim and I'm not you

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,449
know Mars our program has more insight

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,880
into what they did there but would it be

00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:17,800
possible to rewrite and make huge

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,090
complex apps and mobile today for the

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,860
little web today and the answer is

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,639
definitely us because we see so many of

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:27,760
them this is the situation we find

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:32,949
ourselves in with with apps in the App

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:34,960
Store I will ship it up stored in 2008

00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:37,539
and this is your interstate because of

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,070
the first iPhone came out in 2007 there

00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:40,600
really weren't at so there wasn't an app

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:45,160
store it's hard to remember that time

00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:47,530
now they marketed that device heavily as

00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,860
having the web so when the iphone came

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:53,169
out i mean every new platform gets its

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,030
content by leveraging its previous

00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:57,020
technology and the web is consistently

00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,030
that's why that orange has web browser

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,949
because everyone needs to have a web

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,220
browser in order to bootstrap their new

00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:06,319
platform to have content the problem

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,680
with app stores is you know it says

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,710
right here you have talked charts if you

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,280
are developing for the App Store Google

00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:19,759
Play and you are Facebook or your

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,190
YouTube or you are whatever your

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,409
snapchat snapchat Instagram you're doing

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,530
well and people have installed your up

00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:29,960
but if you're not one of those it's very

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,300
very difficult to get see app stores are

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,430
designed for hits they're designed for

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,069
the top 20 it's like music on the radio

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,409
it's very very difficult for you to cut

00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:43,159
through the noise and get yourself

00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:45,259
noticed another great tweets according

00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:48,740
to that graph there are roughly 140

00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:51,680
thousand new websites per day last year

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,229
we added roughly 100,000 apps scale of

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,210
the web is unbelievably different for

00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:59,300
the scale vows yes there are a lot of

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,819
apps to focus on stage at the apple

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,330
event yesterday noting the fact that the

00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,740
Apple TV the new Apple TV that they're

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,710
talking about they have eight thousand

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,820
apps or Apple TV I mean it's sort of

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,040
ridiculous to think of

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:17,030
how small that number is right obviously

00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,220
off TV is a niche platform etc but if

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,530
your Apple and you know your app scales

00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,790
8,000 for that so there are lots and

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:31,040
lots of apps so the thing is that

00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:33,770
there's a lot more websites those

00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,680
driving here rather than I saw the signs

00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:39,950
like a picture of it and this is subway

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,760
restaurant down the rap how many of you

00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:54,040
are writing subway up bless your heart

00:07:43,760 --> 00:08:02,270
no more oh go ahead and download it and

00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:05,030
nobody's reaching for the phone don't

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:08,540
install the subway up why don't they

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,880
installed the subway up the talk seven

00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,820
percent of heart or more owners in the

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,500
u.s. account for almost half of all of

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,570
the download activity this is there

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,320
really interesting statistic the average

00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,870
American

00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,420
and I would say ksr as average American

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:27,410
engine together smartphone users

00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:32,180
download coming 0 apps and one how many

00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:33,590
apps up you down to it in October and

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,700
you're probably a highly tough you're

00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:39,860
probably this group of here is not right

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,690
people at a technical conference people

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,640
who drove resources people who are

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,610
making about their devices a lot and

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,680
you're very engaged and people just

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,930
don't download out most people don't

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,780
tell me everything's up people spend

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,400
their time in just a handful about they

00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,310
said they spend their time listening to

00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,550
top 40 rather than listening to back

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,650
catalogue river keep your magic so Chris

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,890
Henderson have long time ago talked

00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:09,050
about this idea probably her buddy this

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:12,290
is his dragon I wouldn't calls long tail

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,900
that increasingly instead of just having

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:17,510
kids people spend most of their time in

00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,600
his long tail maybe you're interested in

00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,459
some niche thing that I'm not interested

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,290
and the web enables that in a way that

00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:26,019
we don't see with us it's not worth my

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,420
time to build an app for all different

00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:30,490
platforms marketed putting these app

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,220
stores go through the rigmarole but

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,649
people do do it with websites and so

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,139
people skills come during their time in

00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:40,509
that long tail yes they use facebook

00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:42,579
yesterday is YouTube so on but they also

00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:44,259
use all sorts of other obscure wonderful

00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:49,540
things and that's the power of one of

00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:51,940
the powers of the web we've seen quite a

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,680
few attempts at what I'm going to show

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,480
you today if I'm gonna show you today is

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,190
one more time it's not necessarily the

00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,990
best way but it is yet another way we're

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:02,079
seeing this happen so what I meant

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:04,839
called audible web versus of the web so

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:08,769
adobe has tried it with air technology

00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:10,980
they did firefox OS tried to do it by

00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:14,680
building a phone out of HTML CSS

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,829
javascript blackberry tried to do it

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,810
webos electron is another things one

00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:22,600
right now a lot of desktop apps that are

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:25,360
built with web technologies even the

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,149
album TV uses javascript for a lot of

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,150
bits for programming its apps but it

00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:31,440
doesn't have a dozen

00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,150
some of the four things that we would

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,350
think about is being integral to prevent

00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:39,840
things like links just having all of the

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,640
platform of the web available to it so

00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,350
building things with web technologies is

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:49,860
different than building things on and

00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:52,200
for the West whatever so this question

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,370
plagues us and in some ways this is an

00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,630
interesting question because it almost

00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,640
depends where you are on the

00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:59,730
generational divide do you think about

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,160
the web as a series of documents static

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,770
websites web pages and so on or do you

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,300
think about them as apps or do you think

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,520
about all of the end of as being all of

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,710
the above some of you will have grown up

00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,840
in a time box and your world has been

00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,400
dominated by out the generation that's

00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,860
coming right now that's pretty much all

00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,080
they don't all right mobile devices

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,080
these billions of devices and running

00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:24,150
apps for others of us you know I started

00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,820
with the Webster I was doing all this

00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,170
names websites and web pages and web

00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,480
rings and all these different things

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,910
that used to exist and so essentially

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,400
because the web can't decide what it is

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:39,800
if the weather was owned by a company if

00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:41,990
the web was a product somebody would

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,269
already it would have said not the web

00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,519
is dr. backward got documents as the

00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:49,010
choice long long ago when asked you

00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:49,779
along the web seemed to be capable of

00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:53,110
doing out

00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:55,089
a web could morph and absorbed and it

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,980
could do apps and now it does both of

00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,620
these things and other things too so

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,550
part of what has allowed the web the

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,320
survivors elasticity it does

00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:08,370
is it's a hybrid of a lot of different

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,640
things so things that we're going to

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:14,580
talk about things progressive about us

00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:17,130
we're first defined by this guy alex

00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,589
russell and he's a chrome engineer at

00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,870
Google and he wrote a blog post of

00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:24,649
working called progressive web apps and

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:28,440
he sat down and he was thinking about

00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:31,440
how did it how do you aim to the kinds

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,720
of web pages that he was seeing home all

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,490
the things that people were doing so

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,850
just read this so part of what he says

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:41,190
these apps aren't packaged in Floyd

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,160
restores they're just websites that's

00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,470
the first key insight and these are

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,260
websites that is

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,210
they took all the right ways so they

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,980
keep the web's asked when you need a

00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,560
permission model and they added new

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,510
capabilities it goes on it says users

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,240
don't have to make a heavyweight choice

00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,980
up front and don't implicitly sign up

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,710
for something dangerous just by putting

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,300
on a lane the web has succeeded above

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,670
all other platforms because of its

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,220
installation and update mechanism is

00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,900
unique anywhere in the world how have

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,130
you go to gmail it's a different

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,350
application that you're running you

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,800
don't think about it in those terms

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,260
except one phrase that what's happening

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,930
sighs that want to send me notifications

00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,880
or be on your home screen have to earn

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,720
the right over time

00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,890
more MORE they recive need to come out

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:34,070
this is what he's saying this is his

00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:34,070
concept so let me take you through what

00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:41,450
where are the hallmarks of these these

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,450
after this way of building for the web

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,170
first place of their progressive so you

00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:50,800
may have heard the term progressive

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:53,230
enhancement or progressive degradation

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,279
and it's a term that first came out in

00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:59,170
2003 red body of the browser Wars and

00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:01,839
you have criteria companies that were

00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:04,959
battling it out over control of the

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,029
internet and so somebody would introduce

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,830
a feature to the web somebody else

00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,779
wouldn't have it and as a web developer

00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,630
you're building something that needs to

00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:15,730
work on different browsers and it was a

00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,100
terrible time because people didn't

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,080
compete by playing standards they

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,600
competed by innovating and proprietary

00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,290
ways so progressive enhancement was an

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,209
idea where if I give you a web page it

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,580
should work on any browser that you run

00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:32,380
it on it may not do all of the things in

00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,510
all of the browsers but you should have

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,580
something should render text it should

00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:39,459
be usable on some level that was the

00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,020
idea behind it and that is still here

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:43,120
the reason that progressive enhancement

00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,880
is still really important for what I'm

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,060
going to show you

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,520
Wow not all the browser vendors have

00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,680
implemented all of the standards yet so

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,140
we're talking about a way of building

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,330
that works vertically in some areas and

00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:58,730
not in others what should work well in

00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,650
all so really there's been a shift

00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,860
instead of thinking about having your

00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,960
out degrade their thinking about making

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,990
an app which will eventually do more

00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,490
right so for example I'm going to talk

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,830
to you today about a technology called

00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,890
service workers really popular right now

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:18,050
very new and service workers is not yet

00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,880
implemented sorry but they're working on

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,650
it to plan it in all of your rest of the

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,450
browsers that you see there like there's

00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,950
an example of something right one of the

00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,920
key pieces of what we're going to talk

00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,360
about isn't there on iOS and it's coming

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,400
so what do you do until it gets there

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,540
you have to deal with them get the deal

00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,590
in flower so these actually progressive

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:41,420
the next thing is these apps are

00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:43,310
responsive we all use the web I haven't

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,470
get use the bevel on an orange but it

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,970
makes your point you're using it on all

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,470
sorts of different devices so if you're

00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,900
on laptops right now so we were on

00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,400
tablets some of your on things that are

00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,710
even know what they are they laptops or

00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,170
tablets or like we are in a space now

00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:59,120
where we don't know your on-base screens

00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,560
you're on televisions but you're

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,339
bringing the web and things like cars

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,680
and so the ID

00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:07,740
the web looks a certain way has been

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,079
eroded the web is whatever devices are

00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,790
working on so these apps need to work

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,470
well in all different conditions whether

00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:17,149
it's on the phone around your desktop we

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,149
shouldn't copy making decisions

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,100
one of the things that these apps do is

00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:26,220
they treat the network as an enhancement

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,810
which is really a bizarre thing the

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,610
thing about as long as we've been doing

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:31,740
the web the one thing you need to do the

00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,320
weather's you need to network you can't

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,700
get to the surfer you can't do anything

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,520
but one of the things I'm going to show

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,170
you is through service workers and web

00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,990
storage it becomes possible for us to

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:46,550
build apps without any network at all

00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:49,350
and this is really critical so network

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,270
optional or using treating the network

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,030
as an enhancement is key for a lot of

00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:57,030
reasons whether it's because network is

00:16:54,030 --> 00:17:00,600
bad power goes out for example which

00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:02,610
happened to Evan in the chemo or you

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,890
can't get on the Wi-Fi or you're on a

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,240
train and the Wi-Fi or that your signal

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,160
is thank you on your cell phone you're

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,199
in the mountains or maybe you're just

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,780
paying high data rates you're Canadian

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,900
who pays high data rates long yes and

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,480
the quick up and you don't want to shell

00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,339
out for network activity all the time

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,490
often you may want to run your device

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,199
without data so we want to be able to

00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,010
treat the network as an optional thing

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,010
and only you

00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,040
these websites need to feel like a nap

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,710
so we're going to see that it's possible

00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,049
to run these web pages these web apps

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,700
without looking like your browser we

00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:42,100
don't have to have a URL we don't have

00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,360
browser around the outside of it it can

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,400
just do whatever it is you're working

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,620
out which is really poor especially for

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,450
people to feel like the boundary between

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:54,880
what is it made of alkaloids the web

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:57,010
page can be here with erased I said that

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,780
the network is optional but we also know

00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,790
that we live in a world where data is so

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,130
so critical and when I say data I need

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:06,429
real-time updates whether it's status

00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:11,049
updates news liberty's camping to

00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:12,880
services so these are apps which also do

00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:15,490
what the web does best which is pull

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,679
information off the network so they are

00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,750
always up to date and they use a really

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,320
interesting combination of caching

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,320
mechanism

00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:29,140
these ads allow you to reengage your

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:33,909
users so they do that through push

00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:35,350
notifications it's a it's a it's an odd

00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:37,630
thing to think about a web application

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,909
running when you don't have when your

00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,710
phone is like this and interacting with

00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:44,409
your lock screen it's not the way you

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,850
think about interactive web but it's the

00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:47,890
way that a lot of us interact with our

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:50,230
apps somebody emails you to get a

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,779
notification you have an alarm and that

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:56,860
notification comes up we can do that

00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:58,750
with progressive web apps these are apps

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,120
that have to be right over secure

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,880
connections they have we run over HTTPS

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,429
stuff over to work so that's part of the

00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:11,289
security model of it as baked into it is

00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:13,630
pushing the web board HTTP as always

00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:18,250
approach

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:20,830
because their websites these web apps

00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:24,550
are discoverable you need to just use

00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:27,520
urgent they are after all links so you

00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:29,830
can you can pass search engines index

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,650
them which has been a huge problem for

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:34,810
much of native apps how do you get

00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,190
people to deeply into your app it's a

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,710
really hard problem is the problem with

00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:41,320
flash its problem with native apps and

00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,390
there are workarounds work but the web

00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,010
and solve that problem long ago so we

00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,860
can take advantage of that just using

00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:52,420
standard phase that web should web page

00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,920
work these apps are sheriff in the sense

00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:57,610
that all you need to get to them is a

00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,500
URL so if I can email you or textual URL

00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,090
you can get onto this to you can go to

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,120
the search engine and find it you can

00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:06,280
get on it too they're making use of the

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,780
largest web store if you will in the

00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,090
world

00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:13,280
to the web itself but being able to buy

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:16,880
these things simply because usually

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,130
also they're installable so the hardest

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,470
place to get a code you write today

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:26,060
right there on that home screen and if

00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:27,470
you look at using typical surrendered by

00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,890
asking you to show me your home screen

00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:34,430
which I won't do but what I'm probably

00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:36,440
Facebook Twitter an email client I don't

00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:38,240
know instagram you're using social media

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,510
you're using you're using the hips

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:45,110
you've got top 40 apps on your phone you

00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:46,880
all of you Val useless but maybe

00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,620
somewhere up here in a folder called

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,390
other or something like that you have

00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,150
that long tail of things that you are

00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:55,100
interested as well schedule for a

00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:57,020
conference or something that's timely to

00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,940
what you're doing right now being able

00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,460
to take a web app and put it on your

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,780
home screen if for something that you

00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,460
want to interact with over and over

00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:09,770
again it's really important we can do

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:13,550
that so these apps begin life as a link

00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:16,280
as a URL inside of a browser tab but you

00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,320
can promote them they can progress to be

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,490
comment

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,500
that's the idea so let me take you

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,820
through that's the concept of it we take

00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,110
these are some of the text that makes

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:31,570
impossible this is one of the first one

00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,250
which is has been perfect about for

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,350
quite a while but it has been extended

00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:38,500
so if you haven't been keeping pace with

00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:40,630
modern trends in web development web

00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,970
workers have become more north and

00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:45,519
essentially a web worker is background

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,440
thread news there's a whole different

00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,649
who's a series of different types of web

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,210
workers web workers shared workers and

00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:54,460
now the stink hole the service worker

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:58,029
they have similar things in mind which

00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:01,360
is but I should be able to write code

00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:03,460
JavaScript code which runs off of the UI

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,230
thread so the main thread that the user

00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,360
is interacting with I can have another

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,909
thread that's doing things like talking

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,639
to a database which is communicating

00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:15,250
with WebSockets to other players in the

00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:17,559
game which is generating passwords or

00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:20,289
hashing files or priorities but it's

00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:22,470
doing some complex task on a background

00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:26,019
thread so you don't walk up me through

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:28,419
the big difference here and what's new

00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:30,800
in and what is unlocked which one but

00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:35,000
here is this concept of a service worker

00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:38,420
so that's full are a couple of diagrams

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,700
from people who build this but the

00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:43,820
concept is this imagine you write a

00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,560
script and typically with a web worker

00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,810
or with any JavaScript when the page

00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,330
clothes is where we close that tab and

00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:52,400
cotto scoffs but that's not a case with

00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:55,160
a service worker so a service worker

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,650
gets installed as it were it can run in

00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,090
the background it runs separately to the

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:02,180
page that you're working on right now

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:05,270
and even more importantly the service

00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:08,240
worker is allowed to step in between

00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:10,790
your web page and a network so you have

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,040
a piece of code which can handle

00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,720
requests and response a sense

00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,360
essentially what you have is going to

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,390
webster you have a web server built into

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,630
your browser for that domain so if a

00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:26,300
page needs to request something it asked

00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:28,430
for a URL and this service worker can

00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,590
make a decision it can either go to the

00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:33,470
network and get it or you can go to a

00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:36,050
cache that it manages and then service

00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,540
you with one of those two things there's

00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:40,710
a various ways that this gets used so

00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:43,500
here's a slightly different snare

00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,600
in this scenario you have page which

00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,779
goes to the service worker asks let's

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,960
say it us for a CSS page so your app

00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:53,580
uses CSS you ask you the CSS and go to

00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,940
the service worker on the service worker

00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,799
says I'm going to go to the cash and I'm

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,929
going to request it and I'm going to use

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,580
it out of my cash here but I'm also

00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:03,940
going to go to the network at the exact

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,279
same time

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,379
fresh my coffees into the couch so it

00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:10,480
stays up to date that's not strategy you

00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:12,580
can use other times you might want to

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,730
use the network first and then fall back

00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:17,350
to the cash sales or you might say I'm

00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,330
going to go to the cash and the network

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:21,190
at the same time whichever one's faster

00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:22,450
i'm going to use that there's a whole

00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,490
bunch of different strategies you can

00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,980
use as a programmer to decide how this

00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:30,549
works but essentially what you can do is

00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:32,440
you can control the routing and the

00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:35,320
caching of all the things that get shown

00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,820
here essentially if you've been doing

00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,340
web development at all you've been doing

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,409
this you have a server running in PHP or

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,210
Python or whatever it was and you had

00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:45,970
everything else in a web page now

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,240
collapse all that and you can do it in

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:50,799
here so it's a really different model

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,350
this thing runs even when the page isn't

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,330
there so if the user asks for the page

00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:57,879
itself they open up a browser and they

00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:01,740
asked for a page it'll go here to get it

00:24:57,879 --> 00:25:01,740
if it has very very powerful

00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,990
another thing that has changed that

00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:09,030
allows us to do this again these are

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,710
standards that have existed for a while

00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:14,730
we're just taking advantage of them is

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:17,010
web storage the whole different levels

00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,990
of storage local storage special storage

00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,390
and then these last perfectly important

00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,960
one called index me and one called a

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,960
storage

00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:29,659
I think it's not well known to a lot of

00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:32,960
people that you can store hundreds of

00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:35,509
megabytes of data or a web page inside

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,399
the browser so it can be anything you

00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:39,320
want it's not easily used to think about

00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:41,299
cookies and you're going to store little

00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,999
bits of information but I might want to

00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:47,599
store may have hundreds of megabytes of

00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:49,549
images I might want to store data I

00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,679
might want to duplicate a database on

00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:53,450
the server for offline access I mean I

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,470
can do all of those things using index

00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:59,570
TVs index to e is a key value storage

00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:03,440
mechanism that's that's associated with

00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:06,590
the domain the caching storage allows me

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,470
to take requests and response so

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,899
essentially i can i can use URL based

00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:14,299
instead of a key value para you are

00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:15,400
elves and responses to cash late and i

00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:17,510
think

00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:21,230
again I know when I go into too much of

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:23,630
the depths of the tire but using that

00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:27,430
concept what i can do is i can free our

00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:30,350
protect how I build a web page or web I

00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:33,050
can build using a model that looks like

00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:36,410
this I have an application shell and

00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:38,390
then I have content that runs inside

00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,220
so now you're building something like

00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,080
Instagram or Twitter or whatever it is

00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:45,140
they follow a similar pattern you have a

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,930
nap yeah has a menu that you have to

00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:50,750
work with it has iphones a test images

00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:52,940
it has scripts you have essentially what

00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:55,070
you need you want to boot your app the

00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,800
most basic concept of your app running

00:26:55,070 --> 00:27:00,350
that's the OP show this thing here we

00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,090
put in the serviceworker cash it so that

00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:05,030
it's available even when there isn't a

00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:07,430
connection to the web then everything

00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:10,370
else that you see in here text images

00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:12,410
and so on think about how we would do

00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:14,660
this give it back to the days at ASP of

00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:16,970
PHP or whatever you would do would tend

00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,710
to do a database and then template an

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,750
HTML you would do a query to the

00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,060
database we get the data and then you

00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:25,370
produce HTML that looks like whatever it

00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:28,340
is the d-link router here we're doing

00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:30,980
the same thing we put this data into an

00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:33,320
index DB data storage that's attached to

00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,530
the web page in the browser and then we

00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,270
can generate web pages out of that so we

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,640
can do that with a combination of the

00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:43,730
caching storage index TV and service

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:48,760
quarters so we separate out of the data

00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:48,760
of an app from the shell or this thing

00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:55,200
another thing that's possible now is the

00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:58,020
fact that push notifications have made

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,030
it into the better so that I can I can

00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,560
re-engage you and you may look at this

00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,480
as an annoying thing I how many web

00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,160
pages have you been to that say you know

00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,570
random web page would like to send you

00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,480
notifications and your first things

00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:12,570
don't allow this no no no I don't want

00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:16,020
but maybe you do want up maybe this app

00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:17,610
is useful enough to you that you're

00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,370
going to allow a couch in the app store

00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:22,230
model we just installed that big blind

00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,490
oh sure it shows you a big long list of

00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,460
things that you're a drink to your like

00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,890
installed I want Oliver and every app

00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:30,720
even some stupid game has a notification

00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:32,400
that pops up you have to go in and turn

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,820
nothing off it's not that different here

00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:39,750
so re engaging users with no browser tag

00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:42,510
required again we take advantage of the

00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:45,090
serviceworker so if a server sends a

00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,850
push message to a mobile device the

00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:49,520
operating system gets it in

00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:51,500
to the browser browser wakes up your

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,080
service worker and allows your service

00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,880
worker to decide what to do so again the

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,410
hunk of JavaScript code was running

00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,720
there's no browser showing there's no

00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:02,150
web page the breadth of service worker

00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,460
can show a notification to the user so

00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:07,280
on their lock screen for example with

00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,080
actions delete this email yes I want to

00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,870
go and look at this updated or whatever

00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,730
it is the service worker can also use

00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:15,890
that time to go to the network and

00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:17,990
download whatever it needs to in the

00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:20,120
cash so if somebody has sent you a new

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:22,670
message you want to go and download that

00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,960
message to bring that in we can be you

00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:26,240
know we can do that so that when they

00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,980
click on the notification content is

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,980
fresh it's the most recently

00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:37,039
the last thing I'm going to mention here

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:41,269
is the vacuum we have standard now for

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:45,399
how to specify metadata about Emma and

00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:50,120
it's called manifesto JSON it lets us

00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:51,950
include it in the head of our our web

00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,710
page we can say you know here's a link

00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:57,559
to a manifest of JSON file and it looks

00:29:54,710 --> 00:30:01,039
like this you can specify things like

00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:03,620
the name of the app discuss by icons at

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:06,830
different sizes you can specify any more

00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:08,929
l2 show when the app starts etc all the

00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:11,179
metadata that describes how this action

00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:13,129
functions in here you can also do things

00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:15,820
like this you can see this is the same

00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:18,570
web up running in two different ways

00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:21,419
here is being run in

00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:24,750
and here's being run stand alone so

00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:26,730
there's no URL right is just faded into

00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:28,830
it you can even do things like you can

00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:32,130
control the background color and theme

00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:34,230
color so that your app merges with the

00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:36,360
operating system colors if you want or

00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:38,309
it looks like it's made about it it

00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:42,200
feels like it's part i can click on

00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:42,200
something and running its part of the OS

00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:49,480
okay examples let me show you a whole

00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:54,520
bunch of examples and see if I can get

00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,750
mine and if you've got a phone I know

00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,540
you didn't want it down to the subway

00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:00,370
out but I wanna compare these were so

00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:06,420
try these jor-el zone is for talking so

00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:06,420
the first one is low tech stuff work and

00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,750
see

00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:31,190
I better running here and I've got my

00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:31,190
dev tools of the

00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:39,290
so this is this I'm out of players

00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:44,030
online contended that what this is but

00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:49,700
this is all data on various Pokemon

00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:52,250
characters and how they evolve and but

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,840
it's a very very cool app for substance

00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,270
of what i want to show you in terms of

00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:00,020
power friends the way is just thing well

00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:02,330
it is first of all it doesn't look like

00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:07,460
a web page busted I've been searching

00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:09,830
near and find items look into them I'm

00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:13,280
not there's no URL it feels like I've

00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:15,110
been enough as i am going to know so i'm

00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:19,160
in annapolis built our web technologies

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:20,900
so the main web page here you can see

00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,010
how these things are being loaded it's

00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,140
probably her from where you're sitting

00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:27,830
but it tells me here who initiated this

00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:32,419
so the index HTML page that's running

00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:34,970
came from service worker so did make Jas

00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:42,679
and on

00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:50,510
from the service worker if I do this by

00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:53,590
turn off my Wi-Fi and reload this I'm

00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,590
going to define switch networks

00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,230
Michael offline

00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:20,100
so this is an impossible thing of the

00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,740
web when I cook like the idea that you

00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:25,470
would be able to completely work with an

00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,260
app for you have zero network but here I

00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,270
could do that because all these things

00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:34,160
are being programmatically used up

00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:34,160
service workers and capital one

00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,990
this

00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:43,600
so this app is really interesting built

00:33:41,739 --> 00:33:46,450
by a guy named Nolan Lawson and he did

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,220
it as a experiment on most or uh as a

00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,499
demonstration happen it's perfect for

00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:54,580
that because of the number of things

00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:56,590
that it shows off so all of the shell of

00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,539
the path that you're seeing is being

00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,759
served out of service workers casual

00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:02,979
service workers I showed you all the

00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:04,809
content like all of those characters

00:34:02,979 --> 00:34:08,589
their attributes all the things about

00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:13,440
them are inside index TV and he's using

00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:16,329
web workers to render the UI so he is

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,159
generating the visuals for this on a

00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:20,200
background thread and then sending off

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,299
changes dip changes back of the main

00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,159
threat which why it is so smooth like if

00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:25,869
you're flailing it on your phone it

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,369
really feels good like 60 frames a

00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:29,589
second is pretty easy for this thing to

00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:31,839
achieve because it does most of its work

00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:34,030
on a background worker thread and it

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,629
uses all of the i/o for the database is

00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,629
done Rebecca

00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,410
this is the architecture opponent

00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:46,410
parking mode so he's using a web worker

00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:50,700
and a virtual dog in other words he has

00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:53,790
he's constructed inside the worker the

00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:55,710
same dog that is up here but he does all

00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:58,440
of his operations on this and then he

00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:00,300
sends a patcher it is a different pouch

00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:04,040
to tell what to apply to the main

00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,040
dresses compromise is really smoothly

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,750
this is another one that I'm not going

00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,130
to run up do it that book now but you

00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,079
want to play with it Google just put

00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:14,060
this one out and is I have a kind of a

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,650
fun thing it lets you throw and catch

00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,119
paper airplanes of people around the

00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,650
world it's got lots of music and so on

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,670
and so i'm not going to show it to you

00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:27,320
right now but it's an interesting clip

00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:29,359
this one gear flipkart.com so this is

00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:33,740
one of india's largest e-commerce sites

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:38,180
and in 2015 they shut down their website

00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:40,400
and they moved to mobilize they said

00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,480
we're not going to do Taco Bell the same

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,339
thing lots of people have said this

00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,690
we're going to shut down our website and

00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:47,329
we're only going to do native apps

00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:49,820
because people want me to us but that

00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:51,680
didn't work because people didn't want

00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,690
to install her up so they found that

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,070
sixty-three percent of their users reach

00:35:53,690 --> 00:36:00,650
the site on 2g networks to run slow slow

00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,690
devices slow networks and so caching

00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,640
doing before

00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:05,860
and they found that once they moved to a

00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,960
progressive web and people could add

00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,610
this thing to their home screen so this

00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,010
one looks like when you want to try and

00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:17,110
add one of these apps to your home

00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:19,840
stream that they had a sixty percent of

00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:22,120
all flipkart users now come from people

00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,250
watching this progressive web app from

00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,420
the Home screen so it's a really

00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,610
interesting thing because they haven't

00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:30,670
got rid of their native apps you have

00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:34,380
hybrid approach where you will cry out

00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:34,380
what Kirk and I have it running

00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:41,050
the fur

00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:43,240
people can try this out and again it was

00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:44,560
just like a nap or if you wanted to

00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,590
download I think this one doesn't

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:52,320
shoaling for it but you know being able

00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:55,060
to install the native app or a shop here

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,680
that this thing is just it's a great

00:36:55,060 --> 00:37:01,000
experience for using an e-commerce site

00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,410
and again you can play with it but the

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,790
fact that you can play with it not

00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:08,640
installed in like I got amazon

00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:11,310
I just aliens on a for example I tend to

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,730
think about going through website why is

00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:16,170
that I don't want to put pants on icon

00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,330
on my home screen like it's not

00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:20,850
important enough to be on a daily basis

00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:22,740
for to either but a URL like this is

00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:24,540
something that I could decide over time

00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,710
you know what I am using this all the

00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,320
times we're going to I'm going to

00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:30,560
promote this up to my chest up it's not

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,560
a big deal

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,609
this is an example of a push

00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:39,559
notification so imagine you registered

00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:42,230
for some product that you're interested

00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:43,910
in and price goes down and that web up

00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,470
come back to you and say well there's

00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,299
been a price drop in this lady you are

00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:49,670
interested in click here to go and look

00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:50,930
at it and purchase it now so this is

00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:53,839
something that's happening on the lock

00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:55,940
screen there's no browser persons not

00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:59,960
running the app right so it's a way to

00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:03,349
reengage here's another one this is

00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,450
housing com so another one from India so

00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:08,599
the leading real estate site in India

00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,950
and they build this progressive web app

00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:12,200
and they saw thirty-eight percent

00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:17,180
increase in conversions so they already

00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:18,740
had I OS and Android apps built but they

00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,990
found that people weren't installing

00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,760
them because they had limited storage on

00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:24,950
their devices so people were mostly

00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,010
using them on low-end devices and they

00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:30,079
couldn't justify saving all of that

00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,970
content onto their device and so they

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,440
just wouldn't install it which I'm not

00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,910
that much different and I have lots of

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,280
space on my device but for whatever

00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:40,039
reason I don't know why we tend your

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,390
garden space you want to use it very

00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:45,040
much but movies there

00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:47,140
so they did a progressive what about and

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,630
again it feels like a nap it is enough

00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:52,690
but they found that people came to it so

00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:54,880
I think people could try the app without

00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,560
installing it and it made it

00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:02,470
frictionless for people to get engaged

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:05,820
with it so this thing running here and

00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:09,030
you're looking for property and my vibe

00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,030
it's good

00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,540
it's an interesting one for

00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:25,510
things like to go look out again for how

00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,510
well business as now

00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:32,079
and of course like a native app like you

00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,340
[Music]

00:39:52,160 --> 00:40:00,590
Washington Post

00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:02,600
they took the paper and first of all

00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:05,330
they found that seventy percent of all

00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,610
traffic to post site is coming from

00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,230
mobile devices which is a nice pickle is

00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:11,030
pretty huge right so they're not going

00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,560
there does topic move from a bomb on

00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:17,300
their community or whatever doesn't

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:20,000
they're doing sixty-three percent of

00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,370
users so seventy percent on phone

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,140
sixty-three percent of those are using

00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:26,570
it from the web and seven percent from

00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:28,250
their native us imagine justify the cost

00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:30,440
of building a native app for your

00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:32,480
platform for only seven percent of your

00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,130
users sometimes I think you could

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,740
sometimes it's important enough to do it

00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:38,930
and it definitely is if you're in the

00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:40,640
top 40 your Facebook for your Instagram

00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:42,170
send Billy a native app makes a lot of

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,330
sense but if you're building something

00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:48,720
that people

00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:51,040
in light rays it's a pretty hard sell so

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,660
they switched over to this progressive

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,990
web up and it had really good success

00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,990
with it and again I have it running

00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:08,570
it's really well done like it again

00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:11,690
feels like that is Washington Post as

00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:14,870
mass installable to your home screen be

00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:15,579
able to do offline access available to

00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:18,959
do first

00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:18,959
that's something that you want

00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:31,819
so I want to end this with a story which

00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:33,109
I thought as I was researching this one

00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:35,539
of the things came across Twitter with a

00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:39,769
terrible story about a developer who

00:41:35,539 --> 00:41:41,329
wrote the dash iOS so I want to talk to

00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:42,650
you about this concept of permission and

00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:45,109
I think one of the things that's most

00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:48,289
important on the web as opposed to app

00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:49,999
store is the fact that via an app stores

00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:52,910
writing code publish any code

00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:55,130
information you need permission from the

00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,259
app store to make an update have a color

00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:59,630
change to use nikon to do with

00:41:57,259 --> 00:42:01,910
absolutely everything and increasingly

00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,559
the permission is need from a person

00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,690
it's an automated system that you can't

00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:07,190
interact with you can't talk to it so

00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:09,259
it's a really weird place here we are

00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,999
talking about open source and there was

00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:12,859
a time when we would have talked about

00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:15,049
open sources desktop software and

00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:18,440
software you install the user but as a

00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:19,759
user installing apps it's very very

00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,810
difficult to think in those terms now

00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:24,970
you are your gated in terms of what you

00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:29,160
developer clear the story of this

00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:29,160
developer people's websites a show you

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,759
um

00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:45,579
so this guy has a popular at the dash

00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:47,529
shop it's for it's essentially a

00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:49,869
documentation browser used by a lot of

00:42:47,529 --> 00:42:51,609
developers and so on and it was very

00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:55,509
popular on desktop one else on mobile

00:42:51,609 --> 00:42:59,139
and when they woke up and it was his

00:42:55,509 --> 00:43:02,199
academy locked for no reason given but

00:42:59,139 --> 00:43:03,759
it was popular enough app that people

00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:07,539
talked about it if people want better

00:43:03,759 --> 00:43:09,189
than that how to respond to it yes they

00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:10,989
went back before trying to figure out a

00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:14,769
reason and they eventually accused him

00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:16,599
of doing a fixing reviews like

00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:19,179
interfering with reviews of the app and

00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:21,279
the iOS store and they did more research

00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:23,289
and he realized that at one point he had

00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:25,719
used his credit card to help a family

00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:26,299
member get their Apple system set up an

00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:28,999
apple

00:43:26,299 --> 00:43:31,309
somehow linked those two accounts so for

00:43:28,999 --> 00:43:32,719
whatever reason in Apple's mine whatever

00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:35,299
had happened with this other account

00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:37,249
many years hence came the influx what's

00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:39,439
happening with his account I'll check

00:43:37,249 --> 00:43:41,479
out this app that people are paid for

00:43:39,439 --> 00:43:43,969
that he has on the iOS tourists have

00:43:41,479 --> 00:43:45,890
gone there's nothing he gives you so he

00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:48,410
has to find another channel there is no

00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:51,589
other channel on an iOS bias currently

00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:53,890
to do this except the web I think that

00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:57,079
one of the most important things about

00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:59,989
the potential for doing apps and using

00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:03,640
the web is that the web is a permission

00:43:59,989 --> 00:44:06,920
lyst platform I don't need to have

00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:09,079
Google or Apple or whoever it is let me

00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,969
into their store I just need to put

00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:13,549
something up that's reachable through

00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:17,089
URL so even continue want to built this

00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:18,769
stuff using the web the absolutely shut

00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:20,929
down in terms of the Aastra they have a

00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:23,650
terrible our course I think I think

00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:26,359
about open source we think about access

00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:27,979
really keeping your eye on what's

00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:31,680
possible with web apps because I think

00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:34,920
web apps would put a crack into those

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,030
in terms of allowing you to get anyway I

00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,800
really want to talk to you about

00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:40,619
innovation on phones and so on so I

00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,109
thank you for thank you tell you both

00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:45,180
progressive web apps now just a lot of

00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:46,680
this stuff in very very new you may be

00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,780
using some of it without knowing it

00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,030
because people are slowly rolling up its

00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,680
b-side but if you're building any kind

00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:55,410
of web detector I would encourage you to

00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,270
look at look at service workers look at

00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:59,309
the caching api's look at the storage it

00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:00,960
guys because they let you just do things

00:44:59,309 --> 00:45:05,390
you could not dream up when we first

00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,390
started cooking anyway thanks very much

00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:24,460
just by two

00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:32,700
progressive web apps and hi mommy

00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,080
brightness so ionic is great I mention

00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:37,350
at the beginning there's been various

00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,270
attempts to use web technologies

00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,920
essentially buildings with web

00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:43,530
technologies and then ship them into

00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:47,910
these native app store so technologies

00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:50,390
like ionic what they allow you to do

00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:53,790
adobe has to us Adobe's version of it

00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:56,220
fedora what is a cult film full nap oh

00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:58,590
yeah Koga so these are great

00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:01,890
technologies I can build using web apps

00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:04,470
and they essentially give me a an API

00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:06,750
and often an extended API to do things

00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:09,000
like interact with the contacts interact

00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:10,680
with other parts of the phone and then

00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,990
what I've done they package it up as a

00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,760
native app it's a native app with pieces

00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:16,440
of it better have web contents that are

00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,690
running inside it and you can put that

00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,760
in the web store so if your goal is to

00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:23,070
if your goal is to get into the web

00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:26,070
store I think that's still a really good

00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:28,110
target way to do it because these apps

00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:31,440
for example they don't they're going to

00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:34,650
be in the web store they're designed to

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,900
be like something before that something

00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:40,050
a lighter touch way of trying something

00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,850
out so you may decide to do an ionic gap

00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,620
that's installed into the web store and

00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:46,140
a progressive web app as a way for

00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,970
people to try it because most people to

00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:50,730
get you to the installation page don't

00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:52,650
get installed on up you'll know that no

00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:54,720
one here installed subway sandwich up

00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:57,960
today it's right the fact that I told

00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:03,000
you it exists sob so people are hesitant

00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:04,110
to do it I think that's one thing yeah

00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,410
another question is

00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:09,170
could I just defuse the angularjs to

00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:12,020
realize this technology

00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:15,410
could you use angular yeah yes so people

00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:16,730
are using react angular this is not one

00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:18,710
of the things I like about this is you

00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:21,589
don't have to commit to a framework or

00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:24,049
set of libraries or whatever what you're

00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:25,930
doing is you're essentially just using

00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:28,970
the infrastructure of the browser to

00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:31,309
deal with Network loss and cashing in

00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:33,079
another programmer but what you how you

00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:35,000
build your app is totally up to you so

00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:36,559
if you have an investment in angular do

00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,650
you want to use angular to do all this

00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:41,900
you absolutely and in fact that's

00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:43,280
probably a great way to do it because so

00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,740
much of the app like way of building

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:52,010
that of the state management etc you can

00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:54,589
use server and load is to access the

00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:57,440
way of accessing the resources or API is

00:47:54,589 --> 00:48:00,300
provided by the name

00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,210
is that an invitation of this type of

00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:06,090
well so that's part of the progressive

00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:09,630
aspect 54 recipe handsome so for example

00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:12,120
Google is in the latest version from

00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:15,060
their shipping weapons that's very new

00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:17,040
in iOS doesn't shipping yet Mozilla

00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:19,500
hasn't implemented it yet so you have a

00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,810
lie so if you really need to gain access

00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:24,060
to native aged guys and something like a

00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:25,920
line maybe a better way to go there

00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,810
isn't a reason to use native app

00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,030
sometimes sometimes you want to take

00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:31,590
advantage of native aspects of the

00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:33,420
device that you're on but if you're

00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:36,510
trying to show all that are for sale in

00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,620
Mumbai you don't need access to you know

00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:39,750
typically you don't need access to

00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:41,490
native aspects of the phone what you

00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,990
need to do is need to render experience

00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:44,910
to the users they can or interact with

00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:46,260
so I think it's going to depend on if

00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:48,600
you're building a game that needs to

00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:50,760
unlock something that's very specific to

00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,040
the device you're on the native is

00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,770
spilled a way to go but if it's not then

00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:57,890
this becomes an interesting with an

00:48:55,770 --> 00:49:00,550
interesting experiment

00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:00,550
MC

00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:09,390
they tried to make sure that the

00:49:06,019 --> 00:49:11,100
look no further

00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:13,440
if they don't so this is your point

00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:17,970
about using angular or they don't care

00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:20,460
like these technologies just serve CSS

00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:21,960
HTML images but it's up to you to decide

00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,150
what they should look like so if you

00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:27,360
want to know you have the option because

00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:29,880
without droid everett version 3 divides

00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:32,160
a little different something so it's one

00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,550
something looks native there's a lot of

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,550
work left

00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:41,230
yeah does it look baby bear both know

00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,700
they're they're not these are low-level

00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:45,190
api's that aren't thinking in those

00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:47,380
terms it would still be on you too like

00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,780
for example that manifest JSON that I

00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:51,550
showed you you'd have to have

00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:53,260
appropriate size and resolution icons

00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:55,120
for every platform that you're on it's

00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,650
like it's still a mess you still have to

00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:59,590
deal with fragmentation of all these

00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:01,510
different platforms but you have a

00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:04,180
mechanism for doing that so I can load

00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:07,540
and cash the SS that I need if I move or

00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:09,820
my phone to my tablet I can download

00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:11,740
other bits of the app that I now need

00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:14,080
that I didn't need or we love showing

00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:15,400
other parts of you I you know it's there

00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,910
are ways to deal with that but this

00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,910
doesn't address

00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:25,910
the 25 to that example Austin's a pond

00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,760
but I get moved to everybody like to do

00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,680
I'm not Kiki and I do anything with

00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,830
technology talk about here he invested

00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:40,200
heavily iOS Mac and so on he got bitten

00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:42,060
by it I'm not trying I mean I'm here on

00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,490
an apple laptop I love Apple hardware

00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:46,619
and also my google phone so I'm it's the

00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:48,780
best of both worlds right but I'm not

00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:51,180
telling you shouldn't use Apple but I'm

00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,980
saying there is cost the permission

00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:55,020
model of the job stores right but here's

00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:59,250
the first to say it was before he was a

00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:01,200
fight that was fun well again he's out

00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,970
these things exist so the webcam in API

00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,520
for example something has just landed in

00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:06,520
both

00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,020
in android/ios you know from your phone

00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:09,490
being able to pay for things I thought

00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:12,100
actually says people have a perception

00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:14,530
that apps

00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:18,900
but I'll pay for that people will say

00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,900
yeah I'll pay a dollar to five dollars

00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:25,310
well how does that compare with a

00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,710
paywall people

00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:28,330
hey k

00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:30,220
I mean I think the things that you're

00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:31,300
talking about are beyond the technology

00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,099
like it's a really interesting question

00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,630
but I don't think these technologies

00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:37,119
have anything to say about it I could

00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:39,070
charge movies or I could not charge like

00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,410
Washington Post could close it down and

00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:43,000
make it harder to access it you can sell

00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:44,589
me out you can sell a subscription

00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,950
there's a lot of different models you

00:51:44,589 --> 00:51:49,330
can go go but if you look at most of the

00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:53,680
ops on your home treated you came

00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:55,630
through like you didn't pick up directly

00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,930
if you're paying google and facebook

00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:04,300
with your data like your your product

00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:05,800
but the oxen free right so anyway I

00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:11,670
should probably not stand in the way the

00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:11,670
front lunch so enjoy 52 thanks very much

00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:24,210
