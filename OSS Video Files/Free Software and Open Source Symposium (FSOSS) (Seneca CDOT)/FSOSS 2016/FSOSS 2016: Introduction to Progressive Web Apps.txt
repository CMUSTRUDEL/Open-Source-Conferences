Publication date: 2016-11-25
Playlist: FSOSS 2016
Description: 
	Speaker: David Humphrey, Professor with Seneca College

Over the past decade, the dominant computing platform has switched to mobile. With this shift we've seen an erosion of open source's influence on user's lives, with greater platform control from dominant vendors, and especially in user applications: apps have been built with native, proprietary technologies. However, the open web hasn't gone away. While people don't install thousands (or even dozens) of apps, they do visit thousands of web pages. Progressive Web Apps (PWA) combine the best of the native platform with the best of the open web, creating experiences that can be installed, used offline, enjoyed on different sized devices, and accessed across vendor platforms. "Progressive Web Apps" is an umbrella term that refers to many existing and emerging technologies, best practices, and approaches. This talk will introduce the main concepts and show how to build a PWA.
