thank you there's a lot of people here

00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:13,629
that's the kind of scary hasn't this

00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,039
been a great conference I've really

00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:16,930
enjoyed the number of different ideas

00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,750
that have come up and the ways those

00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,990
ideas interact with each other we were

00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:25,300
talking about the Internet of Things a

00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,189
little bit earlier and my take on the

00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,470
Internet of Things was the implications

00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:34,810
for analytics that would go on but the

00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:36,850
the notion that the anything suppose the

00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,010
internet needs to be updated and nobody

00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,530
really wants to do that I thought that

00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,149
was really interesting and in my talk

00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,730
we're just opening the door on a new

00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:47,440
technology and I I actually believe that

00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,180
there's a world of unintended

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,100
consequences that we're only starting to

00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:55,600
we're only starting to think about so

00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:58,090
that was an interesting thing um okay

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,190
this isn't very visual I've only got a

00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,170
couple of things to show you so I want

00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,330
you to I to think about the last time

00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,640
you used your credit card online last

00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:10,119
time you made a payment online for me I

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,979
end up going to Amazon way too often but

00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:13,540
you basically you're putting in the same

00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:16,720
kind of information that you put in on a

00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:19,840
credit card transaction and that that

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,450
type of transaction was happening in the

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,950
40s actually they stamp your name and

00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,770
account number on a little piece of

00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,320
metal put a little piece of cardboard in

00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:32,290
the back for your signature when I was a

00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,939
kid you're working at a gas station we

00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:39,460
had plastic then I'm not that old and

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:42,939
but basically the transaction that you

00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,799
do on Amazon is fundamentally very

00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:48,969
similar from something you would have

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:52,930
done in the 1940s with what was then the

00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:55,240
precursor of credit cards and the the

00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,860
important thing about that is it needs

00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,009
to be encrypted because what you provide

00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,200
is everything needed to charge your

00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:04,750
account some arbitrary amount of money

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,719
so it needs be encrypted and sent to

00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,789
their to the merchant and they send it

00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:11,230
to their payment processor and they send

00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,970
it to their bank who sends it to their

00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,190
credit card company who signs it to your

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,670
bank and each party along the way needs

00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,280
to encrypt it and by and large they do

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,989
and only seldom only once in a while or

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,180
you know 100 million accounts tall but

00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:30,030
but fundamentally what you're encrypting

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,010
and what you're putting into that into

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,610
that transaction is very sensitive

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:38,130
because it's the keys to your account so

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,410
now what I'm going to try to do is to

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,920
introduce and talk about another I

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,230
another option and so I'm going to come

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,390
back to it and try to introduce one idea

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,090
at a time the first idea is going to be

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,720
the basic transaction and so what we're

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:59,220
going to do is we are going to imagine

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,860
having a public ledger so there are many

00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,380
entries on that ledger and you have the

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,140
key for some previous amount that's on

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,720
that ledger that you are able to spend

00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:14,790
that will be identified on the public

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:17,910
ledger with a public key and so what you

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,580
can do to make a transaction to Amazon

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,850
is you will ask them if I'm paying you I

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,320
will ask you for a public key to which I

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,739
should send you a certain amount of

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,019
money so i will create a transaction i

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,180
will use the public key that you gave me

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,489
the amount that you gave me and i will

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,859
refer to a previous transaction that had

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,540
at least that amount and then give some

00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,359
change to myself so I'll make my own

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,060
public key for the change and that's the

00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:47,100
basic form of it because you are giving

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,880
me a public key anybody can see that and

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,709
they will on the ledger also because

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,060
everything is going to be public we're

00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:55,650
not going to really want to use our own

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,870
name we're going to want to use

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,540
something that's not easy to understand

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,190
so basically all of these keys are going

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,190
to look really abstract that are on the

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:08,390
public ledger and then at the end of the

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,709
transaction I use a private key that

00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,709
corresponds to the previously published

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:16,950
transaction to sign the new transaction

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,450
and that will create a transaction that

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,710
he can spend and then I'll be able to

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,810
spend the chain and nothing that goes is

00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:26,729
published is private you keep your

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,130
private keys I keep my private keys

00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:31,169
every time you use an account and the

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,729
account numbers aren't

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,710
they don't go on forever they're used

00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:37,560
once and then they go and the next time

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:41,310
you you accept money you give somebody a

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,099
new public key because keys are cheap

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,259
they're really just big numbers and

00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:48,120
they're so big that you can come up with

00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:54,439
water and we're going to get into how

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,439
you create those keys in a minute sorry

00:04:55,099 --> 00:05:01,469
okay so that is the public key what I

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,939
want to do today I'm not I'm going to go

00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:06,810
through really quickly on an

00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:08,520
introduction to took cryptography really

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,169
quick I just want to give you a sense of

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,479
how it works and why it works so that

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:14,849
you can kind of understand that a gut

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,879
level that it's it's not as hokey is

00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:22,710
sometimes sounds how many people have

00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:24,870
any form of Bitcoin or athyrium or even

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:30,360
I test that token does anybody have any

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:36,529
ok so if maybe four or five um and so

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:39,120
this is starting to to be used um and

00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:40,169
for people who are experts I apologize

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,110
in advance because this is going to be

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:44,610
really basic and then we're going to go

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,529
through the development of the ideas and

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,539
we're going to we're going to talk about

00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:52,379
schemes that people have for future

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:54,870
plans and and and we'll be able to kind

00:05:52,379 --> 00:06:00,360
of assess what the pros and cons oh

00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:03,330
those are okay so I want to go through

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,979
just three I think ideas about

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,699
cryptography just so you get a sense of

00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:11,069
it and the math because I've been a

00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,659
programmer for a long time we won't

00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:14,300
worry about how long but I've been a

00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:16,889
programmer for a long time and

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,439
cryptography always seemed mysterious

00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:21,120
and like the domain of only really super

00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,939
smart people and so when I kind of

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,319
started to figure out some of it and I

00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,939
realized that actually you can

00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,279
understand the basics and they're quite

00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:31,800
accessible that was real eye-opener for

00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:36,330
me so I want to hopefully share that

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,159
insight with you so and each of these

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,779
steps that I'm going to take is is small

00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:43,330
it's going to be it's going to be really

00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:46,000
understandable i hope so

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,490
first of all one of the key ideas in

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,979
cryptography is the idea of irreversible

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,050
math and that seems a little bit weird

00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:55,300
because most of the map that first comes

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,560
to mind is perfectly reversible you know

00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,270
addition and subtraction and

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,960
multiplication you can reverse that very

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:04,240
easily I if you take if you do division

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,159
and you get a modulus that is not easily

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,599
reversible but you kind of tend not to

00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:12,189
think about that because I often you do

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,259
do you do that so reversible maths first

00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:15,940
thing how many people are familiar with

00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:17,770
hash functions I think a lot of people

00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,690
here should be is anybody really

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,710
uncomfortable with hash functions is not

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:26,710
familiar at all okay okay that's

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,270
basically most people I so it is so I'm

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,909
just going to go really quickly through

00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,889
that they're really fun is one of these

00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:36,009
things that come sometimes programmers

00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:37,990
have this weakness of algorithms make

00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:42,729
you feel smart Nash functions are one of

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:45,159
them so on at any rate if you have a

00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,930
hash function you can have anything that

00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:49,719
goes into it you'll get something out of

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,090
it you will always get the same output

00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:54,009
if you use the same input so it's always

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,500
it's deterministic that's the first

00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,599
thing the second thing is it's

00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,659
indistinguishable from random that's

00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:04,089
actually important in this case so if

00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:05,349
you have two outputs you should not be

00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:07,089
able to tell the difference between

00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:09,669
random numbers and the output of the

00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:12,159
hash function and it should be difficult

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:14,469
to find two different inputs that create

00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:17,889
the same hash it's inevitable but it

00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:23,139
should be difficult so given that hash

00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:25,029
function the next basic idea is the axe

00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:27,279
or and I'm going to expect that once

00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:29,949
again most people are familiar with XR

00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:32,829
so my summaries can be super quick if

00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:35,680
you take an input and you XOR it with

00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:38,949
something a random looking you'll get

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,050
something else random looking and the

00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:42,909
magical thing about the XOR is it's like

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,339
super reversible because if you take

00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:47,079
that output and you XOR it against the

00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,510
same random looking thing you'll get

00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:52,510
your original input back and so that if

00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:54,399
you can imagine is really handy for

00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,930
cryptography because if you can create

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,240
something that is consistent

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,430
random you XOR it with your input and

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,080
now you can send it somebody as long as

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,440
they can create the same random looking

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:10,210
input they can decrypt and that's the

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,860
key to the diffie-hellman key exchange

00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:17,029
and I'm going to kind of celebrate that

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:19,580
a little bit does anybody know who won

00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:26,020
the Turing award this year the Turing

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:32,360
award nobody that's disappointing defeat

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:34,010
diffie-hellman said it ok diffie and

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,680
hellman when the Turing award this year

00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:40,250
and I'm just going to take a super

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,709
simplified view of what it is that they

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,930
invented because it's what allows you to

00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,279
share secrets to to encrypt something to

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:51,649
somebody you've never shared secret

00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:53,240
before so here we get to the silly

00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:55,040
numbers that I had on the screen here a

00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:00,040
minute ago I don't know if that's going

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,630
to wake up so we have two numbers here

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,580
we're going to consider for a moment the

00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:08,660
universe of numbers between one and

00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:15,950
eight thousand 147 and we are going to

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:19,040
consider exponents of 251 so what you're

00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:20,900
going to do is who's good at coming up

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,940
with random numbers can you come up with

00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:32,779
a number between one and eight thousand

00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:36,350
147 to 549 alright so what we're going

00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:41,589
to do is we're going to take 251 and you

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:41,589
can't read this because it's super small

00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:55,760
what was it 2541 549 ok so what we're

00:10:53,149 --> 00:11:02,420
doing is we're taking the number 251 and

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:03,990
raising it to the power of 2549 you

00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,410
probably can't read that

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:11,040
it's a big number now the next step in

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,510
the diffie-hellman key exchange remember

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:18,300
that we were going to consider the

00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:23,100
universe of numbers between one and

00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:26,250
eight thousand so 200 549 so that gives

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:31,980
us so what we're going to use is your

00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:33,950
public key is going to be 7360 and I'm

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:39,690
going to suggest that this algorithm of

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:44,430
taking the exponent a 251 to the power

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:46,920
of 2549 and then taking the modulus of

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:49,830
that I'm going to suggest that that is

00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,440
not reversible because you would have to

00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,360
guess the modulus that shows up here and

00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,490
you can't get any other digits wrong or

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,649
else it just won't work close to is no

00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:02,790
good so that's the key to what makes

00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:07,920
this operation bizarrely simple and yet

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:11,640
completely um irreversible so we have

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,200
his paw up his private key is the number

00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:17,540
that you came up with the public key

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:20,459
that you can tell anybody is 700 306

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:24,450
7360 you can come up with another number

00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:26,730
like that and you can calculate a shared

00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:29,370
secret by using his public key and

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,649
raising it to your private key the

00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,810
number that you just imagine you raise

00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:36,240
that and then you take the modulus you

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:40,140
can publish your public key he can take

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,640
your public key raise it and raise it to

00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,670
the power of his private key two

00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:49,020
thousand whatever it was then he takes

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:51,120
the modulus 8,000 147 and he'll get a

00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,470
number between 8,000 and you're both

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,870
going to have the same number and

00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:57,570
anybody any of the rest of us who are

00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,520
intercepting that will not be able to do

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:02,579
the calculation because we cannot

00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:06,390
reverse that calculation there we can't

00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:09,020
yes at what his or is private key is

00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:13,740
because that's so difficult to reverse

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:17,000
and so that's actually that and can

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,000
somebody see the problem with this

00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:23,779
it's problem well that's that's a

00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:30,379
problem true yeah how about another

00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:31,759
problem yes the key exchange that's

00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:41,679
basically similar to the man in the

00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:46,629
middle well that is the expectation of

00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:49,699
of cryptography before this this

00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:53,899
algorithm came up that you need to share

00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:55,609
a secret in order to be able to to

00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:58,279
create that random list that will be

00:13:55,609 --> 00:14:00,349
consistent between you and the magic of

00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:03,259
what diff Ian Hellman did is by saying

00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:05,329
by taking a private key and raising it

00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:08,539
to a power of some crazy other number

00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:10,279
and then taking a modulus you can share

00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:13,069
something and it's so hard to reverse it

00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:16,339
despite the fact that the public key can

00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:17,569
be seen by anybody and you need a secure

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:18,799
enough connection to actually get it

00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:21,079
through so you don't have man in the

00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,079
middle that's true that's legitimate but

00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:27,399
if you can get it through then you can

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,009
calculate a common shared secret and

00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:32,989
everybody can see your communication and

00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:41,629
so you can now encrypt but nobody will

00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:49,549
be able to get your shared secret you

00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:54,139
both you exactly yes you both publish

00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:56,479
your public keys in this case the public

00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:59,209
key is seven is 70 whatever I can take

00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:01,699
that 70 whatever raise it to my private

00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:02,989
key you don't know my pocket to you can

00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:04,789
see the public key but you can't

00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:06,919
calculate his private key from that

00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:10,039
because you can't reverse it so that's

00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:12,349
the key to it and at the time this is a

00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:14,509
very simple trick but it solves a neat

00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:16,429
problem and actually there are a few

00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:19,189
things the other one other problem you

00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:22,869
have with this is that in this number

00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:22,869
range it would be very easy to just

00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:29,080
sorry what

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:31,490
exactly you can try every number and so

00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,560
the problem we have with these big

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,390
numbers is that becomes infeasible in

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,709
this case was infeasible to reverse so

00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:42,440
what you want to do is you want to get a

00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:44,089
number universe that is so difficult it

00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,220
would be difficult to go through all the

00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:49,310
numbers so in this case we solved half

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:52,670
of the problem we didn't have we didn't

00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:55,459
have a number space big enough to to

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:59,300
prevent that if we're using the scheme

00:15:55,459 --> 00:16:02,060
in anger we would use bigger numbers for

00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,160
me this was an insight because even with

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,130
numbers that are semi manageable like

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,990
8,000 we still get results that are so

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:12,500
crazy big that you can really understand

00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:15,079
how this is not reversible and then

00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,060
there are a bunch of other problems I'm

00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:20,240
going to suggest that what we've covered

00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,190
is kind of the nub of it things like man

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,820
in the middle of are important

00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:28,220
considerations there are a few other

00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:36,730
attacks that you have to cover basically

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:40,100
by being super careful yeah yeah yeah

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:43,070
yeah your your computing time gets up

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,420
and if you're worried particularly if

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,880
you're worried about quantum computing

00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,490
you start coming up into a scheme where

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,750
you just really big numbers and you

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,670
actually make life difficult for

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,560
yourself hopefully you're making life

00:16:52,670 --> 00:17:00,050
super difficult for an attacker but you

00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:01,880
know whatever at any rate so we went

00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,220
over some of the basic technology when

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,919
diffie-hellman came up with this

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,329
algorithm they expected that one what

00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:10,400
you would be able to do in the future is

00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:11,990
have a similar algorithm of similar

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,559
complexity where you would take a

00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:17,990
document take the hash of it and then do

00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:21,079
a transformation of similar complexity

00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:25,189
on that hash and and then that could be

00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:29,540
validated by using your public key as a

00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:31,730
signature and and that did happen and

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,340
then there's another algorithm that was

00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,290
more complex that came out this calmly

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,669
is the elliptic curve

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:41,520
but the first one actually even took

00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:43,830
about eight years and the funny thing

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,049
about that is even when you have your

00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,309
hands right around the fact you have a

00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:49,380
really good idea that there is a

00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:50,850
solution sometimes it actually takes a

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,450
while for somebody to come up with it

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:58,679
and that's the next step we're going to

00:17:54,450 --> 00:18:00,630
get into with digital transactions this

00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:04,309
kind of a scheme where you have a public

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:07,710
ledger and you sign transactions is

00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:10,890
clearly a more natural fit for the

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,299
internet and as such it's the kind of

00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:16,230
thing that a lot of people have been

00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:18,929
trying to do for a long time can anybody

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:27,270
tell me when the first digital currency

00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:31,549
was started yes yes many people would

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:34,080
say 2008 and not actually be correct

00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:36,150
David ciam I think was one of the first

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,559
one of the innovators he came up with a

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,110
scheme and he actually sold it to a

00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,520
couple of banks and what he would do is

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,100
you'd make an arrangement with your bank

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,429
you'd have a number that was kind of

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,860
semi public and you could use it with a

00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:51,720
certain amount of anonymity and then

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:57,030
they could go back but it had to go

00:18:51,720 --> 00:19:01,320
through the bank between 1990 and about

00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:04,230
2008 there was about 100 other attempts

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,210
to create a digital currency and the

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:09,600
thing I find interesting about that is I

00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:11,520
always try to be very careful if a lot

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,650
of other people a lot of other smart

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,230
people have tried a problem and have

00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,210
failed I I should respect that and

00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,650
understand that it's not going to

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:23,070
necessarily be easy for me to overcome

00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:25,919
that so if you can imagine like coming

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,870
up with you know digital currency number

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,330
68 when there's been many failures

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:33,390
before and some of these failures are by

00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:35,730
companies like Visa Visa had a scheme

00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,080
citibank had a scheme that they were

00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:43,590
trying to put forward and these did not

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:48,659
succeed so in 2008 we had the paper that

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:49,680
initiated Bitcoin and and there's two

00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:52,230
innovations that are going to

00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,860
I'm going to focus on with that one of

00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:57,240
them just barely predates that Hashcash

00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,190
and that kind of established the

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,270
structure that bitcoin ultimately used

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:05,220
with hash clash you would take it up

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:07,200
basically the same form of transaction

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,030
that we talked about already you

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,360
basically use digital transaction

00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:14,190
digital signatures and and you publish

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,830
that for a transaction you take a group

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:20,070
of them into a small table you take a

00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:23,070
hash of that now the hash of that will

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,750
be used in a block header the block

00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,660
header will have that it will have the

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:31,770
hash of the previous block header and it

00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:33,930
will have a couple other things and so

00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,280
each block refers to the previous block

00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:39,030
includes a whole bunch of new

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:44,160
transactions and that was the scheme of

00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:46,740
of hash bash and it was structurally

00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:50,250
pretty solid but it didn't really get

00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:52,820
started the thing that bitcoin added was

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:56,730
the idea of adding to that header a

00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:59,190
random number sometimes innovations are

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:01,830
oddly simple you add a random number and

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:04,320
you keep repeating that operation until

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,240
you get a hash that is below a certain

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,780
threshold so it starts with a bunch of

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:13,320
zeros or it is a smaller number and what

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:15,780
that allows you to do is allows many

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:19,500
people to operate the system and work

00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:21,030
together and that the key there is that

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:26,670
it's distributed it's like the internet

00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:29,340
many people are enabling it and and then

00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,810
in the beginning of the transit in the

00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,400
beginning of the list of transactions

00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:36,300
the minor pays themselves so he has

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:42,630
incentive which are pretty small changes

00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:44,940
to that but that the next step of course

00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,540
is is the is the kind of social

00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,520
implications and that's where actually

00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:53,010
people who have a good understanding of

00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,950
open source technologies I think

00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:57,600
actually have a huge advantage I think a

00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:03,510
lot of people who are looking at this

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:04,530
kind of space it's it's hard not to

00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,680
approach it with a certain amount of

00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,660
greed but you know that's that's a real

00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,030
thing and it's also something you

00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,730
anticipate you know if you're looking at

00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:16,670
somebody putting this you know even

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,200
citibank you know putting forward this

00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,580
digital currency scheme you kind of

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,070
expect that they're not going to be very

00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,290
altruistic and how they operate it or

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,280
even fair I mean if you have any dispute

00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,280
you don't really know that they're going

00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,560
to be fair and some people that people

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,110
don't necessarily remember is the

00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:37,170
establishment of the new york stock

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,760
exchange was established through the

00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,860
Buttonwood agreement which was an

00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,590
agreement between 24 stockbrokers and

00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:46,350
the idea is there are enough people that

00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:48,300
you could kind of you wouldn't have too

00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,740
much favoritism for one that they could

00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,190
all believe in the system and of course

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:55,650
they they go forward and in an

00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,360
institution that is kind of central to

00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:00,600
capitalism as an area where we kind of

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,850
forget that in order to buy in in the

00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,790
first place they had to actually work

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:08,730
pretty hard at convincing everybody that

00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:12,930
the group was going to be fair and and

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:16,880
that concept is is a real theme here a

00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:19,950
real recurring theme the the concept of

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,290
cultivating a community and I think

00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:27,180
actually in this space it may be harder

00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:29,760
than it would be in most spaces so

00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:35,750
there's there's that the other another

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:39,840
thing that is kind of a community level

00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:42,720
consideration the idea of open

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,570
permission 'less innovation when you

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,360
when the internet was new you and and

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:50,910
even today you can start a web page you

00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,880
don't really need anybody significant

00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:57,870
permission to start it and create some

00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:59,640
new idea and get it going and and that's

00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,770
a really important concept because it

00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,530
means the people with with new ideas who

00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:06,720
don't have an establishment behind them

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,910
don't have to convince some large

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,770
organization that they're to move their

00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:12,180
idea forward they can basically do it

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,920
themselves and if they can find other

00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:16,179
people who are interested in it they can

00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:19,379
push it forward

00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:24,580
and and schemes like the scheme from

00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:27,789
citibank we're not open and so the this

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:30,220
whole idea is not relevant unless many

00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:33,940
people use it and unless many people use

00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:35,440
it for four completely new things one of

00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:40,409
the features of that the basic

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:44,289
transaction excuse me is it is viable

00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:46,659
for a larger range of values if you're

00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:49,659
using credit card transaction you're

00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:51,340
probably spending you know the bottom

00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:53,320
end of the range might be ten dollars or

00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:56,350
thereabouts-- might be the top end might

00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,990
be a thousand you might use it for more

00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:02,950
or less but odds are most of the credit

00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:05,200
card transactions are in that range for

00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,659
a digital currency you could easily see

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,049
using a tenth of a penny or a hundredth

00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:13,659
of a penny and you could probably go to

00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:16,720
a hundred thousand dollars now without

00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:20,320
you know because the the transaction

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,860
itself is really cheap you're just

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,470
publishing a few bits and it's quite

00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,850
secure because you don't have to encode

00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:30,749
something you don't have to trust a

00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:34,330
bunch of other parties to to keep their

00:25:30,749 --> 00:25:38,379
security so the potential range is

00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:40,029
bigger and that means that there's an

00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:42,340
opportunity for a lot of new

00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:44,919
applications to use that kind of

00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:49,690
technology and in order for that to

00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:53,049
happen that that needs to be allowed the

00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:55,690
idea of open permission lyst innovation

00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:59,080
of having somebody just come up with an

00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:03,129
idea and be able to try it out and build

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:05,049
something is very important and so i

00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:09,190
think going forward those those kind of

00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:11,860
basic ideas are going to be important it

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:15,789
just before we close i'm going to talk

00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:18,789
about a couple of new things and places

00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:22,090
where people are anticipating new

00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:23,470
technologies i'm going to start it but

00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:25,690
i'm going to ask you to think about

00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,970
things you want to ask about a first

00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:30,010
example I'm going to I'm going to talk

00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:32,740
about is the Economist magazine

00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:35,740
because they were typical of many people

00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,210
who are commenting on the space last

00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,030
year they had an article talking about

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:44,200
blockchain and their anticipation of the

00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:46,990
future was it be like Bitcoin by and the

00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,720
but was they wanted to get rid of mining

00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:53,410
which they saw as wasting electricity

00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:56,610
and they wanted to lock down and have a

00:26:53,410 --> 00:27:00,550
permission to access to the system and

00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:02,320
and that seems reasonable and it seems

00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:05,620
reasonable enough that many people agree

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,210
with them and have similar ideas that

00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,440
are pushing forward and I'm going to

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:12,280
suggest there are a couple of reasons

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,570
why that is not viable for one there

00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,700
have been a hundred people who have

00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:19,300
tried basically that before and have

00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,910
failed and when you take away the mining

00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,440
what you're doing is you're taking away

00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,450
one of the most important pieces of the

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,000
innovation that actually created the

00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:30,670
only currency that started to be to be

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,370
viable so if you roll back those

00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:37,150
innovations rather than standing on the

00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:39,730
shoulders of previous innovators you're

00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:44,290
starting back where where they started

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:46,750
and again we've heard that before and so

00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:48,790
if you kind of look at that those ideas

00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,800
and keep that in mind I think you'll see

00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:53,590
a lot of the ideas that are coming

00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:58,690
forward have that kind of problem just

00:27:53,590 --> 00:28:00,730
inherent in them does anybody heard of

00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:03,490
some other technologies that are

00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:07,710
adjacent or close that they want to talk

00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:07,710
about yes

00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:27,499
and actually I think there's a couple of

00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:30,350
very interesting things about paypal i

00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:33,399
think it's it's a fascinating example it

00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:36,979
started as an attempt to build a

00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:40,700
digital currency that didn't work out

00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:42,320
and they pivoted so that's an important

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,759
thing to remember about paypal and

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,159
that's you know important part of

00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:49,580
starting a business is understanding the

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:54,129
first idea might have work and and they

00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:56,779
were they allowed you to have a trust

00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:59,899
that was less of a leap if you're going

00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:02,779
to a vendor that you weren't is familiar

00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:06,259
with it was easier to make that leap of

00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:09,369
faith with paypal and so i think i think

00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:12,499
that was an important innovation and

00:29:09,369 --> 00:29:14,659
also that credit card transaction that I

00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:20,769
disparaged so much I don't expect it's

00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:20,769
going away super soon so yes

00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:55,610
yes and that's a fantastic a fantastic

00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:58,520
example again on several levels because

00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:01,370
a lot of the distributed computing that

00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:04,150
people are talking about now are there

00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:07,550
finding that the concept of having a big

00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:09,830
database server is not necessarily the

00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:12,770
fastest way to do transactions even just

00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:15,230
on a big database and when they

00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,730
structure it and it takes a lot of time

00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,440
to figure out how to how to get a

00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:22,670
distributed system working but when you

00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:26,179
do you can unleash an amount of power

00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:29,000
that's stupid like it could be really

00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:31,700
fast and then again you're there's a

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,130
project to reward people for coming up

00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:37,400
with a series of prime numbers primecoin

00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:39,110
and so what and that did it rewarded

00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,510
people from using their computing power

00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:43,460
and they were trying to subvert that in

00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:48,140
a way that would solve a puzzle in this

00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:50,900
case finding prime number chains and so

00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:55,700
you'd get a reward when you when you did

00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:58,970
that and so again very innovative it

00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:02,480
picks up on a couple of themes and and

00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:05,270
again the the underlying ideas of

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:09,830
connecting of distributed computing of

00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:11,809
trying to connect many peers has been

00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:13,750
very powerful and I think is a theme

00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:17,510
that we'll we'll see in a lot of

00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:20,870
different ideas that I don't anticipate

00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:28,220
but I know they're out there somebody

00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:31,030
yes established merchants they are not

00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,030
going to just roll over

00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:52,200
okay you have actually like three really

00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:54,360
good things that I realize one of the

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,020
things I've been doing is is going to

00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:00,360
the meetups for a blockchain Cantor

00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:02,429
lately because they're interested in

00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,020
actually finding out what's happening in

00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:06,660
Canada like what what people are

00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,820
actually doing and they they're trying

00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,049
to ask people in finance and different

00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,309
domains whether or not they're

00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:17,570
interested in it and it's kind of funny

00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:22,440
because you might expect this would be a

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:25,020
disruptive technology and and it is and

00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,929
if you know how disruptive technologies

00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:31,700
work you would sort of anticipate that

00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:36,240
the the prime players in the existing

00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:39,960
industry would probably not lead the new

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,790
technology and as much as people at the

00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,880
beginning sort of anticipate that the

00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:48,809
finance guys will know the most they've

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,390
sort of done nothing or not as much the

00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:52,799
people in retail have been finding that

00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,600
people are really interested in maybe

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,580
doing the loyalty programs that would be

00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,110
use that kind of technology or whatever

00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,450
they don't find it threatening and

00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:06,179
they're really interested in using some

00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:09,660
some new ideas so I don't know what will

00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:13,080
come but it seems that people who are in

00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:14,370
the retail industry do find it kind of

00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,350
interesting and they think there's some

00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:18,690
possibilities probably because they

00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:21,179
don't expect to monopolize the financial

00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:25,290
system and they're perfectly willing to

00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:27,360
work in a distributed environment but

00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:29,700
we'll have to see where that goes and

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,679
then the other thing you asked to vote

00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,919
that I remember which may be a subset of

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,600
the things legal and there again

00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:38,340
actually there is quite a bit of

00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,100
interest there's a lot of lawyers who

00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,380
are commenting on the implications I

00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,810
think there's two or three

00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:48,030
that have come out I've read one of them

00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:52,140
not the others so and I'm not a lawyer

00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:55,890
so I I can't give any kind of advice the

00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:58,080
the one book that I read did frame it in

00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:00,780
sort of an interesting way and that is

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,420
that you can come up with a new

00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:07,350
technology but you don't invalidate all

00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:09,960
existing laws and so basically there is

00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:11,850
already a law against theft and if you

00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,370
find some way to steal somebody's

00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:20,129
Bitcoin you should expect that the

00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:23,220
existing law is still valid so you

00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:27,570
shouldn't expect and to some extent um

00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:30,929
it seems a bit like the wild blast but

00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:34,710
in he went through many of the different

00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:40,200
implications and he showed that by and

00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:43,800
large it's not the Wild West the laws do

00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:46,950
apply there are likely to be many

00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:53,520
challenges in applying them in specific

00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:55,050
cases and there always are but it

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,290
doesn't automatically mean that the

00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:59,880
rules rules of disappeared so I'm gonna

00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:02,160
leave it there that's really not

00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,380
satisfying there's there's a lot further

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,670
to go there are actually quite a few

00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:10,230
lawyers who are quite interested in

00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:13,590
space and there again that group those

00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:17,160
people are very interactive and and

00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:19,620
trying to make sure that one of the

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,470
other one of the other reflections on

00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:25,710
that is up or interested in creating

00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:31,650
things like Kickstarter that have a

00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:33,450
distributed basis right and if you use

00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:36,840
that for something that's basically

00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:40,350
charitable then you're probably good but

00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:42,900
the legal implications there the the

00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:45,240
advice that that I heard when they were

00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,590
talking about developing a system I

00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,270
heard some people were talking

00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:54,300
developing a Kickstarter like system

00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:56,430
talk to a lawyer before you before you

00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,220
really establish something partly

00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,859
because what they were going

00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:02,470
do is they're releasing something on the

00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:05,290
etherium blockchain and then anybody can

00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:10,320
use it and you really want to be careful

00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:55,840
how you do that but is it is possible

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:58,240
yes at you first stop yes yes your I

00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:01,930
think your sense on that is totally

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:09,270
correct I I bizarrely oversimplified a

00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:14,910
lot of things so um mining anybody can

00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:19,330
as more people mind more people it'll be

00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:21,190
if the puzzle itself was static it would

00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:23,220
be get easier and easier and people

00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:29,380
would find the blocks faster and faster

00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:31,420
so the the puzzle of you remember how I

00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,210
said in the block you have a random

00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:36,970
number and you just keep incrementing

00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:39,810
that rut number until the hash of the

00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:43,390
block header is below a certain freshman

00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:47,140
every two weeks or so that threshold is

00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:50,530
readjusted so that the average time that

00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:52,540
a block is created is found and and

00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:54,099
finding just means that you come up with

00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:58,480
a random number that satisfies the

00:37:54,099 --> 00:38:00,310
puzzle that's adjusted and so every two

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,560
weeks it's adjusted to keep it about 10

00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:05,349
minutes and so that what that means is

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,780
that as more people put more computing

00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:10,270
power into the network it gets harder

00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:12,790
the puzzles different

00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:14,350
Baldy increases or the number they have

00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:18,250
to threshold blow it you have to mine

00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:20,740
gets harder so if you have one computer

00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:23,500
and you've been mining all along you've

00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:26,020
gotten fewer and fewer rewards and at

00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:30,040
this point if you're mining with a

00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:32,050
computer you're not getting anything the

00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,940
the hash powers has gotten to a point

00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:39,700
where it's it's crazy it's just really

00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:42,640
hard and then the other thing there is

00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:44,920
that I the other thing you suggested and

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,620
I'm not sure if I'm taking it exactly

00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:50,820
the way you intended it but whether it's

00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:56,440
it's fair in terms of how rewards are

00:38:50,820 --> 00:39:04,240
handed out now and historically and I

00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:07,690
one of the funny things too yeah so so

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,700
right now there's actually a discrete

00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,580
number of people who have a huge amount

00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:16,720
of mining power and so the distributed

00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:19,540
nature of the Bitcoin system is actually

00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,220
a little bit questionable it's nobody

00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,150
has half the hashing rate but it's

00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,970
getting to the point where you don't

00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:28,090
have so many people that it's as fair as

00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:31,000
it probably ought to be so that is a

00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:33,700
very real issue one that I think is a

00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,610
legitimate topic for a community

00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:40,420
discussion and a legitimate place where

00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:44,350
I think you need to have a community and

00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:48,780
not be careful about do you mind if I

00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:48,780
let him ask first okay yes

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,460
more likely more than fifty percent

00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,620
would being controlled by something like

00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:15,580
three or four but yeah yeah we were

00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,580
getting much yes

00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,670
you

00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:00,039
yeah I I think that's fair I think

00:40:57,339 --> 00:41:01,359
actually the technology if we just step

00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:04,089
back and look at it a little bit more

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,739
broadly I think the interesting thing

00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:09,009
about the technology is how it sort of

00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:12,579
that the intersection of of technology

00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:14,380
and finance and art really how how

00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:15,849
people interact with with this

00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,739
technology is really important because

00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:20,309
the only thing that will ever give any

00:41:17,739 --> 00:41:23,619
of this technology any value is that

00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:24,700
many people are involved and I think

00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:28,180
you're right there is an equilibrium

00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:32,259
between you know just by it and building

00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:34,559
it the issue of a small number of miners

00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:38,349
having undue influence over the network

00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:41,079
is a little bit of a relevant issue uh

00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:47,279
as long as that's kind of kept in check

00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:47,279
then yeah

00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,520
yes

00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:13,830
sort of really what happens though this

00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:18,510
technology is so nascent so so young

00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:22,500
that it either grows a whole lot or a

00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:24,050
disparities and if you're interested in

00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,700
the case where it grows a whole lot

00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:28,770
confidence is is everything it's the

00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:31,350
only thing that's relevant and so right

00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:33,270
now a discrete number of people

00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:35,369
colluding control the network which

00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:40,020
shoot themselves in the head because

00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:43,320
they give up any opportunity for that

00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:44,640
really high growth well I mean that's

00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,230
not the only opportunity the other

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,320
opportunity for really high growth is

00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:52,680
other innovations coming along somebody

00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,270
creating something else I don't think

00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,980
ethir iam is actually a direct

00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:57,930
competitor but something like that where

00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,260
you're you know you have some new space

00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:04,230
come along and not just people gravitate

00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:09,710
to that if they don't believe that the

00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:09,710
main the main network is is yes

00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:26,099
with your credit card sorry so like I

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:27,780
think a lot of people totally just some

00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:29,940
naive person on the street looking at

00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,040
their options I can pay this way this

00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,660
way this way they cash in my wallet or I

00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:43,020
can wait 10 minutes to find out if my

00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:48,359
transactions did everybody hear that um

00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:51,710
think yes sir okay the question is about

00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:54,440
the 10-minute time between blocks and

00:43:51,710 --> 00:44:00,770
the reason I want everybody here is it's

00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:04,310
interesting one there are layers on that

00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:06,990
first of all if you're a merchant whose

00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:15,359
anticipating accepting small

00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:18,990
transactions then you should have a node

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:21,330
if you have a node you have a list of

00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:23,070
current unspent transaction outputs and

00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:25,200
you can check it right away so you've

00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:27,270
got a good signature you know it's a

00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,589
good signature and you can push it and

00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:34,050
you may feel over two bucks it's not

00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:36,359
worth somebody trying to to cheat you

00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:38,730
because setting up a cheat is non

00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:40,320
trivial exercise the the network is

00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:43,920
established enough so if it's a small

00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:48,480
amount then you're going to frankly take

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:51,180
a risk if it's a transaction of a house

00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,250
there's been a few houses sold I think

00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:55,830
actually larger transactions at this

00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:58,080
point would not really be very viable in

00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:59,400
the future it's completely foreseeable

00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:03,869
but at this point that's kind of the

00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:07,140
upper end I as far as I can tell you're

00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:09,630
not going to go on zero transaction if

00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:12,869
you're selling a house you are going to

00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:15,810
wait for six confirmations and that will

00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:19,890
take an hour now look at your options

00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:22,109
there for a coffee you you complete that

00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:24,960
transaction right away and that's fair

00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:27,180
um and for a house you wait for an hour

00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,260
well your options you're going to take

00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:31,060
that much time anyways so

00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,160
I'm not saying it's the best for every

00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:35,170
transaction I i said earlier that i

00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,210
think the current credit card scheme on

00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:39,700
amazon is it's not going away anytime

00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:42,040
soon like that it's not taking away

00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:44,200
anything immediately but so i'm not

00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:47,440
trying to prove that it's the best for

00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:51,330
actually anything really but i do feel

00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,330
that it's competitive in many domains

00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:10,000
basically yes and there's there's these

00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,920
pros and cons in all of the different

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,720
transaction types so you're always going

00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:18,930
to have that yes okay we've got five

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,930
minutes

00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:43,570
I'm going to I'm going to try to respond

00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,700
to that really quickly so we can get to

00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:52,780
our last question o our last two

00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:54,220
questions okay the first thing is

00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:57,430
litecoin it's an important thing to

00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:58,780
mention since bitcoin was started

00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:02,890
there's probably been seven hundred

00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:05,410
other some some of them more credible

00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:06,640
than others litecoin was one of the the

00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:09,850
really credible ones that a lot of

00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:12,340
people latched onto the thing is that

00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:15,490
the problem was mentioned earlier about

00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:17,200
large-scale mining is one that litecoin

00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:20,260
tried to address by having a different

00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:23,230
algorithm that would be difficult to to

00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:26,280
now the real problem there is that

00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:30,640
people are willing to design equipment

00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:33,280
specially configured for for processing

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,930
these transactions and it's kind of hard

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,870
to get around that and in the case of

00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:39,730
litecoin there is some equipment out

00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:42,190
there that's designed to create like

00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:45,790
calling it it works much faster than

00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:48,610
your PC the effect is much smaller for a

00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:51,610
couple of reasons but it's there to a

00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:53,350
large enough extent that it was a good

00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:57,720
try but it didn't really get around the

00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:57,720
fundamental problem I'm at the back yes

00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:17,190
absolutely when Meg Alex went down

00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:19,590
Bitcoin crashed and and the thing is

00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:22,680
that a lot of people want to kind of get

00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:23,880
in but they don't understand it and and

00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:29,040
so what you should do is you should

00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:31,109
generate a random public key on your own

00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,740
and get your exchange to put money into

00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:37,080
your own people try to find shortcuts

00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:41,450
and they get around it and it doesn't

00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:44,010
was work and Mel Cox did not actually

00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:45,750
undermine the underlying technology the

00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:49,680
under technology technology continues to

00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:52,140
work but that's never being what has

00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,140
really been as important as the social

00:48:52,140 --> 00:49:00,240
thing and it's just complicated enough

00:48:55,140 --> 00:49:02,220
to get that somehow that has to be

00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,859
addressed and I don't think it's fully

00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:06,990
being addressed but the technology

00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:08,940
itself is not particularly weak but

00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:10,800
that's not really the point the point is

00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,750
that has to be socialized and so we've

00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,430
got an open question there and did was

00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:16,430
there a question the top there yes

00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:43,850
I think you're talking to the scaling

00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:45,500
limit limitations in scaling well that's

00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:47,630
confirmation that was his security

00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,940
concern in terms of the time right I'm

00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:52,130
just saying in a big one you want to

00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,630
make sure that your transaction has been

00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:55,580
confirmed several times so it's

00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:58,580
extremely unlikely to get rolled back

00:49:55,580 --> 00:50:01,190
whereas with a coffee if you lose a

00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,570
couple of bucks it's not worth waiting

00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:05,720
around for an hour to make sure the

00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:08,869
confirmations come through but the

00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:12,590
scaling limitations are real they're not

00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:15,980
dissimilar to what we had the counter

00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:17,930
the previous example is actually a email

00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:21,290
when we started adding crazy big

00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:24,200
attachments like pictures because it

00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:26,570
seemed like the email network would have

00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,700
a scaling issue we kind of do have a

00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:31,070
similar issue in terms of scaling in

00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:33,340
terms of you don't really have that many

00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:36,560
transactions going through Bitcoin and

00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:40,880
there are several technologies there's

00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:42,350
an active community the community is a

00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,980
really important consideration and

00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:47,240
that's where I think this group has

00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,350
useful insight so I'm going to leave it

00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,260
at that even though it's a bit of a

00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:53,300
stretch but there's a lot of work like

00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,609
this doesn't really go forward without a

00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,350
great deal of work in terms of

00:50:55,609 --> 00:51:05,710
addressing the issues they're coming up

00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:05,710
so thank you very much thank

00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,180
