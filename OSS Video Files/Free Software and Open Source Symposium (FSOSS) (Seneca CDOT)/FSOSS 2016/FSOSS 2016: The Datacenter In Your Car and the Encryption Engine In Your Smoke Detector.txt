High availability, advanced diagnostics, online backup, deep encryption, and redundant storage used to be features of mission-critical enterprise computing that were not required in little embedded systems. But embedded systems that are quite literally guarding our lives -- and soon, driving us around -- are clearly "mission-critical". How do we ensure that these systems are sufficiently safe, and what role does open source play in our future where computing is pervasive?

I want to talk about a strange

00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:16,290
confluence of of technologies or

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:21,240
technology types that that i'm starting

00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:25,050
to see and this is a little bit a little

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,150
bit unusual I've trying to come up with

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,720
some vocabulary around this I've been

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,699
doing a bit of thinking about what this

00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,970
means and the impact that it's going to

00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:37,110
have on an industry let me start by just

00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,300
turning off the slides there for a

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,950
moment for the most part I'm going to

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,930
speak without slides and just try and

00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:49,379
invoke your imagination on on a few

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,989
things so in terms of trends in

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:56,010
computing there are a couple of things

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:59,879
that that are Buzzard compliance these

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:03,180
days certainly we hear a lot of talk

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:05,280
about the Internet of Things what does

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,200
the Internet of Things mean as with most

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,540
buzz words you can make it mean a lot of

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,820
different things but i think the the

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,880
best definition that I've heard so far

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,890
and unfortunately I didn't didn't record

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,260
where I heard this definition is that

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,439
the Internet of Things is about taking

00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:26,600
physical objects and making them also

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:30,390
digital objects so any any thing that is

00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,820
existing in the real world the Internet

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,009
of Things is about giving that a digital

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,720
connection that can be a sensor

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,869
connection or a control connection

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,670
something like that but the the Internet

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:46,290
of Things is a category of systems that

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:50,130
we have long called embedded systems

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:53,520
that is the concept of a computer system

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:57,299
embedded into something else and there's

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,850
obviously a huge range of systems that

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,850
are embedded and we're certainly going

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,549
towards the low end with the Internet of

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,509
Things so let's just talk about that for

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,250
a moment the first embedded computer

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,470
that I worked with had a single board

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,209
computer in that but at that time single

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,830
board computer was about the same size

00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,180
as sheet of paper roughly eight and half

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,829
I

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,769
so that was that was the embedded

00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:27,310
computer and that system had if I recall

00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:33,310
correctly 48k of memory and 8k of

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:36,980
ultraviolet erased memory wrong chip and

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:39,010
was a fairly fairly inexpensive system

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,909
as a couple hundred bucks at the time

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:47,230
these days the low end of embedded

00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:50,599
systems is more systems like this and

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,519
this is a 96 boards device a smaller

00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,739
form factor than what grant mentioned

00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,260
this morning this is the the new IOT

00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:59,810
form factor for 96 boards and as a

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,849
development board this is obviously much

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,439
bigger than the device needs to be

00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,569
there's a bunch of connectors on here

00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:10,370
whose sole purpose is to make it easier

00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:12,590
to program and debug and test using this

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,379
device but on there we've got a

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,200
microcontroller in this particular case

00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:22,129
the microcontroller is an arm cortex m4

00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,989
and you can go down scale from that you

00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:27,290
can go a little bit farther down to an

00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:33,109
m0 or an M 0 plus which is a fact a

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:36,169
fairly really tiny micro controller but

00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:38,030
probably comparable or faster than that

00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:41,030
eight and a half by 11 board that i use

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,530
all those years ago you're not saying

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:46,009
thing about in amazon it's usually

00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:50,269
implemented with a current or slightly

00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:53,180
older technology a 45 or 55 nanometer

00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:57,109
chip construction process but if you

00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:00,669
took the m0 or MZ r 0 plus design and

00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:02,810
you implemented it in a cutting-edge

00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:05,569
process technology it made a

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,729
cutting-edge chip out of it with a 10

00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:10,489
nanometer or 14 nanometer process if

00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:14,720
I've done the math right you could fit

00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:16,970
two or three of those processors stacked

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,329
side by side on the edge of a piece of

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:24,139
paper on the edge let's think about that

00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:29,210
you've got a spec that is like a third

00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:30,480
of a piece of a paper in in dimension

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,730
square

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,990
that's not even big enough to connect

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:39,240
any wires to let alone you know have it

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:42,030
something that you that you can touch or

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,070
or mount or or do something like that so

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,170
obviously that that processor by itself

00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,460
isn't going to be implemented like that

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,020
it's going to have some memory some

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,710
peripherals put around it it's going to

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:55,080
have a several thousand times larger set

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,210
of connection pads added to it so that

00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,130
you can actually attach some wires to it

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,360
get some signals in and out of it but

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:06,060
imagine how much power that speck is

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,910
going to need to operate it's going to

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:12,540
run on a really really manute amount of

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:15,330
power and in fact the that class of

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,790
processor can run off of ambient energy

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:21,000
you can take just the normal vibration

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,980
of people walking past in a hallway or a

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,740
car going down the road where you can

00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,720
take heat that's escaping from a vehicle

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,160
or a building and it can pass through a

00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,040
device that collects a bit of

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,710
electricity from that just ambient

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,330
energy and stores it up and then allows

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,870
that processor to do things on a

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,880
periodic basis take sensor readings and

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,470
then report that the real challenge is

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,480
actually how you're going to report that

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,770
out of there the radio or the network

00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,660
connection that's going to report that

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,150
information is the thing that's going to

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,720
draw the power the the processor itself

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,600
is is almost an insignificant amount of

00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,030
power if you want to think about

00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,190
applications of that type of technology

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:05,850
think about the sensor that you have

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:08,370
inside the tire of your car there's a

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,680
sensor in each for each of the four

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,360
wheels of your car that most cars

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,090
there's an alternate way of doing this

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,950
but typically a modern vehicle will have

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:21,150
a sensor in there and it's a tiny little

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:23,570
package attached to the valve stem that

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:27,720
package contains a microprocessor an

00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:31,890
accelerometer a air pressure sensor and

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:34,740
a small radio circuit the power source

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:37,560
for that is one of these lithium coin

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,980
cells so you've got something about the

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,689
size of a quarter and it's expected to

00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,919
have a 10-year life

00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:50,639
this coin cell powers that computer for

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:55,439
a decade obviously really really tiny

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:59,909
power consumption there what's the

00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,439
accelerometer doing inside your wheel

00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:03,919
why do you have an accelerometer in your

00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:07,259
side your tire if you think about it

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,360
almost all of us have our cars parked

00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:12,409
more than they're driven even if you are

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,549
an avid driver such as heaven Weaver

00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:17,610
you're going to drive less than 12 hours

00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:18,719
a day on average and most of the time

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,519
that card is going to be sitting there

00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:22,469
not going anywhere you probably don't

00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,779
care about your tire pressure when

00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:27,089
you're not driving and so part of the

00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:30,929
approach to getting that battery to last

00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:33,149
a decade is to simply sleep when

00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:35,789
nothing's going on when the wheel is not

00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:38,669
moving you don't care when the wheel is

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:40,949
moving then the processor takes that

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:43,049
into account and it starts saying okay I

00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:46,319
need to report I don't need to report

00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:48,719
the pressure continuously I can report

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,439
it every 10 15 30 minutes and that's

00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:54,629
enough for the car but the radio inside

00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:57,929
your tire needs to communicate with the

00:07:54,629 --> 00:08:00,749
frame of the car and if it's at the

00:07:57,929 --> 00:08:02,399
bottom of its rotation it's quite a

00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:04,949
distance from the little antenna that's

00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,360
mounted in the frame of your car so it's

00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:07,979
going to need a fair bit of energy to

00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,860
broadcast a signal that can be received

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:13,559
so the the device actually uses the

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,989
accelerometer to figure out based on the

00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:18,419
acceleration of gravity where it is and

00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:21,389
it does the broadcast at the top of the

00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:23,959
turn so that it can use a lower powered

00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:28,259
signal to communicate with the vehicle

00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:30,329
so this is an example of the the low end

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:34,110
where we're going with with sensors that

00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:36,930
just sip power that use very very tiny

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,269
amounts of power there's all sorts of

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:42,180
interesting aspects to that what happens

00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:44,579
when you have tiny sensors that sip

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,829
power and generate a tiny quantity of

00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:50,509
data but you deploy those in the

00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:53,069
millions then you have a flood of data

00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:55,360
tiny trickles all come together like a

00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:57,040
river that is a

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,720
torrent when you've compiled all of

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,380
those together so there's some really

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,519
interesting challenges in the iot space

00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,800
but that's not really where I want to

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,670
focus I want to take a look at another

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:12,640
type of embedded system this is a bedded

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:14,470
system that is a little bit upscale from

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,940
that and if you can picture embedded

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,120
systems will go all the way from those

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,089
tiny little sensors running on miniscule

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,730
amounts of energy to fairly large and

00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:27,060
complex systems consider the embedded

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,100
computer built into an industrial robot

00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,230
so a system like that may be doing some

00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,700
pretty complicated work it will have a

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,399
lot of different sensors pressure

00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,959
sensors positional sensors perhaps even

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,910
machine vision systems and that device

00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:45,550
or that control system needs to collect

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:49,240
a lot of input do a lot of analysis and

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:52,440
it's it's a much larger system than the

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,000
tiny one at the at the other end and yet

00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,920
both of these systems with a little bit

00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,019
of exception on the high end both of

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:05,170
those systems operate largely in the

00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:07,899
same way year after year with little

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,519
change right your tire sensor is not

00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,890
something that you need to update the

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,350
software on the way that we collect

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:16,180
entire data pressure tire pressure data

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,820
a few years ago is the same way that

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,260
we're going to do it five years from now

00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:23,529
that's that's a fixed fixed function

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,420
device to some extent maybe to a

00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:27,670
slightly lesser extent the industrial

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,949
robot will be the same thing you'll have

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,370
it working on putting chairs together

00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:35,290
and it will just happily do that until

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,540
you have an industrial designer that

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,250
modifies your chair slightly but

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,329
basically it's it's sitting there doing

00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:46,240
the the same task all the way through

00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:49,140
okay so embedded systems there's a wide

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,850
range of devices and we seem to be

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:55,449
expanding down into the the tinier end

00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:56,740
of that range on an ongoing basis let's

00:10:55,449 --> 00:11:00,250
put that aside for a moment and let's

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,990
look over at enterprise systems so

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,290
enterprise system from a software point

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:08,200
of view is a system that is that

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:13,180
provides the core functionality to run

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:15,130
your company or your educational

00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,140
institution or your government or

00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,210
whatever your particular Enterprise is

00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,710
but from a hardware point of view an

00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,760
enterprise system has certain

00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:28,150
characteristics we expect that an

00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,340
enterprise system these days be well

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:33,550
connected that you can access the data

00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:36,520
from any of the geographic locations of

00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,680
your particular Enterprise we expect it

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,900
to be there all the time you don't

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,360
expect to walk up to the to the desk in

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,340
a hotel and they say oh we don't really

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,230
know whether you've reserved or not you

00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,300
expect to be able to present your name

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,880
and they'll have all the details of your

00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,620
reservation at the fingertips and so

00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,780
there are some qualities of the system

00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:01,240
that that go with that and let me just

00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,860
propose a few of them here these are the

00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,870
kinds of things that I would expect to

00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:09,280
see in a real enterprise class system

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,350
pretty pretty significant levels of

00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:15,700
compute you don't expect to be waiting

00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:17,800
around a long time for reports or data

00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,950
retrieval or those types of things you

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,470
expect that such a system will have good

00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,240
compute performance air tolerant memory

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,840
so if something is wrong in the memory

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,160
subsystem you don't get renamed your

00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,770
reservation doesn't get move to a

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,420
different continent that there's

00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:39,010
automatic recovery from those sorts of

00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:41,470
things you expect things like redundant

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,750
power and cooling that you know if you

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,610
buy an enterprise system it's got two

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,400
power supplies in it it's got multiple

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,890
fans it's as much as possible been

00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,950
engineered to avoid single points of

00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,950
failure

00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,470
you expect high volumes of input-output

00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,089
much higher than you'd have on your

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,329
personal computer I'm personal computer

00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:06,040
has maybe at most a 1 gigabit connection

00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:08,050
but enterprise class systems you would

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,449
expect to have high capacity connections

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,860
they would be the type of system that

00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:14,139
would be accessed by thousands of web

00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,660
users or thousands of internal users and

00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:18,370
so you've got an entirely different

00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:22,079
level of network connectivity and

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,079
probably some redundancy there as well

00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:30,160
predictive failure analysis the the

00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:31,660
better enterprise systems have analysis

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,790
when something is wrong if there's a

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,209
problem with a memory chip then an

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,980
analysis system kicks in and says hmm

00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:40,839
that's the third memory error that we've

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:44,379
had at that particular location or in

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:47,230
that particular page we'd better mark

00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:49,629
that page as suspect or mark that

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,610
particular trip as suspect will right

00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:53,829
around it will use different different

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,019
pieces of memory because we expect that

00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:57,939
that may fail the same with a disk if a

00:13:56,019 --> 00:14:00,069
disk has thrown a couple of errors a

00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:03,699
predictive failure analysis system will

00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:05,980
usually kick in and say that disk yeah

00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:08,290
is below threshold I don't think we can

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,209
trust it let's start using a hot spare

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,519
and we'll rebuild our storage so that we

00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:15,850
don't need to use that potentially

00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:18,519
failing part an enterprise system will

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:22,990
often have accelerators so for

00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:24,999
cryptography or for particular math

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,639
operations or encode and decode

00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:30,189
operations for streaming video or what

00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:33,730
have you there may be dedicated hardware

00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:36,069
to to produce to do those particular

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:39,910
things optimizing it for a particular

00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:43,420
workload will see we're done at storage

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:46,569
arrays we until recently has stored

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:50,980
stuff on magnetic disks which sounds

00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:54,040
great unless you rename them as spinning

00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:56,559
rust because iron oxide is rust you're

00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,769
spinning a piece of rust at whatever it

00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:02,709
is 7200 rpm or 10,000 RPM and you're

00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:04,629
entrusting your critical data to to this

00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:06,699
spinning rust it's a mechanical device

00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:07,139
the only thing that you know about a

00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:08,309
hard

00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:12,929
five is that it is guaranteed to

00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:15,119
eventually lose your data so we make

00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:16,920
that somewhat less likely by storing our

00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:20,519
data on multiple pieces of spinning rust

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:33,329
or these days multiple pieces of flash

00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:35,999
memory what else do we have in there yes

00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:38,970
yes and so we've got we've got issues

00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:41,189
with with flash as well typically you

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,699
would have some hot standby processors

00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:45,989
so you would have in a more complex

00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:48,480
configurations you would have a standby

00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:50,519
machine ready to assume responsibility

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,730
for a machine that fails so a machine

00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:56,040
overheats or gets hit by lightning or

00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,679
what have you another machine is on

00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,660
standby it should kick in and you should

00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:05,519
have a migration of functionality to

00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:07,949
that device and for a mission-critical

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,559
environment one in which you're betting

00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:12,689
your million-dollar multi-million dollar

00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:16,079
billion dollar multi-billion dollar

00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:17,819
company you want to ensure that the

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,419
software on that is controlled so you

00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:23,160
usually have very rigorous mechanisms in

00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:27,419
place to ensure that software updates

00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:29,489
are secure and so forth so this is not

00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,169
an exhaustive list but this is I think a

00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:33,269
list of some of the typical features

00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:38,009
that you would see in an enterprise

00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:41,069
computing platform now this sounds like

00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:44,419
overkill for an embedded system doing

00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:48,540
this for your attire pressure sensor

00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:51,019
doesn't make a lot of sense however

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,939
we're starting to see embedded systems

00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:57,660
go into some very very interesting

00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:59,970
environments which of these features we

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,509
do not want in your autonomous cars

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:05,970
computer system in a context like that

00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:08,760
where lives are on the line especially

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,559
yours if you are inside that vehicle it

00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,199
makes sense to take some of these

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:16,260
concepts from an enterprise context and

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,310
use them in what is effectively an

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,020
embedded device

00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,490
that that's not a general-purpose

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,350
computer that's a computer that's

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,570
designed very specifically for a

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:27,330
particular task a particular workload

00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:30,330
and you want a lot of those same high

00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:34,230
availability high performance features

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:38,120
in that particular context there are a

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:41,730
range of other embedded systems that

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:46,010
have features that are not typical

00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:49,380
traditional embedded system features and

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:52,830
an example of that would be for example

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:56,540
a an industrial device so we've been

00:17:52,830 --> 00:18:00,990
doing some work within a industrial unit

00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:03,960
the predecessor model had a two-line LCD

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,460
display and some push buttons so you

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:10,260
could change a couple of settings on it

00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:13,080
it had no network capacity it had no

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,590
software updating capacity it has no

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,680
ability to save data to removable media

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:22,200
it had no local analytics none of those

00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,690
sorts of features we're working with

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:29,190
that company to update that system so

00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:33,360
that it has a 64-bit quad-core arm

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:35,300
computer in it and that 64-bit computer

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,430
presents a color touchscreen interface

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:41,820
it has a network connection for remote

00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:45,390
support and for remote data dumping it

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:49,770
has removal media options as far as USB

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:53,010
and it will in due course have some

00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:57,750
advanced options for local analytics and

00:18:53,010 --> 00:19:00,120
for some on device machine learning so

00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:03,330
there's a whole different level of

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:06,600
compute that is being applied to an

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:09,300
embedded context here that's not as

00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,750
critical of context as you would have

00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:15,210
for let's say an autonomous vehicle but

00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,220
it is still a context that has a number

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,290
of features that even just a few years

00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,630
ago we would have seen more in the

00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:25,650
enterprise system than in an embedded

00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:29,580
system so what's what's the significance

00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,320
here what does this mean i think that

00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,009
there's

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,080
several significant impacts of having

00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:43,539
this technology move down into the

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:45,710
embedded space one of those is that the

00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:49,130
infrastructure that we've built around

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,419
the technology and that i'm not talking

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,149
there about technology infrastructure

00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:56,539
i'm talking about standards and process

00:19:53,149 --> 00:20:00,620
infrastructure a lot of that doesn't

00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:02,840
exist in the embedded space so there is

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,480
no standard way to boot an embedded

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,190
system while there's no broadly adopted

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,179
standard way to a boot and embedded

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:13,700
system we have that in with industry

00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:15,409
standard enterprise systems right

00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,330
there's well to find ways that that

00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:22,970
system should start up how the software

00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:25,340
should load and and so forth we need to

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:27,289
take some of the the thinking around

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:30,470
that we need to take some of the

00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:33,440
thinking of of support for a

00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:37,039
standardized platform and take that into

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,200
this sort of super embedded space we

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,750
need to take security a lot more

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,759
seriously it's true that you will never

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,580
update the software on your tire

00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,049
pressure monitor but in part that's

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,139
because the communication with that

00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:52,700
device is outbound only it gives you

00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:55,039
information but it doesn't really

00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,159
receive information and there is really

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,990
no chance that a hacker is going to

00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:04,100
target your device and break in and

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:05,659
override your your pressure settings but

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,649
that's that's sort of a minimal case

00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:13,190
there are many other devices where we

00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:15,470
are adding a lot more intelligence and

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:20,389
those devices are becoming potential

00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:25,090
targets for attack so consider consider

00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:31,539
the damage that is possible from attack

00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:34,909
think about this a thermostat in a house

00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:36,350
for decades was a little

00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:40,280
electromechanical device and you

00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:43,400
probably grew up or your neighbor had

00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,200
one of those round things that you just

00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,010
turn to set a particular temperature and

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,740
there was a bimetallic spiral spring

00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:54,590
inside it and little mercury capsule is

00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:57,590
so much for reduced hazardous materials

00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:02,000
as a little mercury capsule inside glass

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:05,570
is in there and as it heated up the the

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,430
little coil moved and and if the

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:10,610
combination of the amount of movement of

00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:14,360
that coil and the position that you sat

00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:16,100
on the dial happens to pass a threshold

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,320
the mercury flowed to one end of the

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:23,180
tube it shorted some stuff at you and

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:25,430
your furnace game on more recently we've

00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:28,810
put embedded a very simple embedded

00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:32,720
system in to thermostat so through the

00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:34,910
90s and the 2000s you had thermostats

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,070
where you could set a schedule you could

00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:40,040
set up when you're going to be home when

00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:46,790
you're going to be a way some super

00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:49,310
basic microcontroller in there just kept

00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:51,650
track of what the current temperature

00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:54,950
should be compared it to reading it was

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:57,620
getting from a 30-cent thermal sensor

00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,540
and again made the decision well based

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,760
on that temperature and the the setting

00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,380
that was supplied by the user the

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,710
furnace or the air conditioner should be

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,910
turned on or not turned on those were a

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,770
bit more expensive where the

00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,740
electromechanical device might have been

00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:15,050
worth twenty bucks the the fancier one

00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,850
that you buy in the 90s or the 2000s

00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:20,810
would be maybe a forty dollar device or

00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:22,700
a $35 device but these days we walk into

00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:25,130
a home depot and you go looking for a

00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,620
thermostat what do you see I've got this

00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:30,140
nice display of devices from nest right

00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:33,140
and they're on their third generation

00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,480
now but all of them intelligent devices

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,280
that interface into your network and

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,410
attached to some cloud services and

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,990
actually provide some useful services

00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,630
you don't have to teach them when you're

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:47,840
what your schedule is they'll learn it

00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:50,060
they'll have presence technology they'll

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,140
interface with your apps and and some

00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:53,570
other things they'll learn when you're

00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,870
home they learn from when you turn up

00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,050
and

00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,940
the thermostat what you like and they'll

00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:00,260
do that but they'll also communicate

00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,640
with you they'll notify you if

00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,590
something's wrong your furnace isn't

00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,850
working and you've got features like

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:09,440
that what what the product manufacturer

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,320
likes about that is that they've turned

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,630
what was a twenty-dollar device into

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,030
four model one of that a two hundred

00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:20,650
fifty dollar device or for the new model

00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:22,790
3 330 dollar device so we've got a

00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,920
significant increase in functionality

00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:26,870
but we've also moved to a situation

00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:30,130
where we've had a significant increase

00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:32,960
in price let's think about that even the

00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:36,290
embedded processor version of that

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,950
thermostat was not something that you

00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:42,710
could really that you had to worry about

00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:46,160
external attacks on but an

00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:49,340
internet-connected cloud-based singing

00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,260
and dancing thermostat is potentially

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,270
something that somebody could externally

00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,970
hack into if you can set the temperature

00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:58,880
with an app on your phone then there's

00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,620
no reason that somebody couldn't attack

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,340
that device figure out how to set that

00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:06,650
and have that control now what's the

00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:08,059
worst that could happen they could turn

00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:11,200
your house into a bit of a sauna I

00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:14,030
suppose and that would be uncomfortable

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,250
perhaps more dangerously if you weren't

00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,690
home they could freeze at your house

00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,120
right they could set the temperature low

00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:22,340
or turn the furnace off and you could

00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,610
have burst pipes and and that type of

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:29,320
thing but there's certainly a security

00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:33,140
element to this this significant

00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:36,380
increase in the capability of embedded

00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:39,679
systems so a couple of things here

00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:41,750
there's the the need for security

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,730
especially as far as software updating

00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,730
and remote access there is

00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:56,630
where was I a second to go with that so

00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:00,320
we got the the need for the for the

00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:02,690
enhanced security but we have other

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,220
features that that we've used in the

00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,860
enterprise space that may be useful even

00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,970
in a thermostat because of the

00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,900
importance at least in in our climate of

00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,550
protecting your house with your

00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,160
thermostat so that you don't burst pipes

00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,870
and cause fifty thousand dollars worth

00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,510
of damage due to flooding throughout

00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,010
your throughout your house that's

00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:25,040
actually a fairly mission-critical

00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:29,300
device so how do we how do we address

00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:31,880
that how do we make that device really a

00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:36,370
high-availability device right we talk

00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:40,300
about the difficult to attain five nines

00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:44,780
99.999% uptime for enterprise systems

00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:48,590
but what does that mean for the the

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:50,480
embedded systems the connected smart

00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:53,540
embedded systems that we're starting to

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,460
surround ourselves with you know we

00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,920
would probably expect better than five

00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,380
nines reliability out of the old

00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,260
mechanical thermostat we should probably

00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,060
expect something similar from the from

00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,980
the new electronic system but it's

00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,580
difficult to attain that level of

00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:13,600
reliability without a fairly high cost

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:17,030
so so how do we do that how do we take

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,920
the the technology pieces that have

00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:20,420
given us some of these features in the

00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:25,160
enterprise space and how do we bring

00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:26,570
that into into embedded systems at the

00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,730
same time not completely blowing the

00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:30,200
budget $10,000 probably a little high

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:36,890
for a thermostat that's sitting on your

00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:40,130
wall I think it's important in this to

00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:45,080
consider I think it's important in this

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:48,860
to consider the the the value of what

00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:52,640
can go wrong so the worst thing that can

00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:55,640
happen I would expect with a thermostat

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,970
that was hacked I can see probably too

00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,610
bad scenarios one is that your house is

00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,010
frozen your pipes burst tens of

00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:05,530
thousands dollars damage that

00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:08,740
there's also the possibility that the

00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:11,050
presence detection system in that could

00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,330
be used to leak information to somebody

00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:15,190
that wanted to let's say physically and

00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:17,290
go and steal stuff from your house right

00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:21,240
the fact that your home were not home is

00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:24,070
actually valuable data to some people so

00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:27,100
there's there's a couple of pieces there

00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:31,420
but but really if you do a sort of risk

00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:37,600
evaluation it's not huge take a look at

00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:41,050
the autonomous vehicle situation what

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:48,280
can go wrong with an autonomous vehicle

00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:50,680
system that fails what should happen

00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,180
what should happen what is a shutdown

00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,370
what does a blue screen of death would

00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,440
look like for an autonomous vehicle

00:28:54,370 --> 00:29:00,450
during 100 kilometers now or down the

00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:03,190
401 you would hope that it would involve

00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:05,890
graceful shutdown right you would want a

00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,990
situation where it would fail safe so

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:12,100
when it fails it fails on the safe side

00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:13,960
which would probably be to whatever pull

00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:18,010
over and coast to a stop and turn the

00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:20,200
4-ways on or something like that but if

00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,170
you think about what a safe failure

00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:28,200
looks like it varies enormously

00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:31,630
depending on the context so for a drone

00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,400
let's say maybe a heavy drone that's

00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:38,350
carrying a high-definition camera for a

00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:41,110
movie shoot stopping is not a good fail

00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:43,570
state for a drone just turn everything

00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:45,280
off that is not a good fail state for

00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:48,430
that it's going to drop out of the sky

00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,800
smash somebody on the head and probably

00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:53,550
kill them or land them in hospital so

00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:57,190
there's there's some thought needed here

00:29:53,550 --> 00:30:00,160
what is the risk how much do we need to

00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:03,480
spend to get the level of reliability

00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:06,660
that we want how many of these features

00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:10,480
do we need to bring into that particular

00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:13,120
super embedded context to provide the

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,520
reliability to provide the safety to

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,110
provide the performance guarantees that

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,500
we really need

00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:25,120
and what does it look like how do we

00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:26,860
picture the worst cases how do we plan

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,220
for that how do we make sure that a

00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:32,559
worse case results in a safe failure

00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,970
this is something that we can learn an

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,970
area where we can learn from the nuclear

00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:39,809
industry they have for years as part of

00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:43,299
the design principle of nuclear reactors

00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:45,520
had this concept of failsafe if it's

00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:49,090
going to fail and there's two ways to

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,280
fail the safe side and the catastrophic

00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:54,250
side you want to have sort of the

00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:57,880
default position to be failing on the

00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:59,710
safe side right and again as I say the

00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,380
definition of what safe varies

00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:05,679
enormously it could mean stop maybe stop

00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:07,690
is not safe in in other contexts so

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,780
there's there's a bunch of pieces here

00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:15,190
that we need to bring together in a lot

00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:18,160
of cases what we need to examine is the

00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:21,480
cost of bringing the features that we

00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:26,710
need for a particular level of

00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:30,640
reliability and safety to a particular

00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:33,910
device this is necessitated by as I've

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,410
said the advancement in capacity and

00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:38,110
advancement in the ability of these

00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:41,429
embedded systems plus the connectivity

00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:44,370
of those devices we we know how to do

00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:47,500
five nines right we know how to do

00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:51,580
99.999% reliability or better we've been

00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:54,580
doing it in this space for a while it's

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:56,590
expensive it's difficult it consumes a

00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,900
lot of power so we have to carefully

00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:01,840
look at that and say how can we take

00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:04,870
selectively particular features from

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:08,500
that use it in the super embedded space

00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:10,750
and reach our target as far as the

00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:13,840
performance reliability availability and

00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:16,720
so forth of those systems I think this

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,120
is an area that is going to receive a

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,700
lot of attention going forward one

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,169
aspect of that of this particularly the

00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,120
security aspect is getting a lot of

00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:27,850
attention especially after the attacks

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,470
the other day on the internet in the

00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:32,350
United States

00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:35,140
and our realization that the very low

00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:37,570
end of the embedded space is the wild

00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:41,950
wild west right we've got unprotected

00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:44,740
systems that go unpatched from unknown

00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:46,750
sources and there's a lot of danger

00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,630
there I think what we need to start

00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:51,429
looking at as we install these super

00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:56,100
embedded systems that very intelligent

00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:59,409
and its many cases life critical systems

00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:02,320
we need to look there at the whole range

00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:06,850
of security and performance and

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:09,760
reliability issues that arise and I

00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:12,039
think for those of you who are students

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,570
are considering a new direction I think

00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:19,059
actually that there's a lot of potential

00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:26,280
and a lot of interesting opportunities

00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:26,280
that exist in this space all right

00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:33,610
so that was the that was the gist of my

00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:37,870
message and I'm sure there are a lot of

00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:41,440
different angles to this so I'd like to

00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:43,300
open it up for discussion will take some

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,910
some questions and maybe will provoke a

00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:51,070
bit of discussion about this yes Scott

00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:54,040
one of the things that I didn't see this

00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:57,490
talk was where you feel about the

00:33:54,040 --> 00:34:02,290
amplification of that biggity devices

00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:04,570
never angle lies what I'm getting at is

00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:07,810
here at stake example your nest

00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:11,230
thermostat a modest installation of five

00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:16,510
percent of the population would be about

00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:18,760
1.8 billion Canadians that's a thousand

00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:21,179
dollars property damage for individual

00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:25,590
which you compromise the whole system

00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:25,590
that's a few billion dollars of property

00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:31,990
you I agree I think your numbers are a

00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:37,380
bit high because you're counting

00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:46,780
population not buildings but right so so

00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:49,270
the application so the question just to

00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,820
to repeat it for the audience the

00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:54,370
question is how does am placate

00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:57,460
amplification effect they the fact that

00:34:54,370 --> 00:35:00,940
you have large quantities of similar

00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:03,850
systems being installed impact this and

00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:08,260
in particular in terms of risk analysis

00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:10,000
what is the impact of having hundreds of

00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,010
thousands perhaps millions of devices

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,190
that are installed that have similar

00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,390
characteristics and I would expect that

00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,220
you're asking that question from

00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:20,740
particularly the security point of view

00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:24,480
unless so from the reliability and

00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:27,130
availability angles run around in change

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,420
thermostats is impractical right

00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:30,420
changing one

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,580
that digital thermostats has already

00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:42,650
been proven trivial right so let's let's

00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:47,240
consider that for for a moment wherever

00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:50,360
you have a common organized organism

00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,430
existing in nature disease can rip

00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,890
through that population quite easily

00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:57,020
right you've got a monoculture you've

00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:59,120
got a population with the same

00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,860
vulnerabilities and they're susceptible

00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,900
to the same sorts of things that an

00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,280
infection will rip through we can see

00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,710
the same thing with digital attacks

00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,350
right if you've got large quantities of

00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:11,090
systems with the same properties

00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:13,280
susceptible to the same problems then

00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,530
obviously an attack against one of them

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,930
can be an attack against any of them and

00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:20,180
the the network effect becomes very

00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:23,450
significant there I think one thing that

00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:27,830
you will have almost zero disagreement

00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:31,280
about within the technical community is

00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:34,340
that it's essential that any network

00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,690
connected device be upgradable it's

00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:39,140
almost guaranteed that there will be

00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:41,600
bugs in that software the real question

00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,430
is how serious are those bugs and when

00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:49,700
will they be exploited not whether they

00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:51,050
will be exploited it's also generally

00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:55,310
accepted that there's not a lot of

00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:59,360
incentive for either the producers of

00:36:55,310 --> 00:37:01,910
those devices nor the consumers of those

00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:07,100
devices to keep the software up to date

00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:09,410
a company that well in the case of the

00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:12,830
recent internet attacks right a one

00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:14,900
company produce a range of network

00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:17,180
connected cameras and digital video

00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,430
recorders they sold these two other

00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,650
companies that branded them and package

00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:26,060
them in their own fancy casings and and

00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:28,820
sold them on now no one in that

00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:30,350
ecosystem really cared about software

00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:32,240
upgrade ability right they've just

00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:34,520
wanted to pump the devices I would get

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,300
them installed get the money from it and

00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:41,210
that was that was it likewise the users

00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:43,480
of those cameras the small business that

00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:46,390
has five or ten or

00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,430
20 of those network connected cameras if

00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,109
you approach them and say you're going

00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:52,240
to have to rip all of your camera's out

00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:55,210
and replace them with new ones so that

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:59,560
Twitter can stay up they're going to say

00:37:55,210 --> 00:38:01,690
what no I'm not replacing my camera's

00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,820
not spending a couple thousand dollars

00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:06,790
to replace the cameras to keep Twitter

00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:09,760
alive that's that just doesn't matter to

00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:12,280
me so they're neat there could be some

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,859
actors in between that come into play

00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:21,580
you could have for example ISPs cut off

00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:24,880
service to customers that operated in

00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:27,460
secure devices that's pretty hard line

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:31,300
and that's maybe not really attractive

00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:35,830
to the to the ISPs themselves to play

00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:37,570
the role of cop but there also seems to

00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:39,550
be a fair bit of agreement in the

00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:43,180
industry that one of the significant

00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:46,030
ways forward there is to stop inventing

00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:48,700
our own unique solution to every little

00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:51,070
connected device right to use common

00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:53,020
platforms this is where we see projects

00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:56,020
such as Zephyr having a significant

00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:57,490
value common open source platform that

00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,680
can be used across a wide range of

00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:01,359
devices with you know a little bit of

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,210
secret sauce on top for the particular

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:08,470
device that is being installed with

00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:11,740
standardized secure updating mechanisms

00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:14,170
so that it becomes much less expensive

00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,570
for the vendor to offer those security

00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:19,810
updates and it actually becomes much

00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:21,280
less of a hassle for the consumer to you

00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,940
accept those updates to have them

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,320
downloaded over their network it's done

00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,290
automatically with a small amount of

00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:32,590
data and without significant cost to the

00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:35,230
to the consumer so one of I think one of

00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:37,810
the important piece is going forward in

00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:40,890
security from the Internet of Things

00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:44,590
range up to sort of the the mid-high

00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:46,930
super embedded range is is going to be

00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:49,630
standardization right now we've got the

00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:53,109
wild wild west right how many of you

00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:54,950
have a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth enabled light

00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:57,440
bulb in your house

00:39:54,950 --> 00:40:00,950
okay this is a little bit of a fringe

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,470
case right those light bulbs probably

00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:08,410
have their own unique app and their own

00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:11,000
unique protocol right every other little

00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:13,579
residential IOT devices probably also

00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,520
got its own silly little app and its own

00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:20,390
gateway protocol and so forth and so

00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:22,940
it's wild wild west were too early to

00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:24,710
really expect standardization we've had

00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:28,250
a bit of innovation and we've got some

00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:31,940
for movement but please let's not wait

00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:34,310
longer before we converge on a small set

00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:36,140
of platforms on some gateway standards

00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:38,930
some communication standards and some

00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:44,380
best practices for the management of

00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:44,380
security there yes

00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:08,930
haha excellent question so the the point

00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:12,619
is on the desktop we standardize on crap

00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:14,089
and yes we did absolutely I don't think

00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:17,690
you just find a whole lot of people that

00:41:14,089 --> 00:41:19,400
would argue with that however in the

00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:20,900
enterprise space we've tried to

00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,410
standardize on something a little better

00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:29,180
than complete crap with mixed success

00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:34,579
right so I think I think what we need to

00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:37,990
do is as an industry first collaborate

00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:40,250
if we independently try to come up with

00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:42,290
mechanisms to do what we want to do and

00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:44,180
again this is we're largely focusing on

00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:47,480
security here if we and try to

00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:50,299
independently implement a secure

00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:53,180
updating mechanism we're wasting a ton

00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:56,960
of effort most of us are probably going

00:41:53,180 --> 00:42:00,380
to do it wrong and and we'll end up with

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,480
a very expensive hodgepodge and so as I

00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,220
mentioned the Zephyr project there's

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,650
others such as embed and so forth that

00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:09,920
are moving towards standardized

00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:13,790
platforms and if you are an embedded

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,290
product producer a developer we're

00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:18,349
getting to the point where it really

00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:20,450
doesn't make any sense and in fact I'm

00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:24,530
thinking we're probably stole a year or

00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:26,390
two out before it becomes absolutely a

00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:29,140
no-brainer decision to use a

00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:32,089
standardized platform just because

00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:33,920
reinventing the wheel is is going to be

00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:36,260
too expensive that's really where we are

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,210
with the Linux kernel right you you're

00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:40,000
going to are you going to write your own

00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:42,770
kernel for for a particular application

00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,869
it makes no sense right take the

00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:46,609
billions of dollars of work that have

00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:49,190
already been done on the linux kernel

00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:52,369
add something to it and you can use that

00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:55,280
as a platform for an advanced

00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:57,799
intelligent system scaling down from

00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,049
that what more towards the tiny IOT

00:42:57,799 --> 00:43:01,700
device end of the scale we need a

00:43:00,049 --> 00:43:08,430
similar solution it's got to be open

00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:10,230
source industry standard but smaller

00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:11,880
it's got to be a platform that can run a

00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,560
system smaller than what you would want

00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,620
to run linux on smaller than what you

00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:23,870
would want to run a bsd or some of these

00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:23,870
other standard larger platforms on yeah

00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:32,680
like the bottom line because I was

00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:35,560
trying to go prepare your idea either

00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,860
bottom line coming to be provided

00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:41,380
incentives

00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:45,460
we've got another ruler collaborative

00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:48,170
course he share any

00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:51,020
it's a very good a very good question

00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:52,550
how do we teach but but let me turn that

00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:57,109
around and say in a general sense how do

00:43:52,550 --> 00:44:00,619
we how do we teach corporations to be

00:43:57,109 --> 00:44:03,230
responsible and if we look at things

00:44:00,619 --> 00:44:09,589
like forestry right how did how did we

00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:12,859
convince paper companies to use of wood

00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:15,230
pulp from sustainable for us when you

00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:17,480
look at hopefully if you look at your

00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:20,599
your cup and I'm hoping that these cups

00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:24,170
have it on it you'll see these days on

00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:28,820
paper products the forestry stewardship

00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:33,680
council symbol right and so what what

00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:38,810
made a change there was that we by

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:41,390
raising public awareness and almost by

00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:47,650
shaming the non-compliant companies we

00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:50,540
developed an expectation around what the

00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:54,260
corporation should be doing and I think

00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:57,369
that we need to as consumers demand that

00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:59,990
of providers of technology to us

00:44:57,369 --> 00:45:02,240
conversely when we're making the

00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:04,700
argument to our own companies we need to

00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,420
make that same argument we could release

00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:11,300
this non updateable we hope it's secure

00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:15,710
but we really don't know a embedded

00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:17,240
system or or we could do it right we

00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:19,820
could use an industry standard platform

00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:22,490
so that when those bugs are ultimately

00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:24,980
found there's a mechanism in place for

00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:27,440
it to be updated and by working with the

00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:29,869
industry standard platform in that

00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,420
consortium we can keep we can cut our

00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:34,280
costs right we will contribute towards

00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:38,330
that but it's going to be a fraction of

00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:41,599
what it would cost us to develop such a

00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:42,890
quality platform independently and so I

00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,650
think those are the two angles we have

00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:48,109
to come at it the one is share them

00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:50,920
share the load so that you're not

00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:53,839
burying the full cost yourself but also

00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,940
there needs to be some pressure on the

00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:58,880
industry players to say

00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:02,000
it's not acceptable that you're shipping

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,380
not updatable firmware that's you know

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,930
in fact we're not we're not going to buy

00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:17,530
a device that's that's got those

00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:24,380
qualities Hadrian because they provide

00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:31,039
service and more people using paper

00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:34,490
by and able t blame the company for many

00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:37,759
dollars as far as consumers so it's a

00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:40,309
very very simple answer for what but

00:46:37,759 --> 00:46:42,410
what complicates that what complicates

00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:45,470
that is that we never had to think about

00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:48,140
that with the predecessor devices so the

00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:49,640
predecessor to that smart thermostat you

00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:53,029
never had to worry about whether it was

00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,619
updatable the predecessor to the to the

00:46:53,029 --> 00:46:56,450
industrial device that we were working

00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:57,920
with you never had to worry about

00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:00,200
whether those things were updatable so

00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,809
it's not in our consumer mindset to

00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,250
think about some of those pieces and I

00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:08,539
think we need to become better educated

00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:22,199
ends and more effective in swinging our

00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:27,399
economic weight around yes restaurant

00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:29,919
Toronto City evaluates every eating

00:47:27,399 --> 00:47:33,159
establishment here soon red yellow or

00:47:29,919 --> 00:47:39,099
green that's right it is the government

00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:41,289
or some body to evaluate all the

00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:45,189
thermostats and all the drones and

00:47:41,289 --> 00:47:49,269
everything give them a green security so

00:47:45,189 --> 00:47:53,439
here's a question given the choice of

00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:57,159
having the government step in and try

00:47:53,439 --> 00:48:01,449
and devise an up-to-the-minute program

00:47:57,159 --> 00:48:06,099
for ensuring you know safety and

00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:08,499
embedded systems or having the industry

00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:11,289
do that directly in response to economic

00:48:08,499 --> 00:48:14,949
pressure you take a look at those two

00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:19,089
things and you think which which moves

00:48:14,949 --> 00:48:21,429
faster which is is going to end up being

00:48:19,089 --> 00:48:23,109
ultimately the most effective and I

00:48:21,429 --> 00:48:26,549
would agree with you that we probably

00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:29,219
need a combination of those two pieces

00:48:26,549 --> 00:48:31,859
but I think in a lot of cases at the

00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:34,599
government if you look at a government

00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:36,669
policy on on internet connectivity and

00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:41,009
other things they're struggling to keep

00:48:36,669 --> 00:48:41,009
up with the state of these technology

00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:49,750
right right

00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:55,099
right over

00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:58,010
that's underwriter glad you could say

00:48:55,099 --> 00:49:01,150
it's a requirement you can expand the

00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:01,150
state's requirement for

00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:08,490
there's a process for each Folsom's

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,490
effective dangerous

00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,820
drastic

00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:27,680
Yeah right interesting that you

00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:29,510
mentioned underwriter labs you see the

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:33,470
UL certification on many electrical

00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:35,600
devices an underwriter is a is somebody

00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:38,960
that's ensuring something and actually

00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:41,150
it's it's interesting to the insurance

00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,480
industry that the devices that you have

00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:47,000
in your house and business are safe and

00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:49,910
actually if there is a liability to the

00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,560
insurer for some of the digital risks

00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:53,869
that we are encountering going forward

00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:56,140
then that may actually be an avenue to

00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:59,030
put some pressure on those companies to

00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:03,460
to toe the line we've talked a lot about

00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:06,080
security and I want to just in closing

00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:08,300
draw attention to the fact that this is

00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,400
about more than security on the the

00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,950
small IOT range security yes that's

00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,300
important but there's other important

00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:15,830
features here and this is really where I

00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,840
was talking about the enterprise angle

00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:19,550
there's other important features that we

00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:22,340
need to pull in we already know how to

00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:24,020
do high availability we already have

00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,000
know how to do predictive failure

00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,580
analysis we need to bring those

00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:34,090
technologies from that that one scope

00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:37,910
into into this super embedded space no

00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:39,890
Andrew in terms of standardization he

00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:42,859
mentioned the Linux kernel and I'm not

00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:46,730
sure I see the faribault the colonel I

00:50:42,859 --> 00:50:48,680
think was as popular as it was because

00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:50,359
it's a general-purpose system you can

00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,240
use on a cell phone to run to a server

00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:56,720
farm and everything with embedded

00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:58,220
systems you have 10 million unrelated

00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,300
separate systems that don't really go

00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:02,600
together oncol together because

00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:06,330
small so what are the chances of

00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:09,270
arriving at a consensus plenty of

00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:12,210
different goals and not much overlap so

00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:18,030
let me draw a box around that the vast

00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:22,980
majority of deployed small embedded

00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:26,040
systems are going to be running one of a

00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:27,840
very small handful of processors right

00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:31,170
it's going to be something in the the

00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:33,300
arm cortex-m or possibly cortex our

00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:35,010
family or there's a couple of other

00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,360
alternatives to that an arm has a huge

00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,680
market share but there's some other

00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,330
companies that have significant market

00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,550
share so you're not dealing with

00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:42,750
hundreds of diverse architectures right

00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:44,790
you're dealing with a fairly fairly

00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:46,710
small set you're dealing with very

00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:49,800
similar requirements right a sensor

00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:51,540
style IOT device has some kind of

00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,520
sensing that's unique to that device and

00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:56,460
then it's got a communication stack it's

00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,840
got tcp/ip or bluetooth or zigbee or

00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,340
whatever it's going to standardized

00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,650
communication stack that every other

00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:03,990
device that uses that same protocol has

00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:07,770
the same stack right so there's there's

00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:10,200
a bunch of common software pieces the

00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:14,520
the underlying piece the scheduler the

00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:18,300
the event loops if you will the

00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:20,520
communication protocols and that is

00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,870
probably 90 plus percent of your

00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,540
software stack and then you've got the

00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:25,560
little piece of code there for whatever

00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:29,490
it is that you're actually trying to

00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:31,500
sense so why not collaborate why not

00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:33,600
share the cost of developing that ninety

00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,250
percent piece of code with the rest of

00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:39,360
the industry rather than building your

00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:47,010
own thing that you have to maintain

00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:49,520
forever as as a independent company and

00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:49,520
one last question

00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:02,530
so if you rewind a couple of decades

00:53:00,569 --> 00:53:04,210
artificial intelligence was a

00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:06,819
non-starter we didn't have the

00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:08,859
horsepower to make it happen recently I

00:53:06,819 --> 00:53:10,750
saw we put it on the shelf right we put

00:53:08,859 --> 00:53:14,589
AI in neural nets and all kinds of stuff

00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:17,230
on the shelf and recently over the past

00:53:14,589 --> 00:53:20,349
few years we've dusted that off we've

00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:22,150
got we realize hey we've we've got the

00:53:20,349 --> 00:53:23,710
performance levels where we can pull

00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:25,780
that technology that we're working on

00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:28,180
years ago we shelved we can pull that

00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:30,099
off the shelf dust it off update it and

00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:32,410
we've got the levels of performance

00:53:30,099 --> 00:53:33,760
where we can actually do some real

00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:35,400
machine learning some real neural

00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,099
networks and you know all of those

00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:41,050
related technologies so whether you

00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:43,829
believe in it or not it's here right

00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:47,349
it's it's something that's in use it's a

00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:52,329
significant part of our digital economy

00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:54,040
and our digital lives I'm not sure that

00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:57,910
that's going to lead to the singularity

00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:59,079
in the very short term but I don't even

00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:00,730
think there's a question of do you

00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:04,859
believe in machine learning it's it's

00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:04,859
it's here it's part of our lives

00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:11,599
right that's there's a threshold there

00:54:10,339 --> 00:54:14,059
right as soon as you make a program

00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:16,579
smart enough to make itself and then you

00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:18,259
go one step beyond that then potentially

00:54:16,579 --> 00:54:20,440
you've got you've got the death spiral

00:54:18,259 --> 00:54:23,089
and fortunately there are some people

00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:26,210
like Elon Musk and some companies like

00:54:23,089 --> 00:54:29,180
Google that are are already planning and

00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:30,859
kill switches from the beginning and so

00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:33,259
that's that's a kind of interesting

00:54:30,859 --> 00:54:37,569
development in that space all right

00:54:33,259 --> 00:54:37,569
thank you very much for your attention

00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:41,139
[Applause]
