Title: FSOSS 2016: How to Completely Fail at Open-Sourcing
Publication date: 2016-11-26
Playlist: FSOSS 2016
Description: 
	Speaker: Sean Stephens, CEO with PerfectlySoft

"Open-Source your product", they said. "It will be great", they said. But what if you have never been involved with an open-source community before? In this example talk, we'll show you exactly not what to do when taking your 20-year old product open-source. How not to dress, what not to say, how not to do marketing, how not to grow a community and how to get other groups to spin off other products and leave you wondering what the heck just happened. All based on the recent experience of taking a popular server-side language with significant buzz open-sourced and gradually making every community mistake imaginable.

I have the pleasant experience of the

00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,009
almost the last hour of the day and I

00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,290
decided that I would give you the

00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:18,200
biggest and longest and most packed

00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,849
presentation I possibly could so I hope

00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,990
everybody I wake everybody up so

00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:23,779
everybody goes home and is ready for

00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,070
tomorrow I have a lot of stuff to go

00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:27,439
through but actually the key point

00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,539
they're going to take away today is is

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,699
that it could be the purpose of my life

00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:36,470
is to only serve as a warning to others

00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:37,879
today I actually have four presentations

00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,710
I'm going to go through there are four

00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:41,540
different stories that I hope you enjoy

00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,879
those stories and they all kind of fit

00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,010
together so I hope you enjoy each one of

00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:47,449
those stories the first story going to

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,170
tell you about is actually this is my

00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:53,629
story now I'm in my 40s so I have a long

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,640
story but I tell you a little bit of

00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:58,159
that I love the story where it starts is

00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,280
actually my parents where I was born I

00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:03,110
was actually I started my life on a farm

00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,350
my father was a philosopher you can see

00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:09,860
a picture of him up here he had the

00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:13,760
Marxist beard and the lumbersexual look

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:15,530
about him and and he was a philosopher

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,910
actually it was a philosopher that

00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:18,740
started dairy farming because he

00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,450
believed that the corporation's of the

00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,610
world were evil and that in fact we

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,260
should go back to grassroots but

00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,750
unfortunately due to the Canadian

00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,510
recession in the 80s that we actually

00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:32,990
went bankrupt the family and so we moved

00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,580
to the Angolan Civil War makes sense so

00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,790
then I spent the rest of my childhood in

00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,860
the Angolan Civil War learning and doing

00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,900
things there and and moved around who

00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,940
was my father did was called deep rural

00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,200
capacity building that was going on in

00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,540
the middle of absolutely nowhere and

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,010
helping people drill wells and do all

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,640
sorts of crazy things they would follow

00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:55,220
him around it's interesting because i'll

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,930
talk about this later but i was for

00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,600
hundreds of thousands of people the

00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,409
first white child that they'd ever seen

00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,120
because I go out in the middle of the

00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:04,130
depths of Africa and people come over

00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,020
and touch me and look at me I'm probably

00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,420
the only developer that you've ever seen

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,390
or met that has feels weird if people

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,760
aren't staring at him all the time

00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,830
that's why and in fact my parents

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,810
dragged me around the world I was in 60

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:19,400
countries before I was 12 so

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,080
I was all over the place all the time

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,340
i'm not going to go through all the

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,900
stories of that but there were a lot

00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,220
there is another interesting story that

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,900
when that is that my parents worked for

00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,660
a while for world vision and World

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,520
Vision believed that as I was reminded

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,430
that i was at the tom cochrane opening

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,349
this week for life is a highway if you

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:38,000
remember that song so Tom Cochrane is

00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:39,650
going around with World Vision at the

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,200
same place that I was at the same time

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,420
but World Vision arranged for me to get

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,950
a computer in the depths of Africa I was

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,110
probably only kid in the world who had a

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,180
monkey and a computer at that time in

00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,790
history what's interesting though is

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,920
that then I decided not to go into

00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,510
computers and stuff but I went to bible

00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,430
school then i tried to do my hand at

00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,510
medical school then i decided i wanted

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,700
to change the world I wanted to do

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,230
something big so I just had to go to

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,780
journalism school and see if I could

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,700
tell everybody about how the world is

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,200
changing and what was happening and then

00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,230
I realized what journalism really was

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,480
and so I decided to become a politician

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,640
that's just like this and then I realize

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,410
what politics really was they went to

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,120
that either that whole time I was sort

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,489
of I was environmentally minded i was

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,019
involved in tree planting a tree planter

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:26,600
for seven years adult sorts of crazy

00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:28,220
things during that period i actually

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,160
during school I took all sorts of

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,260
courses on programming and actually got

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,760
as I was a beginning of the internet the

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,410
internet had just started and I found it

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,959
so exciting and I wanted to be part of

00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,730
that but then I decided to do something

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,230
else and became a professional musician

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:46,639
I made multiple records and actually

00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,470
four of those records to see up here you

00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,180
can I get you can get at least one still

00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,060
on iTunes made the top ten on college

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,220
stations very proud of that but in fact

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,930
they found that there was no money in

00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,340
music but I really i felt that Valley

00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,840
being a musician I could teach the whole

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,850
world and tell the world of all things

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,100
that were changing all these cool things

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:07,519
but we didn't really work because I was

00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,170
broke all the time so in order to sort

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,150
of survive what I did is I actually

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,680
became people's computer guy and

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,389
actually started working for a computer

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,430
company and doing computer things and

00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:17,750
that's when I really when I was like the

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,359
internet this thing is going to change

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,490
everything I have to get involved in

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:23,539
this and so my grandmother had an art

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,669
gallery and I said I'm going to take

00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:28,370
your art gallery and I'm going to put it

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:30,080
online that's why did I got a grant from

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,460
the government that I started what may

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,600
be the world's first art gallery

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,610
there's lots of people coming up with

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,380
ideas at that time I took thousands of

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,270
artists paintings took pictures of them

00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,680
and put them on the Internet I will tell

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,530
you this is the stupidest idea in

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,090
history I never sold a painting I spent

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,699
years of my life trying to make it work

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:49,669
it didn't but what did happen is I

00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:51,590
bumped into a guy who had an agency the

00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:53,150
agency was called tree frog there's a

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,130
digital marketing agency they made

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,229
websites at that point it hits CD ROMs

00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,150
and flash stuff which is sort of a dead

00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:02,300
idea and so there was three of us

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:05,720
sitting around a designer myself and a

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,560
sales company guy and and everyone said

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,270
okay what are we gonna do and the

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,190
designer said walking to design and the

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,220
other company guy said I'm going to do

00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,210
sales and the third person is me does

00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,650
like I don't know what I'm going to do

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,500
and he said well somebody needs to

00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,690
program I was like well who's going to

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,599
do the Hat like you're gonna do that and

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,570
so I had up sort of inheriting the job

00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:28,550
of developer somehow and I started it

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,139
was actually this moment where I there

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,580
was two CDs that had come in the mail

00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:33,919
because back then you got CDs in the

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,780
mail and one was really pretty from a

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,849
company called la Sol and the other one

00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,500
was not so pretty from a company called

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:42,169
tango and we decided to go with the

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:46,669
pretty seedy so that's how I became a

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:47,900
lasso developer so before I switch stars

00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:49,699
I did want to just make sure you caught

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,800
all these points that one I am in fact

00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:54,710
the developer although i have CEO is a

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,960
title now i do love being the center of

00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,830
attention for the excuses that i gave

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,270
earlier and i am i indeed ambitious but

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,560
it's not just ambition to take

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,729
everyone's money and run away with it

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,620
it's actually ambition because i truly

00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:08,479
believe through this sort of life of

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,099
that I've had that I can make help make

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,199
the world a better place and what's

00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:13,909
interesting is I also believe because of

00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,530
the internet that the internet is making

00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:16,909
life better I mean I grew up in Africa I

00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:18,710
see how the rest of the world works and

00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,150
when I have to go into not having

00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,930
internet for about five minutes I start

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:26,659
to freak out now let me quickly tell you

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,460
the story of tree frog the story of tree

00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:30,469
frog today is is that now we're pushing

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,789
40 people it's up a new market fair up a

00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:34,969

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
got a sleep room in case you get a

00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:20,259
little snoozy they've got an electric

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,550
car so I've been during the day need to

00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:23,949
go grab some lunch you can jump in the

00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,740
car and go go ride on it but the fact is

00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:28,360
all of this stuff for those of you who

00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,599
are looking for work or for those of you

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:35,650
know going it the reality is that's all

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,479
just fluff honestly it's fluff I'll tell

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,060
you though that I do believe in the idea

00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,639
of innovation owl everyone in here

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,719
because during an innovative environment

00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,129
we're all thinking what innovation is a

00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:46,539
technical thing I actually believe

00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:48,159
innovations more than this technical

00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:49,810
innovation is actually about business

00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:51,669
it's about the way we work it's a way we

00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:55,449
think innovation isn't just about

00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:56,919
technology I do have a belief and in

00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,779
fact did a TED talk on this if you want

00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:01,599
to get more of these ideas and go check

00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:02,889
me on Ted this concept that there were

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,050
these great ideas there are these things

00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:07,419
that became frameworks those frameworks

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,729
became rules those rules we start to see

00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:12,520
as truth and that they're not

00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:13,659
necessarily true in fact many of the

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,080
frameworks that we use today for

00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,639
everyday life and even in technology

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,279
somebody said in the last talk that I

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,629
was at you know the everything the the

00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,349
standards that we have on the desktop

00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:27,969
suck and reality is true in many cases

00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:29,469
because of a framework as somebody came

00:08:27,969 --> 00:08:32,500
up with a nobody bothered to challenge

00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:33,729
them so we just kept on using them well

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,740
there's a couple of big lies that I want

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:38,110
to challenge one of those the big lies

00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,260
is that businesses exclusively exist for

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:44,320
profit and the idea is that this came

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,420
out of a hundred year old idea that you

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,430
start with a product or service and

00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,980
around that product or service you build

00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,910
operations to make the product or

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,980
service happen around

00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,800
that you build a sales team to go sell

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,900
that stuff and then around that you try

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,610
and sell that as many times as you can

00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,890
execute it and the more times you do

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:08,170
that the more money you make and you win

00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:10,480
the game right but in fact the goal of

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:14,080
all of these companies is profit that's

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,430
not necessarily a good thing so in fact

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,480
when with tree frog we've said look

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,100
let's have a completely different

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,050
philosophy let's start with the idea

00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,940
that we want to help people be

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,710
successful then we want to change the

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,980
way the world works you want to make it

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:28,300
better in all different ways around that

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,660
we're going to find a bunch of people

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,730
that love doing that with us around that

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,710
we're going to go find clients that like

00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,940
to do that with us and around that we're

00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,080
going to try and figure out what

00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,960
activities we're going to do that will

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,690
help them be successful and what's

00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,510
interesting is we still have to have

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,760
profit what I mean by profit is really

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:52,210
just free cash flow if you spend more

00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,370
money than you make you die profit is

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,780
like breathing you have to have it it

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,960
just shouldn't be the focus of why you

00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,670
exist on top of that we also believe

00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,470
that the people that we work with should

00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,510
be successful they should be happy they

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,070
should enjoy what they do and our

00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,780
clients should be successful we

00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,100
shouldn't just be selling schlock we

00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:13,090
should actually do things that

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,320
meaningfully help people we also think

00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,840
that whatever we're doing should

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,370
genuinely not damaged or promote or be

00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,430
good for the environment so we try and

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,020
have carbon neutral attitude and also we

00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,490
have to think about our community and

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,710
when I mean my community are our

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,710
community I mean our local community and

00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:32,230
I also mean our international community

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:35,920
this is a huge philosophical leap from

00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,840
the exclusive focus on profit what's

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,560
also interesting about this is that no

00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,420
one stakeholder can win you can't damage

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,940
the environment for profits sake we all

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,430
know that but you also can't damage your

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,560
team for profit cig and you shouldn't be

00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,960
damaging your community for your team's

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,760
sake so having all of these things in

00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:00,070
alignment is really a meaningful idea as

00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,720
well I believe there's some other big

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,640
lies out there another example would be

00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,410
a work-life balance is key so the idea

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,629
that we all started with is a

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,610
to your old idea again that you should

00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:11,769
work eight hours play eight hours and

00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,600
sleep eight hours this actually came out

00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:15,220
because kids were being forced to work

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,660
17 hours a day and somebody said that's

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,399
probably inappropriate let's only make

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,709
them work 12 hours and eventually they

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,389
came back to this system was a fairly

00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:23,920
fair system but then what they do is

00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,819
they say look what we're going to do is

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,870
we're going to make you work in the

00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:27,399
middle of the day because that's the

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,319
best and most productive part of the day

00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,230
so we're going to break up your play to

00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:33,699
be on both sides and then of course we

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,170
didn't get into this which is how houses

00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:36,879
and stuff you have to commute to work

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,949
and you have to do is play time because

00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,689
we love to commute right so you're going

00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:42,069
to live but I live a new market the

00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:44,319
average commute is an hour and 10

00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:46,839
minutes both ways that's two hours and

00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:49,750
20 minutes average commute that is

00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,949
insanity I'm sorry so but that's another

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,910
thing you do during your playtime and of

00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:54,250
course now you have to get your kids

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,230
ready for school and get lunches made

00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,759
and do all that other stuff so play

00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:01,990
actually gets compressed and it

00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:04,810
disappears and in fact the the big idea

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:07,000
around this is that work is hard and

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:10,779
miserable and you get paid for the data

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,850
suck that's what the moneys for this is

00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,160
a broken idea what we all agree that

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,019
there has to be something better and in

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,209
fact is with this eight hour day nine to

00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:21,880
five thing many companies to fix this

00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:24,370
already like help your help move close

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,189
would be closer that's a simple thing

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:29,050
you can do go shopping on a Tuesday not

00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:30,730
a final co-op with everybody else is

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,009
shopping I mean just just be more

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,019
efficient as a group of programmers and

00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:36,819
developers probably in this room you

00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:38,529
already know this just find other ways

00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:39,850
to be efficient and run multiple things

00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:43,829
at the same time programmers going to

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:45,790
change the world if they haven't already

00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:48,610
there's another big lie which I believe

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:51,040
which is retirement is the key so

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,660
everybody in this room the people the

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,889
idea of retirement for those of you who

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,990
have already tired i think is a

00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:57,459
ridiculous idea it's an idea that was

00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,500
born sort of out of the 50s and 40s

00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:00,490
where you take all of that work from the

00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,610
whole life because you didn't have any

00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:06,399
play left and you'd do it after 65 which

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,720
is to me a broken idea especially

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,160
because most of the people in this room

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,050
are going to live longer than their

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,100
parents did on average and some of the

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,850
people in this room are going to live to

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,899
be 150 years old that's a reality and if

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,699
that's a reality we're going to live

00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:20,939
that long why

00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:24,329
would we want to go play golf for 75

00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:26,489
years or 85 years after its kind of

00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:28,319
ridiculous notice you guys I have this

00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:31,199
realization my grandfather was 86 years

00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:36,059
old still working full time and I was 36

00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:39,179
and I went I have 50 years left so if I

00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:40,859
have 50 years of work left why would I

00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:43,079
be creating a company that's going to

00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:44,790
last three to five years exit get rich

00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,919
and go do something else this is another

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,019
broken idea that we're trying to get

00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,609
rich quick and we're not thinking about

00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,290
companies and thinking about big ideas

00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:54,869
and how to make the world change in a

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,970
bigger way so my grandfather work till

00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:58,230
he's 86 that was 50 years and I when you

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,389
know if we're going to talk about 50

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,069
years I could potentially last a lot

00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:04,470
longer why don't we start thinking about

00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:06,899
building companies that last a thousand

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,449
years so my goal is to turn tree frog

00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:13,529
which is only 40 people and to come that

00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:15,389
it can last 40 years that's hard and

00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:16,769
what we do is we've said look I know I'm

00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:18,839
not going to be alive in a thousand

00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:20,819
years maybe but probably unlikely

00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,339
probably uploaded myself to the internet

00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:25,139
if I last that long but the reality is

00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:28,199
it's the way we do things that lasts a

00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:30,779
thousand years and so part of it is how

00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:32,519
do we do things and getting everybody to

00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,749
agree on let's do these things let's

00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,029
have standards but the standard

00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:38,129
shouldn't just be what the how the math

00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:39,329
works and how we the network protocols

00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:42,329
it's just to be how we treat each other

00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:44,789
and and and how we are collaborative and

00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:48,359
innovative and enthusiastic in our day

00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:50,039
to day life so the idea really behind

00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:52,439
this is it is a company that I want to

00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,699
work at and I know I'm going to be there

00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:55,289
four hundred years so I want to build a

00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,999
company of people that I love to be

00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:58,439
around and it's not about throwing

00:14:56,999 --> 00:15:01,259
everything out it's about rethinking

00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:02,850
everything there's a few more things

00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:04,919
that are very relevant for later on in

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:08,459
the presentation before I move on one is

00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:11,549
you'll notice I'm wearing a suit nobody

00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:13,529
else is right I'm the only guy in the

00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:16,589
room wearing a suit it's funny because

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:19,199
what happened was is I used to be on a

00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:21,359
quarter Hawaiian I used to wear Hawaiian

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,699
shirts all the time that's all I war and

00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:26,189
I was so proud pajama pants Hawaiian

00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:28,289
shirt that was me as developer starting

00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:29,939
tree frog and I was so proud that I did

00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:30,930
not have to wear you know the monkey

00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:32,910
suit because it was that

00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,270
ridiculous that I got to war whatever I

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:37,470
wanted to and then one I hired someone

00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,730
who came to work a tree frog and they

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,860
looked at me and they said this company

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,230
is never going to go anywhere unless you

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,230
start dressing that for the job that you

00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:48,510
want not the job that you have I said

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:50,370
okay that's a good theory I'll take you

00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,080
up on that so we went out then we've got

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:53,279
a nice shirt and nice pair of pants and

00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,500
I went back and the very next day I had

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,029
a meeting and I signed a deal that I

00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,770
would never have had the capacity to do

00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:00,240
and within about three months I was

00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,130
wearing suits all the time and it

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,779
literally changed my life I literally

00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,700
became as like a key I could walk in any

00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:07,050
door I've got a suit on I can go

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,720
anywhere it's amazing it's like I have a

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,040
suit of armor meets pajamas and in fact

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,899
now I have my suits are made by the same

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,660
guy who makes the suits for the suits

00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:17,160
show suits and I got to tell you this is

00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,470
the most comfortable suit this is like

00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,180
wearing pajamas I highly recommend well

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,680
you take one thing away from this you

00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:26,310
have to get a custom-made suit before

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:28,380
you die the other thing is you may

00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,240
notice I have green hair right now

00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,040
tensioning what the green hair is this

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,170
started on you know because i was i was

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,750
musician right this was vestigial in a

00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,420
way and i decided i'd put a little bit

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,650
of color of my hair just be crazy and

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,110
everybody started knowing me as the

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:46,980
crazy haired guy and as you've noticed

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:51,180
it's now jump to the shark but in fact

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:52,770
excuse me i have all of these benefits

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,839
by having green hair i can walk into a

00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,880
room of people like this and everyone

00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,010
remember the ridiculous looking guy with

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,560
the green hair I'm like one step from a

00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:04,110
squishy nose right and some lots of big

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,240
red shoes there's been a huge asset to

00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:08,400
me as the business has grown to wear

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,380
suit have green hair and the last but

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,620
not least is I call myself a CEO now a

00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,959
CEO of a company of two people is kind

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,839
of ridiculous title that's like calling

00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,069
myself Grand Poobah of the universe but

00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,600
where's the math like if you have a

00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:23,550
company of two people you are you not a

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,050
CEO what about a company of a thousand

00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,089
people are you CEO now look how do you

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,730
know when you're CEO and when you're

00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,530
just another I get regular guy and in

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:32,880
fact what happened was I was a I just

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,500
called myself senior developer we were

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,750
10 people I had seen you develop a web

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,040
his business card and I was giving that

00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,570
out and people like no I want to talk to

00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,340
the one to talk to the boss I'm like no

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,290
and bus now I want to talk to the boss

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,260
boss

00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:48,800
now I have CEO my card and it's like a

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,300
key it gets me in the doors I can pick

00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,310
up a phone and say hey I'm the CEO of

00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,310
this new person the company be but I

00:17:52,310 --> 00:18:00,260
just say I'm the CEO and I get there so

00:17:55,310 --> 00:18:02,480
I'm just saying that's why I haven't

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:07,100
done a story for you this is quick skip

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,420
the story of la Sol Sol la so I actually

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,070
going to start with another story which

00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,510
the story of Apple I know everyone has

00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,210
to put apple in a presentation but this

00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:16,610
time it actually really is really

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,240
contextual so you guys may remember so

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,440
read about what I was born apple began

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,820
and after a while it was started to do

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,580
really well so they decided they were

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,410
going to go hire a CEO which is a CEO of

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,200
there's pepsi cola coke i can't remember

00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:34,070
which one perhaps he was pepsi thank you

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,270
so I was the CEO Pepsi so and then they

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,680
came up with the mac you guys have all

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,150
seen so many of you have seen you at

00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,780
least one of you has seemed to seen the

00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:43,610
book or read the movie but he'll

00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:47,750
remember that at one point jobs got

00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:49,310
pissed off and left right so he left and

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,720
then they continued they continue moving

00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,370
forward another company started called

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,400
FileMaker anybody heard of FileMaker a

00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:58,100
couple of you there you go so continuing

00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,810
the story on and john skelly decided he

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,370
was going to split the company into two

00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,200
parts he was going to have a hardware

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,420
company called Apple computers and a

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,460
software company called claris so anyway

00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:10,280
I remember claris well it's dates you

00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,140
all if you do i'm sorry but claire has

00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,700
decided they wanted to compete against

00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,590
Microsoft Office least that's what I

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,330
think so they sort of buying up all of

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,310
these different software's to try and

00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,380
compete one of the software pieces they

00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:24,170
bought was a company called FileMaker

00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,750
that was sort of the access of the of

00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,850
the claris group so fast forward a

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,770
little bit and all sorts of crazy things

00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,260
happen one is the internet started to

00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,790
come out and a company realized that

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,170
they could actually connect FileMaker

00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,690
with the internet and you could have

00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:42,620
these dynamic websites that did stuff it

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:44,630
was insane back then obviously and fast

00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,880
forward a little bit and Apple realized

00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,890
hey this company that's figure this out

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,170
this is genius we should put this as

00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,570
part of klaris so they licensed the

00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,919
whole thing and they stuck it into what

00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,769
is now called

00:19:54,919 --> 00:20:01,190
which was claris was called Claire's

00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:03,169
dynamic markup language CD ml fast

00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:07,009
forward a little bit more and the

00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:10,970
unthinkable happened jobs decided he

00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:12,649
would come back and he killed claris out

00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,139
of 90 products have you read the book

00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:17,869
they went down to 10 10 products that

00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:20,690
got the boot was this programming

00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:22,100
language called la so it got lost when

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,100
of course it was a closed source

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:27,109
language right so all the people using

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,249
it we're like no what about our stuff

00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:29,480
what we're going to do is the company

00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:30,440
said hey let's continue were going to

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,389
build this we're gonna make this huge

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,369
company out of this language called la

00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:35,840
so now I'm not going to get into the

00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:36,739
entire history because you guys many of

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,200
you in this room probably another

00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:41,269
history better than I do but if we look

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,350
like in a hundred years people look back

00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:44,720
they're going to be like there was this

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,909
one moment there's actually a few years

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,649
where all of these languages came out

00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:50,989
all of these ideas all of these cool

00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:53,239
things we had Ruby which later became

00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:54,679
rails and PHP and Java and everything

00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:56,539
started to build web stuff because it

00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:00,080
just kind of exploded as is insane

00:20:56,539 --> 00:21:02,090
explosion of ideas and in fact if you

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,499
look at it from a different angle I like

00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:06,230
to joke about this back in that those

00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:07,820
days I have friends I call them sort of

00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:10,249
cultures and you guys can probably

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,019
correct me on all this but I have some

00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:14,419
friends who went the guidance counselor

00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:15,769
and said what should I do with the rest

00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:17,570
of my life the guidance counselor was

00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:19,340
like well you're smart you should go

00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,710
into computers there's big money there

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,059
right but not having ever used a

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,259
computer before they're like you should

00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:26,059
go into Microsoft because that's what

00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:28,070
computers is and they got sucked in the

00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:29,629
Microsoft culture these other people

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,700
were like hacking in their basement with

00:21:29,629 --> 00:21:33,889
stuff and making things work and they

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,809
sort of got into the Linux eek or

00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:38,509
hacking culture you might want to call

00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:40,460
it anyway you got this this lamp stack

00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:42,649
and you got these standards within this

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,820
lamp stack I'm not going to go too deep

00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:46,369
into this tour to here and talking about

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,970
the next door but the idea was is that

00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:52,609
of course we had instead of building

00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:54,409
every last little thing all by yourself

00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:56,480
every single time in machine language

00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:59,210
that seemed ridiculous all of these

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,919
frameworks sprung up around this so you

00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,749
could build on top of things so that you

00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,820
could create web servers so you could

00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:06,590
send information and one of the things

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,000
that lasso had and did some other

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,800
special had some

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,330
special sauce which other languages

00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,880
didn't do for example at just-in-time

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:15,350
compilation I guess there's all sorts of

00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:20,780
stuff that lasso did which is really

00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:22,550
neat it was it had where should I go I

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,670
could talk about literally lasso for

00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:28,790
hours about how neat it was we had a

00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:31,040
really compelling threading model we had

00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:33,830
unicode support before everybody else

00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,090
did we had all sorts of different things

00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:37,100
and one of the biggest things of course

00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:39,530
that lasso had as well as the technology

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,180
there was some security realities behind

00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,910
it what even more so was it had an

00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:47,630
amazing community there was a community

00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:50,570
of is a community of guys who learned

00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:52,460
how to develop stuff in the 90s and just

00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:54,980
kept building and kept building and kind

00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,570
of went all insular and what disappeared

00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,460
in other basements of their houses and

00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:01,310
kept building stuff and are still

00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,200
building stuff today in LA so and this

00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:05,450
whole group though is all fundamentally

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,760
based around a closed source language

00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:10,550
and in fact today there are still

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,560
hundreds of universities and all sorts

00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,720
of crazy things the stories of where

00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,180
lasso ended up as this language that

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,950
sort of grew is astonishing and yet

00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:22,340
probably no one in this room has heard

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:25,840
of it anyone heard of LA so 1 that's

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,840
good that's statistically appropriate

00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:34,220
especially since he's one of the primary

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:35,900
lawsuit developers but anyway good now

00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:39,170
Lhasa had some really neat stuff in that

00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,880
it was so simplistic to use they sort of

00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,530
had that Apple DNA we like to think

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,940
about it where I could literally just

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,230
type the word date wrapped with some

00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,270
brackets and it would spit up the date

00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,560
that I could easily manipulate it and I

00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,630
could use it an embedded way or a

00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,300
scripted way and so was it sort of made

00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:55,220
it really easy to use but it was a close

00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,640
source language this if I remember

00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:02,260
correctly what is the theme of this

00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:05,250
conference is open source

00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:08,220
was futile exactly resistance was futile

00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:10,390
this is not an open source language and

00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,680
one of the problems with that is if you

00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,540
looked at the user base if you looked at

00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,730
the revenue it was generating because it

00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,440
was still selling server by server like

00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,540
in the most old-fashioned way possible

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,860
the revenue was going down and down and

00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:25,360
down and down now tree frog this really

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,220
interesting philosophical company was

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,650
using lasso for everything it did in

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:33,400
fact still does use lasso for much of

00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:36,610
the stuff we do and we saw the fact that

00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,620
this language is about to die and we

00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,050
were right after the recession and went

00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,550
without do something about this so we

00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,600
said we should open sources language

00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,070
this would be the way I got to grab this

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,840
language something has to happen with it

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,700
so that it doesn't disappear you guys

00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,410
can all now that now that you look

00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,270
backwards in history you can imagine the

00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,650
fear of a company that's based on a

00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,660
product that's going to disappear at all

00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,610
your stuff is built in it that's that

00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,610
makes you panic that is a reason why

00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:02,830
open source is amazing well if you look

00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:05,950
at the history of this of this open a

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,330
closed source language it was with Apple

00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,620
but it got bought by an agency that I

00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,330
got bought by another agency which

00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,650
turned into another agency which got

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,660
popped by another agency I mean it's

00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,610
sordid history it's like a soap opera of

00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,010
purchasing in this then the intellectual

00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:20,320
property moving around and so in fact

00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:22,090
what we did ultimately is we managed to

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,440
convince them when we took on the debt

00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,970
and we actually bought the company

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,900
ourselves and brought all the people up

00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:31,150
to Canada so that whole thing moved here

00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,830
which is really neat and to get it

00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:35,530
rolling again we did all sorts of crazy

00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:38,200
things we ran conferences we came with

00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:42,760
up with new software we we we care with

00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:44,290
an eclipse version colossal lab we did

00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,640
all sorts of things to get the language

00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,620
and actually it started to roll once

00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,750
again so this amazing technology that

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,550
spent 20 years in development which is

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,630
all these neat things but was still

00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:57,550
closed source but there's a problem here

00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:00,580
so one of the problems was is that in

00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:02,170
fact the Canadian Department of Defense

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,790
uses this so does the American

00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,350
department offense battleships use it

00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:08,970
the UN uses it all of these companies

00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:11,020
used it I was talking with one of the

00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,390
most well-known developers in our

00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,140
community who is one of the senior

00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:18,050
security architects at PayPal

00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,430
and I said look you know let's talk

00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:22,190
about open source and he said open sir

00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:25,460
it's fundamentally more secure I said

00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,900
because it's closed source and if we

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,660
open source it we're just going to kind

00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,280
of make it unsecured now and he said no

00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,690
that's not the theory the theory is the

00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,180
theory of the glasslock which is

00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,320
something that is open source everyone

00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,750
could look at and tell you how to

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,840
improve it presuming everybody is a good

00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,910
person that's another discussion but the

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,240
problem was is that this wasn't designed

00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:49,190
from scratch to be open source this is a

00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,280
product that had just had a bunch of

00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:54,860
developers over 20 years shoveling stuff

00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,750
in so there were great beautiful parts

00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:59,540
of it and there was unbelievably ugly

00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:02,030
stuff in it and somewhere in that ugly

00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:04,910
stuff was security vulnerabilities that

00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:06,650
would literally directly and quickly

00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,320
affect national security had we just

00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:11,660
open sourced it randomly so now we're in

00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,640
a complete now we're screwed now we have

00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,770
this amazing product with these amazing

00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,720
ideas that have come out of these genius

00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:23,660
developers / over a period of time and

00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:25,940
we can't do anything with it Ben thing

00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,620
happened fast forward a little bit back

00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,590
to our Apple thing and a new language

00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:32,810
came out called Swift ever has anyone

00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:35,090
heard of Swift now we've got some people

00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:37,430
that have heard of script that's good so

00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:38,600
Swift got came out you get for those you

00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,810
don't know what it is it's a programming

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,490
language for iOS development you used to

00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:45,440
only be able to use objective-c now you

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,540
can use a new language called Swift and

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,610
when we first looked at it it looked so

00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,840
much like la so kind of scratched her

00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:52,070
head and went Wow well it came out of

00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,900
the same sort of I'd set of ideals

00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,540
assume either the sort of Apple sort of

00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,790
notions we said and actually our lead

00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:01,280
developer Kyle Jessup he said you know

00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:02,720
if i was to rewrite lasso again and not

00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,770
have to worry about it i would write

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:09,740
swift and something else then happened

00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:12,710
in 2015 now we have to close source

00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:14,060
languages la so which is a service our

00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:19,060
language and Swift which is a mobile

00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:21,680
language really iOS swift open sources

00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:24,440
now i can remember this point where I

00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,970
was like this is the we're dead like

00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,740
someone's going to go build a

00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:31,290
server-side variant of

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,330
swift and the loss of developers were

00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:35,460
like well nice knowing you after 20

00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:37,170
years boo by and I'll leave and go to

00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,450
the Swift world and so I was out

00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:41,730
drinking beer with the commiserating

00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:45,210
with the lead developer of LA so the

00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:49,260
father of LA so who started it in 1994

00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:50,850
and we said why don't we be that why

00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:54,090
don't we take all the cool ideas out of

00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:56,309
LA so and put them rebuild them in Swift

00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,750
and now we've we've taken all the ideas

00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:58,860
we open source to create a path for all

00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,510
of our development community and

00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,980
everything and we got the screw national

00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:05,100
security would actually move all those

00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,650
ideas and go into a new place answer

00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,970
said why not let's take those two ideas

00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,740
and squish them together and let's turn

00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:13,170
it into a new product and this now

00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,020
becomes a new story my next presentation

00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:19,140
on the story of perfect how am i doing

00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:21,059
for time so let's talk about let's talk

00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,200
about this for a second so I remember

00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:23,880
looking out on the internet because we

00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,710
weren't worried about this and you know

00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,960
we'll Swift ever be open source will

00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:31,140
there ever be a back-end for swift and

00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,730
people were basically saying no whoever

00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,990
wrote this article when can I quote him

00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:38,790
Swift on the server and his answer was

00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:41,760
probably never is was very wrong fast

00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:43,559
forward a little bit and tons of people

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,809
were talking about this idea that this

00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:47,370
would make an amazing back-end language

00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:49,530
would make it because because the way

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:53,280
it's written and and how performance it

00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:54,679
is and so the reality was is that we

00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,360
have this especially in the mobile space

00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:59,340
all of these different frameworks that

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,100
have sprung up over time server-side

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:04,980
frameworks and now client-side framework

00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,540
or languages and so there's a lot of as

00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,970
you guys all know if you're a developer

00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,410
you've got to learn multiple things and

00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,080
learn of interact and you don't get that

00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:14,520
that nice isomorphism we do in

00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,440
javascript and some other stuff out a

00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,360
higher level but you don't get it about

00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,870
a native level so we said look there's

00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,360
also cool ideas enter Swift it's got all

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:26,210
of these cool it's easy to read it's

00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,010
beautiful to work with people love it

00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:33,050
it's been all got all of the right

00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:35,940
things so there's also another thing i'm

00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:38,130
going to point out that the number of

00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,419
jobs in this because of iOS and app

00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:43,509
development is going crazy

00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:46,359
if you want a job you need to learn

00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:47,859
swift swift developers are like unicorns

00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:50,499
right now the like people are desperate

00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:51,970
for swift developers it's it's great

00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:53,710
because everyone wants to build apps

00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,970
with with them let's build an app but

00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,639
that's the only way to do it it's

00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:59,679
anchored there really and people who do

00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:01,179
use it if you look at stack overflow if

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,249
you look at other places people love

00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:05,230
this language like working with it it's

00:31:03,249 --> 00:31:10,090
natural feels natural so it was like

00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:14,859
pseudo code so we released after five

00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:18,730
months of work basically lasso 10 which

00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:20,619
was perfect we called it perfect we

00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:23,559
thought it was the perfect idea and it

00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:26,919
basically was the ability to write swift

00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:29,739
code on the server and immediately it

00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,629
started trending on github and for a

00:31:29,739 --> 00:31:33,700
week we were the top project on github

00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:35,950
which are very we I'd never been on

00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:41,230
github before first project on github

00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:44,289
wow that's very fun and more than that

00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:46,389
more than that is like the world went

00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:48,070
crazy I mean 24 hours later we were on

00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:49,869
the front page of Wired magazine like

00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:52,720
every magazine we were on the front page

00:31:49,869 --> 00:31:55,269
of their all this visibility we had like

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,999
Twitter followers just like coming like

00:31:55,269 --> 00:32:00,070
in the hundreds every day we had what

00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:03,149
else we have and you just it was crazy I

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:07,179
was very exciting and very fun and and

00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:10,359
crazy and back my favorite part was we

00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:11,710
were actually in at Times Square in

00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:13,720
London like on the big billboard shows

00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:17,259
like Lindsay Lohan on one board and us

00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,809
on the other board that was cool that

00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:21,759
was fun and basically it's not anything

00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:23,200
complex as you know the basic library of

00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:25,779
stuff that you need to do to do

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,100
server-side code there's the basic

00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:28,720
plug-in so it can do service so you can

00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,399
either attach the lamp stack and put me

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,379
know attach it as an Apache plugin or

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,879
run it as a standalone server and any

00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:37,359
data source connector you need

00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:38,710
everything from MySQL the Hadoop now the

00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,859
benefit is because of Swift's

00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:45,129
performance I mean it's way faster he'll

00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:47,259
in then Ruby obviously but then node and

00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:49,659
even Java it can take on in some cases

00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:52,750
and in some cases much faster than Java

00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:54,370
and so if you look at perfect

00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,870
but in terms of its raw performance

00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:57,730
third parties have now looked at it and

00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,500
said wow the performance of this because

00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,210
of all these benefits is astonishing

00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,790
it's great so you now have a framework

00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:07,210
that can do things and in fact it's so

00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:10,660
good that it uses twelve percent less

00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:13,270
resources resting and ninety four times

00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:15,580
less resources while it's going to the

00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:19,900
math on this is we have a two thousand

00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:22,990
dollar a month amazon cloud you can pay

00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:25,540
ninety dollars for the same result or

00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:27,400
continue to spend two thousand dollars

00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,900
and break it have more containers

00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,790
running which leads to more fault

00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:35,380
tolerance and more iOS and all sorts of

00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:36,820
other benefits so it's also what perfect

00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:40,540
up against all the other frameworks that

00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:42,310
have come out has this incredible I mean

00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:45,220
we've basically one in every category in

00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:46,960
terms of memory usage and and speed all

00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:49,960
sorts of things and in the popularity

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,330
has has rocketed up so high than in fact

00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,440
we crossed scholars gala I don't know to

00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,910
pronounce that I've only ever seen a

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,880
written does somebody know to pronounce

00:33:54,910 --> 00:34:00,400
que la scala Scala here's the Scala okay

00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,230
and then we're going to add in the next

00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,120
few months from across Ruby which is

00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:06,090
insane we've only been around for you

00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:09,340
know we haven't been around a year yet

00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:11,679
this is super crazy exciting there's

00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:14,649
more exciting stuff than this one

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,870
exciting thing is we met a developer who

00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:20,200
used to be the lead developer of

00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:22,750
lucasarts you know like Luca your father

00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,690
because I guess that guy who also

00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:27,460
happens to be this his last name is

00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,919
lassond you may have heard of the lassan

00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,590
School of Engineering and he was this is

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,780
genius and he gave us a half million

00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:36,280
bucks basically well 1.2 million dollars

00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,350
and then some other people through and

00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,639
some more money so we go hire people so

00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:43,419
we could go make this framework the

00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:45,550
coolest framework in history so after

00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:49,060
all of those cool things wasn't that

00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:50,679
exciting today I stand here and I can

00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:55,450
feel like a complete failure and so now

00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:56,950
I'm going to discuss that obviously we

00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:59,050
haven't completely failed and this is an

00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:01,390
ongoing story but today at an open

00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:03,670
source conference I'm like we have great

00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,960
technology and we totally failed the

00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,109
open source part

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,080
and here's why so I would actually this

00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:13,530
is my favorite quote another one of the

00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:16,119
guys in this in the Swift world he said

00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,410
the biggest problem with perfect is that

00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:20,470
in my opinion you guys are staining

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:22,599
Swift's reputation and in fact another

00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,880
way of looking at it is basically the

00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:27,820
Swift elite so Swift has been around for

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,730
one and a half years two years they hate

00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:34,869
us they hate us like we're not invited

00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:36,010
to the party so then one guy said you

00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:37,450
know someone who does not understand

00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,010
Swift should not be making a framework

00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,690
for it if you don't know how to drive a

00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:42,270
car you probably shouldn't take one on

00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:46,839
the highway you're gonna hurt someone oh

00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:48,970
right here ow we were gone for 20 years

00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:51,430
but you know we brand new too Swift

00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:53,230
there's only a year old although guys

00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,580
want to truly understand Swift and

00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,410
they're so passionate that choose to

00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,060
spend their nights and weekends what

00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:01,540
because we only worked like an hour a

00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:02,740
day I don't know why a company has no

00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,490
background in Swift products would

00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:08,859
randomly decide to create a swift server

00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,910
somebody had to endure the the only

00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:11,080
reason I can think of they wanted to

00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:13,690
take advantage of Swift's boom in

00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:21,700
popularity or abuse it it feels like a

00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:24,099
gimmick no another guy who's in the

00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:27,460
first few days who's a leading author we

00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:31,330
did an analysis of the most popular

00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:33,970
speakers in the Swift world the most

00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:36,609
popular speaker immediately said you

00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:43,270
guys are spamming us and you are not

00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:45,040
swifty and we were like what's swifty I

00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:48,150
mean it's Louisville it's only been

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,530
around for two years like not even like

00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,680
even crystallized the language looks

00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:55,390
like yet and yet we're not swifty I was

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,859
like well what is that sorry I asked

00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:59,349
like what is this and and here's like

00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:01,270
well it's just did you don't use the

00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:02,980
things that Swift has in it all right so

00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:04,839
can you give us an example they said yes

00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,240
you don't use structure each of you

00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:09,700
structure use classes okay what we have

00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:12,250
money so I took people and put them in

00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,780
and said go find every possible class

00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:16,650
you can change this truck there four

00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,650
hundred we found two

00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:23,880
okay there's another big thing that

00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:25,980
happened and that was that another small

00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,880
start-up in the States decided they were

00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:31,050
also going to come up with a swift

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,670
framework called IBM I remember the day

00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:34,230
this happened because we're like rocking

00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,700
it everything's going great and we're

00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:38,520
building stuff we're hiring people to

00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,800
make cool stuff and then out on the st.

00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,750
waves it says IBM has stepped into the

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,700
ring I got to tell you this is sort of

00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,890
like you know I feel like you're you're

00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,290
you're the 800-pound gorilla and you're

00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:52,350
super happy about that and King Kong

00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:54,540
walks in I let you I'll tell you I did I

00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:59,250
lay down the ground like this and I

00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:01,500
started to cry anyway needle to say fast

00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,580
forward a little bit and and we're you

00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,110
know we're still on the same plane

00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:07,890
ground because we're still all building

00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:09,510
technology so we're still fighting IBM I

00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:11,070
don't fighting what's interesting is now

00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,360
from an open source everyone's open

00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,710
source and ever supposed to be its first

00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,290
you know this flowers being thrown in

00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:18,090
the air and it's fun and really like

00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:22,590
we're at a conference about a month ago

00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:24,030
and in there there's all the sort of

00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:26,640
frameworks were there that have now sort

00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:27,750
of sprung up and IBM was talking about

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,520
the frameworks and how cool they were

00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:32,010
and they went from person to person

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,590
person and skipped us completely and

00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,090
went on to the next room as it were so

00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:38,100
everyone has seen the movie where the

00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:40,770
guys like what what is this what am I

00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:45,740
we're like of it am I not visible enough

00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:49,200
like another thing that we screwed up on

00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,550
was we call the project perfect right

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,980
now I want to defend this a little bit

00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:55,760
because obviously it seems egotistical

00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:59,210
they would call software project perfect

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,589
Germans hate us I will note that

00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:02,030
but actually the here's how it would

00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:05,420
happen is we went hey you know we want

00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:08,150
to paying homage to LA so soft which is

00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,609
a lamp style project we wanted to make

00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,830
sure we were in the lamp stack you know

00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:15,200
in the MS as you know represent mysql

00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:16,670
maria i was the latest one not really

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,470
that latest but same sort of idea

00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:21,050
closers project the turned open source

00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:23,480
is as you went okay we want to

00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:26,480
start the letter P obviously so we're

00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,070
going to start with P you know and we're

00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,920
we tried to come up with a name that was

00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:33,830
a bird starting with the letter P it's

00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:38,240
like pheasant partridge in all these

00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:40,040
stupid names they're all taken like

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,010
we're at a point in the universe where

00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,930
every dictionary word you can think of

00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:48,800
is a programming language or a framework

00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:51,619
by now right and the second part is it

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,810
got one at the org and so you know we're

00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:56,000
trying to buy or go get org so we can

00:39:53,810 --> 00:40:00,260
make this an iconic thousand-year-old

00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,830
project and try finding a dot org these

00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:05,150
days they're not cheap and you weren't

00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:07,070
the only ones that we could find that

00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,839
had started with a p and didn't suck

00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:11,630
completely was perfect so we just kind

00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,760
of adopted it and we've had more people

00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:16,010
hate us for the name we chose then you

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,380
would possibly believe in fact we did a

00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:19,940
survey and thirty-three percent of

00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,130
people thirty two percent of people hate

00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:24,349
it like some evil idioms that I refuse

00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:25,760
to use it because of the name which

00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:29,680
doesn't seem like a technically sound

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,970
decision but but that's that's a reality

00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,390
which also okay so that's a big mistake

00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:37,580
another huge mistake we made this year

00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:40,160
in fact next week we're being nominated

00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:42,890
and we're the top three right now for

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,180
the best brands that came out of Canada

00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,650
this year the canadian association of

00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:50,570
marketing professionals has said this

00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:53,450
brand is awesome scratches his head but

00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:55,460
actually it more came across like

00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:56,660
granted great-aunt Matilda you know

00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,180
walks in the room and she's trying to

00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,650
smooch all the developers like this sort

00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:03,440
of attitude that we were trying to come

00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:06,410
across as this a thing that wasn't the

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,250
idea but what we got was is this idea

00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:12,180
that we were suspicious marketing I'm

00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:14,430
not sure what suspicious marketing is I

00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,900
I said you know but the damage is done

00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,220
anyway because you guys have decided to

00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,680
heavily market something that's not the

00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:21,839
best it can be is anything the best it

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,760
can be you just heavily marketed

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,050
something built quickly in a small time

00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,319
frame by someone who does not have

00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:30,270
strong Swift background there's no such

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,400
thing as a developer with three years of

00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:35,400
Swift experience except maybe chris

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,260
lattner himself all right so nobody has

00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:41,339
a strong Swift background sorry I'm

00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:43,410
ranting now anyway I needed to tell

00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:46,200
somebody and you guys are forced to

00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:49,079
listen to me another big mistake we made

00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,790
and this I'm liquid I'm totally new to

00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,089
this we're totally this we'd never had a

00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:56,250
soft an open source project before and I

00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:59,369
can remember we were mapped augment

00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:02,579
licenses with Evan and Chris we were all

00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:04,800
a part of that sauce and and we like

00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:08,250
well we went to lawyers and lawyers told

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,349
us that GPL is the way to go you're like

00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,730
okay like when we did old selection

00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:13,230
lists that made sense I read every book

00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:15,420
i went to chapters about every book they

00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:18,210
had I read everything I'm like GPL seems

00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:21,089
like a logical thing I'm so we GPL did

00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:24,329
and people were like throwing us out of

00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:26,640
their boat over GPL we will never use a

00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:29,190
project that GPL they can't stand GPL

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,510
and I'm like it doesn't work in this

00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:32,099
environment instead of Terra so we were

00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:34,230
like then what do you want it to be like

00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:36,210
we're just trying to give it away we're

00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:40,920
going to make money on helping people in

00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:43,710
other ways and basically there was a

00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,230
group of people who went to the one was

00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:48,740
Chris he really has to update his

00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,740
pictures online

00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:56,330
and he said that the other one was of

00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:58,920
course Bob Young the founder of red hat

00:42:56,330 --> 00:43:01,650
who's also slightly connected the GPL

00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,560
and we talked to him and and it was like

00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:06,930
tell us what should we do and he said

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,120
it's if the licenses in the way get the

00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:11,430
hell out of the way like make it not be

00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,230
a subject for discussion so we changed

00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:15,810
it to apache and everyone stopped

00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:17,610
beating us up on that another thing that

00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:19,080
we had was this idea and we're still

00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:21,900
calling is that that people are still

00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:24,750
have this attitude that we don't accept

00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:28,500
contributions I don't know what we did

00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:30,660
wrong but like why wouldn't we accept

00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,340
contributions I don't understand that

00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,930
that's why we did it like we wanted to

00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,790
get we want to play in the open source

00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:38,100
world with you guys in your in your

00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:41,040
sandbox and we're not invited to the

00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:43,140
sandbox so what we found is honestly as

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,700
people are contributing to all the other

00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,470
projects and we're sort of working all

00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,360
by ourselves anyway in many case that's

00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:50,130
not completely true we have a huge group

00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,480
of people but we made some other

00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:54,450
mistakes along that another example

00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,340
would be and when we were like hey what

00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:58,110
what where should we be having open

00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:00,480
discussions in the community and I was

00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:02,430
like oh let's go everywhere let's start

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,600
get or let's start slack upset IRC lets

00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:04,920
our Twitter let's say let's go start

00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,850
every possible place we can have a

00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,000
conversation let's have a conversation

00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:11,130
that was a stupid idea by the way the

00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,080
future reference because in fact what

00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,700
that meant was we had a few people over

00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,870
here people over here people over here

00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,460
when somebody ask a question over here

00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:20,430
the person knew the answer was somewhere

00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:22,290
else so not actually having one place

00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:24,630
for everybody to communicate was a huge

00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:26,700
mistake on our part and also now where

00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:29,160
we're seen as less popular than some of

00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,690
the other frameworks as an example

00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,920
because we don't have as many people or

00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,780
in factory count up all the people that

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,300
are actively using it we're way ahead of

00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,710
everybody else just I think I actually

00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,030
don't know because don't know how many

00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:40,260
people are still with what they're how

00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:45,060
many people across channel it's very

00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:46,110
confusing that was a big mistake there's

00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,780
another issue that we have and that's

00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:50,460
why we're Canadian this is a bizarre

00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,230
sort of thing but people literally came

00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,180
up said well we're not sure how the laws

00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:58,310
work in Canada and whether you're open

00:44:54,180 --> 00:45:01,050
sourcing will be as open source e as us

00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:05,349
we're like what

00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:08,440
come on another issue is the idea that

00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:09,910
we are company and then we accepted you

00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,440
know investment and other things and

00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:15,730
we're very public about it okay we got

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,380
money it's so fun this is awesome and no

00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:19,660
that didn't work at all people are like

00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,570
nope corporations are evil you're a

00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,580
corporation therefore you must be evil

00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:27,010
no we're not evil or not trying to scare

00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:29,349
anybody what's funny is all of the other

00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:32,470
guys including IBM or somehow getting

00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:34,900
away with being a corporation I'm like

00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:36,730
this is that a corporation to kind of

00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:39,040
think that's a corporation so anyway I

00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:40,750
you know I sort of said look you know

00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,070
we're doing this because we're trying to

00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:43,960
create a stable place so we can create

00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:45,880
we can actually build this product and

00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,740
grow this product and and rethink this

00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,240
framework because we really believe in

00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,680
some of these cool new ideas that we've

00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,840
brought forward that we've been hiding

00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,800
under a bushel for so long and now we've

00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:58,450
been able to bring them out into the

00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:03,400
light another big mistake I've now told

00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:08,200
you my story but the number of people

00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:11,289
who said that because I wore a suit I

00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:14,020
couldn't be trusted we as a company have

00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:16,150
a CEO that's an inherently bad thing

00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:18,640
therefore you shouldn't be working with

00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:21,849
that project over there and in fact so

00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,170
are like PR team took the most relaxed

00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:26,740
picture of you which is has to be the

00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:28,089
worst picture of me in fact the PR team

00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,980
game and said you know what we'd like

00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:31,150
you to get into like an ironic t-shirt

00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,970
we'd like to take pictures of your an

00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:35,740
ironic t-shirt it's like what I am NOT

00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:37,630
going to dress in an ironic t-shirt

00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:39,880
because people believe the I any ideas

00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:41,920
so maybe that's another fail is that's

00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,349
what ever got me to where I am wearing a

00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,510
suit the only guy in a room has actually

00:46:44,349 --> 00:46:53,140
limited our ability to move forward as

00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:54,789
an open source project a whole bunch of

00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:57,069
other issues that i would say we've been

00:46:54,789 --> 00:47:00,069
accused of being anachronistic because

00:46:57,069 --> 00:47:03,400
we did things like habit org because dot

00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:05,470
ayos are cool neon orgs we used soft

00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,819
inner name perfectly soft that was

00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:08,289
actually just last minute we're supposed

00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:10,270
to be perfect ink and they're trying to

00:47:08,289 --> 00:47:11,529
be a perfect ink in Markham and so we

00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:13,150
couldn't incorporate that and was big

00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:14,859
thing but incorporate that they and it

00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:16,839
was like just call it something will

00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:18,609
inherit soft that's funny go with that

00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:22,510
perfectly soften come on that's funny

00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:23,950
right another thing was we positioned

00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:26,529
ourselves the lamp stack and of course

00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:28,599
for the micro service advocates out

00:47:26,529 --> 00:47:30,069
there that's an anachronistic idea as

00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:31,960
well I was like well that was just

00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:34,510
because there will be people who want to

00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,000
use PHP beside this so it does make

00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:38,589
sense to position ourselves there but of

00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,380
course we're not hipsters we have

00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:43,630
marketing I own a marketing company I

00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:47,170
can't help it it's like I don't know I

00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:49,059
just I mark it so I mean one possibility

00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:51,780
is that actually I i get some orange

00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:55,170
hair and a fleece vest

00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:57,150
and then I'll be good to go anyway so

00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:58,650
that's it i'm running a time I didn't

00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,960
want to sort of rat recap in a couple

00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:03,780
slides when I'm sorry I we took this 20

00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,750
year old project with with actually

00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:08,100
decent money coming in and said you know

00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:11,460
what that's not we're here about we want

00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:12,540
to go make something amazing or take

00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,700
these ideas and do something cool with

00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:16,620
it and jumped into the sort of open

00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,330
source idea thinking that flowers and

00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:20,490
babies would sing and everything was

00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:23,520
going to be great and in many cases it

00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:25,200
is and we've had an amazing experience

00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,550
in some ways and in other ways you've

00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,140
gotten the crap kicked out of us and

00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,730
it's been very uncomfortable because

00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,410
actually we don't know what we're doing

00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:33,180
when it comes to managing a community or

00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:33,930
managing an open source project even

00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:37,380
though we may know what we're doing

00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:39,030
technically and in fact the idea that we

00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,580
have no under no understanding of open

00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:43,020
source I've now realized we should have

00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,640
gotten involved in more open source

00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,710
projects first to understand how the

00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,690
communities work and how you know the

00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:50,010
politics work maybe before we did it

00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:54,210
instead of you know dragging our

00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:56,190
community in suspiciously good marketing

00:48:54,210 --> 00:49:01,380
I think I could change the company motto

00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:03,120
to suspiciously good marketing fleece

00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,910
vests and lumbersexual you go to add

00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:08,700
back to my dad's beard thing I know he

00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:11,070
did he look good in it and not over

00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,480
communicating you know we remember

00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,700
communicated we talked too much we you

00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,220
know we did some with it we may had some

00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:19,650
massive mistakes in this process so I

00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:21,930
guess my last thing would be if you are

00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:24,500
a developer I really appreciate your

00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:26,490
trying it this is our marketing here see

00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:29,370
and honestly if you've ever done

00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:31,380
anything in in the open source world and

00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:33,360
you're you're looking to be at the like

00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:35,550
the vanguard of the beginning of a

00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:37,740
project that we do plan on working with

00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:40,440
for the next thousand years and you want

00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:41,490
to come join and just help us go the

00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,650
right direction it doesn't have to be

00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:45,600
khoda can decode it can be like guys

00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,750
stop using words like we're going to

00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:50,250
kill you know I do you say that help us

00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:52,410
out on that I really appreciate it and

00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,970
and last would be please don't believe

00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:58,110
that every single person that wears a

00:49:53,970 --> 00:50:00,150
suit is evil it's not true then people

00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:02,390
may actually be evil who aren't wearing

00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:06,920
suits and they're among you

00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:10,269
Oh hiding so thank you those are far for

00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,269
presentations I really appreciate it

00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:19,099
we're out of time so no questions come

00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:22,010
find me later if you want some I think

00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:26,900
we end up like time for like a couple oh

00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:28,940
we do oh good yeah it's probably time

00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:41,480
for like a couple questions anyone have

00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:44,690
a question that was easy yes sir I was

00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:47,329
so Swift three crystallized about the

00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:51,529
month ago two months ago has been too

00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:53,269
long oh my gosh so when that happened

00:50:51,529 --> 00:50:55,160
the Swift package manager was included

00:50:53,269 --> 00:50:57,079
in that and as a result we had a massive

00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,910
architectural shift to handle that and

00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:02,660
so the project is still growing like mad

00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:05,210
we're still getting 20 30 40 get help

00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:07,640
stars a day we're still getting 200 to

00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:10,460
300 downloads a day so it's still going

00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,470
ABS I would call it when people are

00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:15,049
using it as a brand new project under

00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:17,240
year old we've got a lot of people

00:51:15,049 --> 00:51:19,220
putting contributions in we still are

00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,720
connect we saw this really confused now

00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:22,849
community and we don't know what we are

00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:27,259
and that's this very we're sort of on

00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:28,789
them sorry yeah I know we're we're all

00:51:27,259 --> 00:51:30,769
over the map on that right now but

00:51:28,789 --> 00:51:31,460
honestly everything's growing and we've

00:51:30,769 --> 00:51:33,230
actually had some really interesting

00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,910
things like that Chinese development

00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:37,039
community has picked up on perfect and

00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:38,599
is going is loving it and picked they

00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:40,700
love the name apparently perfect as

00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:43,130
opposed to people from New York who hate

00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:44,240
the name perfect so no it's been it's

00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:46,099
been very interested sort of a

00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,339
schizophrenia right now where every day

00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:48,339
is like

00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:56,180
yes sir so I'm wondering to what extent

00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:58,519
you're involved in the freedoms or

00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:00,230
software sort out reach communities or

00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:03,380
those efforts among those communities

00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:06,349
because you're early the early stories

00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:11,079
that you were telling seem to be aired

00:52:06,349 --> 00:52:16,460
run with the discussions that are around

00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:18,769
inclusivity how do we find those LPG is

00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:20,539
one of the efforts to keep feminism

00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:23,029
Winkie I mean there's all sorts of stuff

00:52:20,539 --> 00:52:25,130
out there now about this and it's all

00:52:23,029 --> 00:52:28,660
about how you know this isn't about

00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:30,859
angry young men in your parents basement

00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:34,880
which sounds like the later part of your

00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:37,309
story right it's about you know living a

00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,190
good life and we can only build good

00:52:37,309 --> 00:52:41,390
things we've done together everybody I'm

00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,190
gonna come find you after its that's

00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:45,019
okay and write down a list of places we

00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:46,519
could go because not knowing where to go

00:52:45,019 --> 00:52:48,739
like I went to chapters about every book

00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:51,140
but it's like thought that didn't have

00:52:48,739 --> 00:52:53,989
any of that in it I did go to this

00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:55,519
really cool conference today and that's

00:52:53,989 --> 00:52:58,190
that's sort of the beginning of the new

00:52:55,519 --> 00:53:03,700
chapter of the journey I would say thank

00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:03,700
you yes sir

00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:18,299
I have absolutely no idea would be the

00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,609
real answer for that if anyone has any

00:53:18,299 --> 00:53:22,829
suggestions on how i could do that we

00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:25,140
would love to hear them join our slack

00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:26,279
and actually join this lack go do these

00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,799
are the things one of things we didn't

00:53:26,279 --> 00:53:30,839
do is we got we actually closed well

00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:32,759
went to some of the channels and said

00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:34,980
look this seems to be the most popular

00:53:32,759 --> 00:53:36,539
channel let's stop having conversations

00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:40,019
over here let's start having

00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:43,039
conversations here yes sir oh sorry yeah
