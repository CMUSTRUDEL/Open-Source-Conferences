Title: FSOSS 2016: How to Completely Fail at Open-Sourcing
Publication date: 2016-11-26
Playlist: FSOSS 2016
Description: 
	Speaker: Sean Stephens, CEO with PerfectlySoft

"Open-Source your product", they said. "It will be great", they said. But what if you have never been involved with an open-source community before? In this example talk, we'll show you exactly not what to do when taking your 20-year old product open-source. How not to dress, what not to say, how not to do marketing, how not to grow a community and how to get other groups to spin off other products and leave you wondering what the heck just happened. All based on the recent experience of taking a popular server-side language with significant buzz open-sourced and gradually making every community mistake imaginable.
