Description: 
	Speaker: Anas Tawileh, Director with KPI

Predictive analytics is the application of machine learning, statistical modelling and artificial intelligence to the prediction of future events (what will customers buy next, who will citizens vote for in elections, and what product will appeal to which users). With the explosive growth of data and the accelerating adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), many organisations are looking at predictive analytics as a source of competitive advantage to capitalize on these new data and deliver compelling user experiences. In this presentation, we will introduce OpenCPU, the open source solution for the deployment of predictive analytics. We will discuss OpenCPU's features and capabilities, learn how OpenCPU can be used to integrate predictive models in web and mobile applications, and explore some examples applications that can be used right away from OpenCPU's app directory. We conclude by looking into the future developments and adoption of OpenCPU.
