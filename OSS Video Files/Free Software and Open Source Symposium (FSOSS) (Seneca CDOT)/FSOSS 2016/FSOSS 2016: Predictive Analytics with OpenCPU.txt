Title: FSOSS 2016: Predictive Analytics with OpenCPU
Publication date: 2016-11-25
Playlist: FSOSS 2016
Description: 
	Speaker: Anas Tawileh, Director with KPI

Predictive analytics is the application of machine learning, statistical modelling and artificial intelligence to the prediction of future events (what will customers buy next, who will citizens vote for in elections, and what product will appeal to which users). With the explosive growth of data and the accelerating adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), many organisations are looking at predictive analytics as a source of competitive advantage to capitalize on these new data and deliver compelling user experiences. In this presentation, we will introduce OpenCPU, the open source solution for the deployment of predictive analytics. We will discuss OpenCPU's features and capabilities, learn how OpenCPU can be used to integrate predictive models in web and mobile applications, and explore some examples applications that can be used right away from OpenCPU's app directory. We conclude by looking into the future developments and adoption of OpenCPU.

before we start I'd like to ask about

00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,860
poor people in Brisbane intelligence

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:20,800
predictive analytics who knows obviously

00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,800
you

00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,890
but I can't promise that you will be in

00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,410
this short session with some basic

00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:33,180
knowledge of obesity that you can put it

00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:39,090
to work right away but before we start

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,090
let's talk a little bit about modalities

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,510
so

00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,900
this is actually a true story target the

00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:52,720
start of it in succeeding Canada have a

00:00:49,900 --> 00:01:02,370
story marketing where's Ashley from use

00:00:52,720 --> 00:01:02,370
of when the extent of the teenage girl

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:09,190
pregnancy program the girl's father

00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,930
opened the package of all they're

00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:14,770
disappointed that he went to them and

00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:17,140
they say my daughter is not pregnant

00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:21,330
they sense we say about our system state

00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:26,229
she is so they basically use their

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:28,060
loyalty program they checked purchasing

00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:30,400
habits and what start with I think she's

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,270
buying and they concluded that most

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,430
probably this girl is pregnant now there

00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:39,610
is detail in the field whether this is

00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:42,340
actually a true story or not like

00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:45,670
targets a citizen Stewart's of a saver

00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:52,060
was more like a media homes but at least

00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:55,229
it shows the power of predictability so

00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,229
what do we

00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:07,570
but we go there a person who knows who

00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:12,910
won the highest prize in jeopardy the TV

00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:22,630
shows system what I am Martin actually

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:24,430
won the prize and Watson is the perfect

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:28,080
example of political analytics because

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:30,700
what it does is actually it was fed

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,410
structure masterful information from

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,750
many many sources including the web

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,720
though during the show it was estimated

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:40,110
tremendous so it has to rely on the

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,580
information and data that we have and

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:47,470
whether there the question a question

00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:49,660
was asked so jeopardy sorry Watson had

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,549
to go through all this possible answer

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,190
to this question use predictive

00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:56,980
analytics techniques to figure out which

00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:00,580
is the best match and basically raised

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:03,790
its hand and give the answer and it won

00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,380
against the two champions of the program

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,650
who would who made the most money and

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,430
succeed like a worm a successful in

00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,430
history of the program

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:57,700
so this is communication research to

00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,760
communicate in such that basically us

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,620
using our computing knowledge our

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,410
programming knowledge our data base

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,530
knowledge look into existing data and

00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:11,250
try to find trends and explain what

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:18,669
happened so that's what we mean by

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:22,150
analytics by liquid analytics the key is

00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:24,220
that we use techniques like predictive

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:28,450
modeling machine learning and data

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:31,810
mining what lies caramel historic trends

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:34,840
and he is to make predictions about the

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,360
future so if we go back the story of

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,270
target that's actually target looking at

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,330
their point of sale data and customer

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:47,650
data realizing that whole this year is

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:53,210
most part we pray or Watson

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:55,400
structured data warehouse and say this

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,400
is the most likely answer to this

00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,760
specific question okay so we predict the

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,470
key above is that we are putting into

00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,280
the future we're trying to expect things

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:10,400
that may happen in the future in

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,160
business politics point patterns from

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,180
the historical transactional data but in

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:21,800
this kind of business opportunities I

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:24,340
assure you that each of you have used in

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,639
one way or another during this morning

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,900
go check the weather

00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,660
that's route to the head of things so

00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,400
they actually use weather modeling to

00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,710
predict what will happen will it rain

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,910
when it's be sorry whatever it is who

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:43,130
use Google Maps to find anyway today

00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:45,169
Google Matthews analytics to say all

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,900
that program is going to be busy to us

00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:50,600
throughout this faster that's better so

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,240
so we basically use it every single time

00:05:50,600 --> 00:06:09,080
and must like me more than once every

00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:12,800
single day so explain what happened to

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,840
the tech is trying to and into the

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:21,050
future and predict what will happen in

00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:24,950
the future is good for for observing

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:27,639
trends what this is good for making

00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:31,419
decisions about how we add

00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,189
every possible future events it's really

00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:35,110
important to understand the difference

00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:38,020
because people use the terms

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,810
interchangeably and they are not okay

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:44,259
and it's of any piece of software or

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:47,610
website last week that you see that has

00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,610
reporting capabilities

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,979
okay sometimes they are told

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,319
business intelligence but you can

00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:58,750
actually change the views of the tables

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,090
of the resource you get or how many that

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:04,960
is traffic is displayed on how the

00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:07,780
graphs explain but the key here is that

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,389
only reporting on what happened they are

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:13,389
not moving into the future and the key

00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:16,780
the Frenchie is between looking at what

00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:19,419
happened and projecting to the future is

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:22,810
using predictive models mathematical

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:25,090
models about that could explain what

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,819
might happen of course they are not

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:31,360
perfect no one can exactly maybe what

00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:36,340
will happen tomorrow but as our reliance

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,620
on weather forecasts traffic routing we

00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:44,229
have pretty good confidence in these

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:46,779
models and other differentiates that it

00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:48,580
is actually use the past use fact things

00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:51,279
that actually happened I can be hundred

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,039
percent sure that it was raining

00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,229
yesterday but I cannot the other person

00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:58,960
through that friend more I can get the

00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:06,250
perception so that's the key

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:09,630
we between what Gartner the something

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:16,229
firm put together a very nice and scale

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:19,090
of analytics country so they start from

00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:21,699
descriptive analytics which actually

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:24,009
help you explain what happened in the

00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:27,699
past what development has happened in

00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:30,220
the past and then yeah most economics

00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:32,950
that go beyond describing the events and

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:39,669
trying to explain why these nets

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:43,690
happened to do about our subject this

00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:47,610
flow is what will happen in the future

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:52,570
and there's some emerging to you

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:55,630
competing you w all that prescriptive

00:08:52,570 --> 00:09:01,779
analytics that's telling how can we make

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:04,450
this future half so over the years we

00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:13,080
moved from looking at the data that were

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:15,240
collecting then I'm looking at this data

00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,320
I think enticing in different ways

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:22,769
through uncovered trends and understand

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,209
why did this these events happen they

00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:26,220
we're looking we're using our

00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:29,640
understanding and the technologies that

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:33,510
we have to predict what will happen in

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:36,300
the future and I just thought we speak

00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:40,290
there are many smart people or

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:48,660
information that will help us create the

00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:54,839
desired future events using you see the

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:57,450
stealthy increasing from bases to

00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:03,300
structuring it in a way that that

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:07,190
exposes trends in the future to actually

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:17,160
working on creating create in the future

00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:19,920
so this thing isn't actually new but it

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,680
was easy here because it's basically

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,140
Queen Elizabeth's you just put the base

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,120
and say give me how much money is

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,430
Pacific customers spent over these three

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,270
months that's simple what what happened

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,830
in the world yeah no that is actually a

00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:37,770
creating the date time coming

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,990
nice organizing it to see you know can't

00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,690
explain what happened that the

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:45,690
principles are there and everything's

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:48,450
just like we have weather forecast for

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:51,330
many many years now it actually depends

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:55,170
on mathematical models some of them are

00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:57,150
very simple linear regression some of

00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:02,070
them are very very complex like the ones

00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:04,070
used by blossom but the key here is why

00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:07,350
are we here in particular and things

00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:10,470
more and more in the media and research

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:13,340
and in silence because now we have two

00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:17,310
things first of all we have enough data

00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:20,100
this for big data thing we can actually

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,700
help train our bodies but a scale model

00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,310
so that that outcome makes sense

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:30,180
seriously we have enough processing

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:32,490
power and through reading power to

00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,700
process all of these data with huge

00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:38,490
amounts of data and use it to train our

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:43,010
models then our mothers make sense and

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:46,010
that's why not we will see more and more

00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,010
towards

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:56,360
so as I told you the easiest example of

00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:58,459
the phonetics of being around us for

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,860
many years is the weather forecast

00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:03,620
it tells us will happen today tonight

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,189
Saturday some neighbor within days into

00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,230
the future

00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:11,360
based on mathematical waterworks

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,790
so sometimes we use the third model on

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:18,129
TV when they say our models show us this

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,129
will happen is what will happen okay

00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:29,389
traffic routes same thing whenever you

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:33,970
see them say easy or that when you reach

00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:37,089
them okay and that's also based on

00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:40,629
mathematical modeling and predictions

00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:43,279
this is this is very interesting because

00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:46,569
this morning I was actually trying to

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,990
book my life to the Web Summit in Lisbon

00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:53,329
next week

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:56,889
and perhaps a advice watch so I clicked

00:12:53,329 --> 00:13:01,759
on this and they say prices will 94

00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:04,850
within 7 days our moment strong

00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:09,379
indicates that Fairfield will fall

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:12,610
during an examination this forecast is

00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:15,930
based on analysis of historical price

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:21,009
another guarantee of future results

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:23,589
but that's amazing it's actually a very

00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:26,139
smart innovative application of liquid

00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:29,050
analytics calf normal because they have

00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:32,079
all this data of the bookings and prices

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:34,269
and changes for the past 10 20 years and

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:38,800
they can know that for this specific

00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:40,120
trip the price will most likely and you

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,120
see they have trends you can actually

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,670
explore and it's really cool and that's

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:51,940
what actually led me to this hold open

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:53,730
CPU and so what we wanted to do is to

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,100
have this this is happening we've done

00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,110
because it relates to my contract the

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:03,579
threat that are actually booking right

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:08,889
now okay so what happened is somehow

00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:11,490
gaya sent this trip information to some

00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:16,089
mathematical prediction was it somewhere

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:19,480
got that vice and showed it to me okay

00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:21,790
in a very nice easy to use part of their

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,360
website within the publication and

00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:29,319
that's what so I will talk to you now

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,630
about a very nice open source tool for

00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:36,930
big the paralytics and how we can use

00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:40,980
our CPU to expose these capabilities as

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,980
well in web applications

00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:48,020
also a very famous application is the

00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,570
personalization and recommendations do

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,150
you get in sites like Netflix like

00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,550
Amazon when you buy books because these

00:14:53,150 --> 00:15:00,530
not all so addictive element exponents

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:04,960
so they analyze you profile and they and

00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:07,700
they suggest movies based on your own

00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,830
many many parameters but including your

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,870
demographics what you like what you

00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,750
friends by what people like you like

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:18,680
what people who like this him also like

00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:21,410
movies kinds of things and the inner

00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:25,940
story of the Netflix contest that

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:28,490
happened three years ago so let's say we

00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:32,840
want like our key key for us to succeed

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:35,540
is personalized and give residents and

00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,790
reliable recommendations for our viewers

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,130
right the more element these things are

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:42,650
then what I will stick with Netflix and

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:44,570
not go to their competitors so they

00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:47,720
think it's something quite innovative

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:51,350
they say okay what we will do is we will

00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:55,550
put all of our recommendation data on

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:58,430
the web and ask for people to contribute

00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:02,050
with improvements of our recommendation

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,699
algorithm and anyone actually

00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,459
Oh succeeded in proving the

00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:11,350
recommendations by 10% we can the

00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:12,819
million dollars so they wanted a car

00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:18,489
there's a very nice website called

00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:23,019
goggle agdlp dot-com so it specializes

00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:25,389
in machine learning analytics context

00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:27,579
they put the daytime there is still

00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:30,610
available if you want to see it and it

00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:33,309
opened the competition and teams started

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:38,199
to fall all over the world trying to

00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:40,720
meet next races on algorithm and the one

00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:44,139
the team that won were actually two guys

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,239
from Austria who would have no idea what

00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:48,579
analytics / machine learning was and

00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:51,489
they were asked me seriously they were

00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:55,119
learning and they I think develops

00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:57,309
through in the contest which is it makes

00:16:55,119 --> 00:17:00,569
sense because sometimes what you need is

00:16:57,309 --> 00:17:03,970
this fresh external outside perspective

00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:06,159
to uncover something there are something

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,449
that those who are so focused on the

00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:09,449
system couldn't see

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:19,059
so that brings us to open source

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:24,910
analytics there's a fantastic project

00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:28,830
code our that's open source more than 50

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:32,140
useful it's basically a mystical

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,970
analysis package so it's thought are I'm

00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,210
to get all of these kinds of things you

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:41,380
know mean standard deviation the

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:43,600
rhythmic regression all guys you think

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:46,900
of and before they treat all the mature

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,059
so it has developed a very nice

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:52,530
ecosystem around so so many people

00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:55,540
actually contribute my games library

00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:59,080
almost everything you want in statistics

00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:03,520
and math is that very very hard and our

00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:06,340
story is when we're building them one of

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:11,500
the zoo of our solutions so we needed to

00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:13,809
predict for physical stores how much the

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:17,730
customer would spend what what is life

00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:17,730
time to put that customer lifetime value

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:25,390
for each customer and how can you

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,270
predict what we call the churn risk

00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:30,580
which means how lucky it is that this

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,070
specific customer we walked away and

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:36,300
never come back for whatever reason that

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:40,080
customer service high prices but

00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:42,510
addition one derivative will set us to

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,070
use our because we we want to use open

00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,070
source technology mobile to go through

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:53,760
and ideas pretty simple so you need to

00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:56,880
get some historic thing about whatever

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,680
you want to recommendation you want to

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,350
predict customer lifetime value you want

00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:06,480
to predict from just show you want to

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:14,420
actually predict students results you're

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:14,420
in historic data this data evaluation

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:28,650
can help you around our community so

00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,990
every time you get the moment you

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,690
training with the training data that you

00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:36,450
Decatur's for training you tested with

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:40,260
an estimator if the outcomes make sense

00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:44,580
so it means that the model you created

00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:47,490
has good prediction power so can predict

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:50,190
with like 80% accuracy 90% accuracy

00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:53,210
until you're satisfied you said I can

00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:57,990
invade any person I can live with not 5%

00:19:53,210 --> 00:20:02,700
so at some point the output of your

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:04,770
world is this predictive model okay that

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,200
we tested evaluates that you sure that

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,530
it makes sense and provide value to

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,810
customers I'm sure that exactly what

00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:16,840
tactic when they make this book

00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:19,330
for pricing this is okay wait because

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,330
price will likely go down so they have

00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:24,040
some kind of score of how likely the

00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:28,210
price will go up or down or stay the

00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:31,000
same and we get these models and it's

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:35,890
nice you can you can use them on our and

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:40,030
I say everyone but then the problem

00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:43,810
becomes how can I expose this predictive

00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:46,420
functionality to the web if I want to

00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:48,940
use this and exactly the same way like

00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:52,990
ad didn't when I was studying for my

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:57,130
ticket so how can I use that same our

00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:59,860
model that I have confidence in through

00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:06,820
the web interface and as besides me

00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:09,400
we're open CPU kicks in so in kind of a

00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,680
larger system but for our purpose let's

00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,850
just focus on its relationship to our

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:21,690
because that's that the beautiful part

00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:25,020
so it use the HTTP API to expose our

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:27,000
spreads functions and ones

00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:30,780
which means that I have my mother and

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,720
having these predictions now I can put

00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:39,960
it behind open CPU and I communicate

00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:42,090
with open CPU ms VPN behind okay so open

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,940
CPU will back that request excuted in

00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:47,450
our and the temple is also back to me in

00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,450
real time

00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:55,969
so I can also use it for our some very

00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:58,609
sophisticated graphics capability

00:21:55,969 --> 00:22:01,249
showing very sophisticated graphs and

00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:03,589
analytics you can use it because it's

00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:06,709
open CPU also I'll show you some

00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:09,229
examples now to embed these graphs in

00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:10,699
websites in web applications or even any

00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:20,089
other application that can communicate

00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:23,299
through our API okay speaks HTTP can

00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:26,089
told our functions through open CPU

00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:28,729
without without needing to know what art

00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:31,449
is without having to go too deep you

00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:37,359
know implementation details for

00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:42,199
understanding their syntax for the our

00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:44,979
system and our CPU will provide all the

00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:48,169
management of requests load balancing -

00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:55,149
insecurity credentialing all of that

00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:55,149
will happen through open CPU interface

00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:05,120
so in the end but why did I get exposure

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:09,870
of my religious modern capabilities

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:12,540
through an open web basic API which will

00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:19,320
help me to build scalable production

00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:23,160
quality software and since its Spencer

00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:27,150
HTTP I can certainly use gas controlled

00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:36,240
SS and load balancing anything with HTTP

00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:39,870
okay so it does all of that through what

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:45,180
they call open cpu apps and obviously

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:48,180
you are is actually a small package that

00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:51,750
contains you a script with some

00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:54,840
additional like what you want simple web

00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:58,730
resources so that they expose these

00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,730
functionalities to the world

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,910
and there's a library called offense CPU

00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:11,770
no js' that will enable you to really

00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,510
build your application very quickly so

00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:16,540
you have you remove it and I will show

00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:18,760
you now the structure of a complete open

00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:21,250
CPU are you have the artwork that you

00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:25,180
build a script and then you can just

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:27,250
open G of X if you go Jas to embed these

00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:31,630
features functionalities in your web

00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:36,430
page that you want to interact with it

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:40,120
depends on jQuery the not required but

00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:42,430
very easy and convenient these so how do

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,350
I actually make use of obviously B how

00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:47,430
can I use it there are two

00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:50,940
implementations what we call standalone

00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:54,430
secret the server it doesn't have the

00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:57,340
sophisticated caching credentials

00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:59,500
security management it's you can

00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:02,830
actually use it for testing purposes

00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:06,370
development environments the other

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:08,680
version is the cloud server which has in

00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:12,130
the production ready release actually

00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:18,330
and if you point is you will do for

00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:18,330
people to 0 or PI so

00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:25,950
are we happy with the components of the

00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:29,130
open CPU applications okay so we have a

00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,929
car model because our script that I can

00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:33,510
usually communicate with through our

00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,289
studio and I want to take this and put

00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:37,440
it on the web

00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:42,210
July and inoculate using Jason and this

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:45,750
behavior okay I know that actually it's

00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:49,110
very very straightforward to install it

00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:51,780
on a fresh you want to setup very easy

00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:53,250
but I was afraid that it might not work

00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,100
so I set it up already

00:25:53,250 --> 00:26:01,740
we'll get to it now but it's really we

00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:08,580
just go to open CPU you just update get

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:10,930
and then you install OpenCV that's so I

00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:14,190
can actually go

00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:14,190
all of this year

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,650
so this is actually our instance on

00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:38,350
this is our instance on on AWS and as

00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:42,090
you can see throughout exporter you can

00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,090
choose the wizard you have get post

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,720
so and that's the end point now web

00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,240
services in point I want to communicate

00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:57,060
with so I can actually this one is

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,760
telling here show me what they were out

00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:05,810
in the library get request to the

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,810
library so I say Ajax will show me now

00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:12,810
has recovered okay so just to turn that

00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:15,650
valid is to be response and it's showing

00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:18,180
me all the libraries that I can access

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:21,380
these are part of a standard

00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:26,760
installation so can see everything

00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:29,520
graphics markdown matrix

00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,730
those are cool stuff so let's go back to

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,730
this

00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:41,940
very basic stuff how can I stop I can

00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:48,390
start top of HCP US service we start

00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:51,540
like any other service the other part we

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:54,090
hate that production builder this cloud

00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,340
chamber has caching capabilities and

00:27:54,090 --> 00:28:00,540
it's really important I cannot stress

00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:04,980
this enough because predictors handling

00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:06,750
smaller are complex and they take a long

00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,910
time you will see now when we send some

00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:11,730
requests to the server they take a few

00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:13,380
seconds sometimes even a couple of

00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:16,020
minutes three minutes depending on the

00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:18,870
complexity so by editing the caching

00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:21,180
server for open CPU every time I am

00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:22,710
sending the exact same request it

00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:25,020
doesn't have to be processed for

00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:27,990
operating you wish improvement in

00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:32,180
performance so so I always recommend

00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:32,180
doing there

00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:44,230
okay now comes the fun part

00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:46,630
and exactly like arms developed an

00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:49,360
ecosystem of libraries and applications

00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:53,980
and scripts of a CPU is also developing

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:57,460
still not huge like other open source

00:28:53,980 --> 00:29:01,350
projects but it is history so there are

00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:03,010
some libraries and programs to come just

00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:07,450
installed ready

00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:10,030
so to export the tools very easy we can

00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:12,760
just say I want together from github in

00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:15,730
the library on github I can say in stone

00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:18,600
enough it's that one of the libraries

00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:21,600
available and these that may often CPU

00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,600
probably

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:32,920
so it's like you would say or so that

00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:36,290
usually that interactive are also

00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:38,660
usually that's where I send the data for

00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:40,790
my predictive models and forgive me back

00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,380
the results when I hit my module and I

00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:45,260
do the training and I do the best thing

00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:51,650
I use this interactive platform on

00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:55,240
Windows you can use something called art

00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:57,380
studio which else you expect ninety e4r

00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,580
but when you finish you package your

00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:05,320
solution and in particular so I have is

00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,320
doping let's just try me

00:30:10,489 --> 00:30:16,369
just a nautical attempt under their food

00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,369
library think I was in school

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,930
to fund it

00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:48,760
so I installed it already just because I

00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,760
didn't want

00:30:52,820 --> 00:31:00,610
so I can now go to my senses so let me

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,610
first

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:07,500
so you want to show me if I say so

00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:13,280
myself NCP for CPU I will get this

00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:13,280
Explorer option okay so if I say library

00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:21,530
and the library is actually a package of

00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:25,880
different scripts or tool that you can

00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:29,450
use it on so it should give us the same

00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,800
one that we saw when we sent

00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:33,550
you know

00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,550
they

00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:43,180
so that the information on the gate

00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:47,050
starts package it's a distance

00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:53,080
application reasoning both information

00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:53,080
let's now go to the web

00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:59,359
for good stuff

00:31:55,909 --> 00:32:03,049
so remote a bit now we actually went to

00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:07,699
the user provisioning would their github

00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:10,999
profile and showed me all of their

00:32:07,699 --> 00:32:15,769
contributions and stars so all of these

00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:20,799
graphs are built using up a easiest way

00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:24,739
to embed sophisticated advanced graphics

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:27,349
in in a webpage of everything is just

00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:30,949
normal web requests anyone who is a

00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:43,329
contributor to github the other github

00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:46,329
repo anyone I'm sorry there we go ahead

00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:46,329
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:55,570
in this you yeah so what happened now

00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:59,200
our favor that we just started together

00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:02,500
we'll get up with your username because

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,210
all of you commit pork stars and

00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:08,350
everything I'm not sure if it's

00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:11,760
interactive let's see what you can do

00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,760
actually you can make it interactive

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,900
also as PDF see

00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:35,180
so how did you

00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,180
benefit network

00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,960
so I purchased a little bit of Xavier

00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:50,789
installed and our library so anything

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,789
that that we installed on the our

00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:56,789
installation all of a CPU would

00:33:53,789 --> 00:34:03,210
immediately be accessible through the

00:33:56,789 --> 00:34:06,780
oven CPU web interface okay so we start

00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:09,359
from source code you just get get the

00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:13,500
battery whatever it is and and we just

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:16,230
exploded or my preferred way of doing it

00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,929
is to have an active oxygen like the one

00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:21,800
I did right now what I said libraries on

00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:25,169
so or in school and so I would just

00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,450
there's another one so this one is

00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:30,300
called eSport so it's actually a

00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:32,940
predictive analytics model that predicts

00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:36,960
how many hours people with an average

00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,060
watch TV based on their age and marital

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,629
status

00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:44,820
okay so it's another CPU contribution so

00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:48,590
it's available on github so let's let's

00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,590
book the github page of that project

00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:09,450
so this is the project for eSport for

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,570
open CPU and as you can see we have the

00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:16,190
our stuff that's the moment that you

00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:24,690
build okay this is the data that we use

00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:27,450
but that's how

00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:32,700
so I actually installed them on this I

00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:38,670
can just go to here and I say open CPU

00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:48,030
library biggest or ww2 here it is now

00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:52,049
showing a graph this is the average

00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:55,730
hours of TV per day and different colors

00:35:52,049 --> 00:36:00,690
are for married widowed divorced so on

00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:06,650
so that's fine but it gets nicer when I

00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:06,650
actually start asking it give me

00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:17,640
actual prediction so I will connect to

00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:25,690
so they'll have a JSON object that says

00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:29,590
I have three individuals 26 years old

00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:34,270
married 41 divorce 953 never back okay

00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:39,010
so I can just send this JSON object to

00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:41,970
the Web API endpoint for TV score and

00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,970
you will see now

00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,960
for

00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:16,110
so that was it so it predicted how many

00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,680
hours of TV each of these individually

00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,170
watch

00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,570
so when 60 Roma spent two point nine

00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:25,550
five what when he wrote two point six

00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:25,550
one three point

00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:32,300
so so now oh that's so simple and

00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:34,010
straightforward you can read this data

00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:37,400
and plug it into any web application

00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:39,380
that you're using and really unlock the

00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:43,550
power of whatever predictive model that

00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:47,950
you build so another one that I actually

00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:52,790
wanted to show you this there is a basic

00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:55,100
functioning heart that says is called

00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:57,260
are normal which means just give me

00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:00,530
normal numbers generate normal numbers

00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:04,520
okay so I can very simply go to that

00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:07,760
endpoint and say give me two normal

00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:10,930
numbers sorry random numbers give but I

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,930
can also stay

00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:20,400
a lot of the deviation

00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,800
five

00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:35,310
so these are five bad news random values

00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:40,740
where their meat is then and the

00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:42,810
standard deviation is poor do can you

00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:45,599
see how this can be useful for you

00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:49,530
just imagine any mathematical function

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,829
you can think of you can be easy ask

00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:54,450
through an interface but for me this was

00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:56,040
that was a very important turning point

00:38:54,450 --> 00:39:00,000
in our application because now we can

00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,740
not only do like batch processing and an

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,380
update that I couldn't the database or

00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:09,619
nightly basis we can actually show it to

00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,619
the user in real time it's much easier

00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:23,860
okay so now just a couple of slides that

00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:27,310
will help you if you want I can share

00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:28,210
these with you if you want to use it

00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:30,070
give it a try

00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:33,510
so it's actually there how how do you

00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:36,670
configure the server dolphin CPU server

00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:39,450
if you want to back what packages you

00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,950
want to preload or performance

00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:44,880
what's the size of the file because

00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:48,670
sometimes you create some J large files

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,970
let's say graphs you have some big graph

00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:56,380
of student performance over the years or

00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:57,940
whatever so if these become become very

00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,280
difficult to send through the web

00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:03,310
interface in the browser so usually what

00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:06,880
happens are created by in a temporary

00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:11,340
folder and you access that file and you

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,340
get that information from from that

00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:18,090
maxi's before these two gigabytes

00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:21,550
because someone has a very simple like

00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:23,680
Meg progression or in these are easy but

00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:27,250
some others are very complex so for

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:31,200
example the mother at Boston use in

00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:31,200
tourism wide variety of

00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:38,880
so it said exact same request to each of

00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:42,220
these models and that calculates a boat

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,109
like how many waters came up with this

00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,690
is all business and maybe to the best

00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:53,200
one that's a very big performance issue

00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:53,880
so that's why we say try to give it

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,270
enough

00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:01,510
like memory give it the sufficient data

00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:04,119
ambitious for the request and use

00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:06,690
caching caching is really important in

00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:06,690
these cases

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,660
this tripod okay so

00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:22,190
so thank you very much this is normal I

00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:25,990
have I hope it was helpful and examining

00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,990
these people

00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:39,309
another world they're all source code

00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:41,740
their only source so they use the our

00:41:39,309 --> 00:41:46,059
language so they could have a script I

00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:49,019
will show you the one for for the DV

00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:49,019
score everybody

00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:58,830
so these others if I actually have this

00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:05,630
so it

00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:08,690
that's easy

00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:09,650
that outcome is actually very simple and

00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:12,200
straightforward

00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:15,980
the difficulty is finding the right

00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:18,829
model for your problem and to do so the

00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,180
way you have to do it is first to stop

00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:22,430
to start by organizing your data

00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:25,400
properly and splitting it usually we do

00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:28,759
70% of the data we have as training and

00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,880
50% has best and then trying every

00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:35,630
single motive you can be go some models

00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:38,740
are more suitable for specific problems

00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:41,569
like predicting for example

00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:45,109
possibilities like will this patient

00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:49,630
have cancer or not the binding of others

00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:55,210
are better for scale predictions like

00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:55,210
average age of males in Toronto

00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,380
it depends but you need one of these

00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:02,470
over time it's it's really fun by

00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:04,180
working with our buddy Spanish in Sweden

00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:07,539
medicine people and all of these are

00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:08,920
available I can actually go and show you

00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:12,339
a little bit of the star that you can

00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,529
stay with so as we go the example that

00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:18,279
he suspects us opens if you don't worry

00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:27,220
so you have stuff about stops it starts

00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:30,900
with this pivot so you can just check it

00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,900
in what they have set up

00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,270
yeah

00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:42,509
so all of these are available with our

00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:42,509
script language very very here

00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:47,250
what

00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:04,100
you would know because okay so first of

00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,200
all we didn't implement any

00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:09,350
authentication of offensive you just

00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:11,300
focus implicitly on demonstration that's

00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:13,370
cool you can actually have a tenth

00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,240
occasion with cookie if you have a

00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:17,480
passport

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,160
you know right a puppet key you have all

00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,620
of these functions number one number two

00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,990
I don't think don't think of this but I

00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:27,260
don't think you can actually on the

00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:28,760
opposite view server through the goal

00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:32,120
you have here because it's been

00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:37,280
contained so what is expecting is some

00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:39,830
very specific stuff and it's contained

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,410
I'm not sure I haven't got that far but

00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:46,690
I think expecting our scripts a very

00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:50,310
specific way of putting the webpage that

00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:53,870
is playing so but I'm not sure

00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:53,870
we're injecting this

00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,550
this thing is

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,990
or testing to create tomorrow

00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:12,960
an article by grounding magical party

00:45:10,049 --> 00:45:16,079
techniques kind of

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:21,730
yes I think it's going to be very

00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:24,539
important and for us in the college fund

00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:28,350
as part of the because

00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:30,810
I think we should seriously Mooseport

00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:34,140
because the hardest job for the next

00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:36,900
five years two things sector is innocent

00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:38,250
and the scientist is someone who

00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,070
understands the Mystics

00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:46,380
and can actually dance through these

00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:49,650
kinds of motives and but absolutely

00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:52,230
respect is very important that just the

00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:54,710
fact understand what the meaning of

00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:54,710
accuracy

00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:09,550
and then the other question I have is

00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:15,550
now you give it the legs after that see

00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:16,930
that you get these people PDX so what

00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:21,140
I'm thinking is that's it that was a

00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:24,500
business that was we need some

00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:27,349
this economic decision is on the part of

00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:30,460
prediction was I mean if the model

00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:30,460
itself is not

00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:37,200
then for example is a that seemed unfair

00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:42,350
he showed officials of the places we

00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,350
thought that'd be not necessary

00:46:46,539 --> 00:47:19,849
yes if I find if I listen to gaius

00:47:16,819 --> 00:47:27,640
recommendation 500 everyone they get it

00:47:19,849 --> 00:47:34,369
wrong so they wouldn't be going mother

00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:38,140
unless they actually do Stan listen to

00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:38,140
it once or twice experts

00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:49,800
so that in the end it's not an exact

00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:52,980
like 100% science is our consignment and

00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:57,119
that respects together so you need to

00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:59,550
really be happy with probabilities of 70

00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,820
80 90 percent of the direction being

00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,820
worth

00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:09,390
that's where actually the whole work in

00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:11,280
Africa mixes is actually tuning and

00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:13,890
fine-tuning and training to the mother

00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,290
of the game in the game so that and

00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:18,720
that's why it's really fantastic to you

00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:20,760
you guys have probably some sometimes

00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:36,780
you're still studying she Joseph

00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:42,809
cattleman you see the different ways of

00:48:36,780 --> 00:49:01,069
solving the problem but most importantly

00:48:42,809 --> 00:49:01,069
they have donated performance

00:49:49,200 --> 00:50:08,250
competitions are very nice the

00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:08,250
divination that three things reach back

00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:13,450
that's an otherwise of course so yeah

00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,670
training

00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:32,060
and the other stuff

00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,850
brother

00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,890
yet

00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:57,860
are

00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:57,860
actually one eye

00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:05,750
where that occurs

00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:12,470
and if you go if you're looking for a

00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:14,450
workshop just think of the difference it

00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:17,510
means when you said I want this on

00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:19,820
camera even like templates whatever it's

00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:23,140
like for me this means you work with

00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:26,600
real data and you created 3d models

00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:29,000
that's exactly what I want so this is

00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:32,000
this is a place where people should

00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,190
really spend time with and it's also fun

00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:40,780
we can play with the news and you see

00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:40,780
what people are means okay so

00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,330
