	00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:11,160
what does it mean to be a lifelong

00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:13,750
learner it means you never stop and

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,240
there's two parts of learning there's

00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:18,640
learning my ways that you know how to

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,830
learn you know the reliable methods that

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,470
you can use for learning and then

00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,509
there's things that are really really

00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:28,240
difficult to try to learn so for example

00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:30,669
I came into VSD I have no programming

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,220
background at all I struggle with it

00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:35,789
every single day I work at it but I work

00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:39,190
at two things practicing and i work at

00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:42,070
learning how to learn it better okay

00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,989
this is you know for anybody coming into

00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,570
the program that don't they don't have

00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:47,980
any programming background it's it's

00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,719
horrendous let me just put it to you

00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,180
that way although there's a few people

00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:58,719
that just pick it up like this easiest

00:00:52,180 --> 00:01:03,850
breathing so what what it feels like to

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:09,159
be a student that constantly learns how

00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:11,500
to learn i'll show you admit sometimes

00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,170
how I feel and I know a lot of other

00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,330
students feel before I got to high

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:20,409
school I think I high school was the

00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:22,390
tenth time I moved schools when I was in

00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:24,400
elementary school so I moved around the

00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,079
lines and then in my career I've lived

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,460
and I think nine different cities in

00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:34,720
Canada in 18 years of a regular force

00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:37,119
military career during that time in the

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,869
military I was always on courses if it

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,399
wasn't in a class it was online there

00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:44,829
was always plenty opportunity to work

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,259
then on top of that I was working full

00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:49,329
time within a child with special needs

00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:50,200
in the heart condition and I was still

00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:53,259
doing an MD

00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,590
part time that's what New Year's food

00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:59,920
but I got true but what I was finding is

00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,570
that it was really really difficult to

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,750
do it than NBA has a variety of

00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:07,060
different subjects and not any of the

00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,670
subjects are similar maybe accounting

00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,940
and finance but you got to use different

00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:17,010
techniques to learn that subject matter

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,720
not one-size-fits-all from running so I

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,239
started to do a ton of research on

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,160
better ways to learn and I came across

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,220
two things but we're going to talk about

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,220
these in depth in these two things are

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,620
really what led to the creation of the

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:36,190
Glivec study notes which by the way is

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,980
not available yet i'm shooting for me

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,319
january that it should be available to

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,380
the public i'm close but i'm not close

00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:46,709
enough aight so i'm going to show you

00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,709
this

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,080
okay two things about that video show

00:02:52,550 --> 00:03:02,720
that again because I think it kind of

00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:05,330
hard started about 15 feet per second he

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:11,570
doesn't have anything for them he has no

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:14,030
ammunition he has nothing yeah so two

00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:17,300
things about that sometimes I tell I

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:22,250
feel a little learning and either ground

00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:23,690
represents a test and that's also the

00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:28,220
thing that really ended my military

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:30,530
career I had a mad parachute landing in

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:34,160
2001 when 13 years ago being diagnosed

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:36,310
and as when it was finally diagnosed I

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,600
needed surgery on my hip in my back was

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:43,310
ruined so I liked the video because it

00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:50,930
motivates me to be here and I don't have

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:53,750
to do that ok this is prezi by the way I

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,140
love it but I'm just getting comfortable

00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,760
with it I think it's a great software so

00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,010
i've done this i put it all finally

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,570
together yesterday and there might be a

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,459
little a few bumps in it but i'll get

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,459
through so things are going to talk

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:09,010
about is the memory palace this is one

00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:11,810
of the techniques that I employed

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,510
extremely heavily when I was doing my

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:18,919
MBA especially marketing marketing was

00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:21,019
an 800-page textbook 16 chapters and the

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:24,860
exam was three hours long and everything

00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:27,710
is you can they can ask any question out

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,860
of that textbook so 800 pages of text I

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:34,640
had to digest so from memory palace will

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,120
do one who knows what one is no that's

00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,790
criminal

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,490
homes okay go they talked about it in

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,110
shows like that mentalist all that kind

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,889
of stuff but I use these things like

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,720
crazy we're going to do it here's the

00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:53,250
rules to a memory palace you pick a

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,560
location that you know for you creep you

00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,820
can create one in Minecraft or you can

00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,940
just come out and do a floor plan of

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,740
your own but think of this I want you to

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:05,100
think about this i call it the bathroom

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,780
effect i come to your house I say can I

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,940
use your washroom and you say yep down

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,530
the hall first one on the right do you

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,789
think I'm ever going to need to get

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,820
instructions on how to find that

00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:17,789
bathroom again probably not you just

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:21,539
know the human brain just knows it knows

00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:23,460
about spaces and locations it's very

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:28,560
good at this the human brain didn't

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:32,340
evolve to there's there's no text in our

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,310
evolution okay spaces are hunting

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,100
gathering there's no texting this is

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:41,220
part of the reason why this works second

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:44,160
rule pick a path we're going to go into

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,800
my little tiny memory Alice here you

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,110
pick the path you stick to it so what

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,160
that means is basically come in follow

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:55,590
the perimeter of a location hey don't go

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,419
from for example the basement up to the

00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,240
third floor of the building down to the

00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,370
washroom on the second floor into the

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,380
front door yet pick a path pick the

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:08,039
perimeter usually works best and stick

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:10,979
to it third thing is the more bizarre

00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,900
you can develop imagery of what you're

00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:16,139
trying to remember in your head the more

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:19,020
sticky and the more bizarre it is the

00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:22,199
more sticky it is in your repo we're

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:25,080
going to do one of these really quick so

00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,289
here's my fictional floor plan forget

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,649
it's got no bathroom

00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:31,719
stairs are always a but this is what it

00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:37,509
is it's a mean entry the dining room

00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:39,699
kitchen bedroom venue living room ok I'm

00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:42,490
going to ask you guys to remember a

00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:45,369
series of six words and then I want you

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,559
to see if you can remember what the word

00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:51,490
there now keep in mind the average

00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:53,860
recall rate on this is about five most

00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,569
people can do fine your pretty good if

00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:00,399
you can do seven your exceptional if you

00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:02,139
can do nine just rote memory okay but in

00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,369
this particular case we're going to do

00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,300
this and then we're going to walk

00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:10,020
through it with the with some imagery

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:12,550
okay we're going to go to the first room

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,469
remember this word i'll give you a few

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,469
seconds okay

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,660
good wine

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,990
okay any volunteers

00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:55,169
to use watch tolko

00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:57,780
yeah you're pretty you're on you're on

00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:00,030
par with a pretty decent healthy memory

00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:05,969
for the average person but if I to bump

00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:08,009
that up to 12 or 15 or 30 it'd be a lot

00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:10,919
more difficult the point of this is not

00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:14,389
to make you master memory palace it's

00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,389
just to show you how the technique was

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,490
bizarre right

00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,149
how many of you five medium coffee

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:56,430
one milk

00:08:48,829 --> 00:09:01,160
is my favorite okay what was more sticky

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:04,160
in your mind the text or the imagery

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,160
okay

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:13,770
this is a really interesting thing I

00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:15,540
came across in the summer we're going to

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,220
have a couple of guesses here so the

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,310
question is what percentage do we start

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,100
to forget new information we've learned

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:25,620
for 20 minutes after 24 hours no

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,230
researching this the results vary but I

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:32,970
picked the one I'd like to get suited my

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:35,640
groceries oh so take a guess who wants

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,470
to guess to show them one percent in the

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,399
first 20 minutes after a class that we

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:46,190
start to forget interesting whiz it will

00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,190
put you two in 42 wolf

00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:53,470
4222 is in the answer how about 24 hours

00:09:53,770 --> 00:10:04,610
sorry simile le sentier it's actually 54

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,620
okay so here's what it looks like you

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:10,580
got it immediately you got a hundred

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:13,160
percent after 20 minutes you still have

00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:16,610
fifty percent of rain but you forgot the

00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,520
rest after a day you still have what

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:25,060
thirty-three percent in your head 60

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:25,060
seconds gone how do we improve that

00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:33,150
what's a way to improve it it's simple

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:36,960
you just do review but there are

00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:40,430
specific intervals their frequencies of

00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:43,080
review that are the most optimal okay

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,460
and all I spend a lot of time on this I

00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:50,520
don't want to scare you with it right

00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:53,070
that may be some year I'll leave that

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,140
alone okay but one of the things that we

00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,790
can do with our software and we're going

00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,410
to we haven't implemented it but this

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:02,100
will be one of the pieces that we put

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:03,720
into it will get will I'll show you the

00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,570
software in a bit but we're going to get

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,010
into an automated part of this number of

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,280
mind your for students that are using

00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,280
the software

00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:18,500
okay this is the second piece this is

00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:22,150
the second big piece that I came across

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:27,110
in my research on learning how to wear

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:31,250
verbs nouns adjectives and adverbs do we

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:35,660
need anything else the answer to that is

00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:37,580
most definitely maybe I don't know for

00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,650
sure that we need every single word but

00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,080
you know my experience has been no I

00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:43,250
don't need every single word and we're

00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,380
going to go through something and I'll

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:50,740
show you why so this is a long passages

00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:54,410
161 works and i will read it to you okay

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,510
the years 1912 the day is april tense

00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,550
the titanic set sail from England the

00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,410
ship has three football fields long 11

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,810
stories high and it's the largest moving

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:05,090
object ever built the ship has elegant

00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:07,550
restaurants a swimming pool in indoor

00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:10,100
gardens some of the world's richest

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,450
people stroll through its fine rooms no

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,090
one seeing it at this moment would

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:17,030
believe the tragedy lies ahead it is the

00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:19,280
ship's first voyage this floating palace

00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,840
is bound for New York City the crew

00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,270
intends to set a record getting there

00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,000
the Titanic is the most powerful ship on

00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:27,920
the sea for accents builder there is

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,320
nothing to fear let other ships crews

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,440
worry about iceberg warnings other ship

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,570
sank the Titanic the Titanic is unique

00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:38,870
sadly pride goes before the fall around

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:40,940
midnight on April 14th 1912 a massive

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:44,150
iceberg ripped open the mighty ships

00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:48,980
steal all tons of water gushing for the

00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:52,579
Titanic the end has come 161 words

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:56,769
do we need all the non nouns verbs

00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:56,769
adjectives and adverbs and need all that

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:05,769
somebody tell me the elegant noun that i

00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:11,420
mentioned that wasn't in there anyone

00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:14,899
fine sorry fine nope the hints the key

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:18,529
word there was the word elegant little

00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:23,680
best shot that's what

00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:28,630
how high is the tiger okay

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:34,540
a lot of computer people here right good

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:37,240
with numbers so let's look at this 1912

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:40,180
1912 april twenty Titanic set sail from

00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,890
england three football fields long 11

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,350
stories high largest moving object ever

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:47,230
built as elegant restaurants swimming

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:50,100
pool indoor garden some world's richest

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,750
people stroll through tragedy lies ahead

00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,180
chips first voyage bound for New York

00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:58,209
City crew intends to set record getting

00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:02,830
their most powerful ship on sea around

00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:05,230
midnight April 14 1912 massive iceberg

00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:09,750
rips open ship steal home tons of water

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:13,649
gushing and has come 79 words okay

00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:16,839
what's important about those 79 words is

00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:19,450
that 82 of the words in that passage

00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:23,980
were meaningless we didn't need them

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:27,750
okay the remaining 79 words hold a

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,750
hundred percent of that entire passage

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,440
now it's verbs adjectives and adverbs

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,970
now there's a couple of our words in

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,510
there you know I'm not going to get into

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:39,550
the grammar police but there are a

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,190
couple of words that still do relief we

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,780
do need them one word this place here

00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,940
there could actually throw out the

00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,220
meaning of the entire sentence so it's

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,620
important to be clear that you know it's

00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,480
not a it's not a law of nature that only

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,940
the nouns verbs adjectives matters help

00:14:52,480 --> 00:15:00,040
her heart people looking any there are a

00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:03,240
couple of Hulk awards in them okay put

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:08,110
the rest in this passage 51% they held

00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:11,110
0% of the meeting 0 so this / that is

00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:13,840
that it is that it is the lettuce yep

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:16,150
Batman and I could have gone and done a

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,910
whole entire passage but you get the

00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,320
point that's even hard for me to read so

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,730
it's just an extraction of the words

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,730
that we didn't need just to highlight

00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:30,970
okay so i used a lot of different

00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:34,540
softwares i'm working with with a

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:38,340
company out in Elberta we've been

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:41,050
collaborating on this for months now and

00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:44,709
do you guys know LS some of you may know

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:47,360
illness she teaches in bsd probably

00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:49,519
for a lot of the work that she has done

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,040
in the past with her career she worked

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,579
with text she's actually the one who put

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,800
me onto the Stanford University parts of

00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:59,600
speech agar which POS and i don't mean

00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:04,660
the other POS Darrell thinking right now

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,660
fun tail with a good but not that one

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,730
it's a very important component of the

00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:13,579
software of what we're trying to do and

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:15,980
the speech Tiger is completely open

00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:17,779
source free from Stanford University no

00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,149
I do think there is a commercial license

00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:22,279
component to it but I haven't really dug

00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:23,930
too deep into that piece yet but

00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:27,680
everything else that I'm doing here

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:31,399
everything on this software is all open

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,680
source off everything but a massive

00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:37,190
component of this is the speech tag and

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,140
you're going to see that why it

00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:44,180
so what I'm doing is I'm basically

00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:46,280
trying to combine a couple of big

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,260
techniques that are going to help with

00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:53,450
recall of massive amounts of information

00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:57,050
I want to point out one thing this is

00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:59,450
really good for theory this is good for

00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,190
history it is good for biology but I'm

00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:03,860
not going to be putting computer syntax

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:08,329
a penis okay this isn't going to help me

00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:10,670
write computer code it's not going to

00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:12,470
help me do calculus but it's going to

00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,810
help me understand the theory it's going

00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:18,770
to help me link one idea to another idea

00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:20,630
a concept to a concept and if you don't

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:24,890
believe me I'll show you in a bit but I

00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:27,230
just have my c++ midterm exam last week

00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:30,220
we can have to go I use this for a lot

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:30,220
of the definition work

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,920
so the goal like i said is to link a

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,490
concept to another concept but do it

00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:43,390
graphically in a way that your brain

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,390
evolved to remember things

00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:50,270
really get to the fun

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:54,060
so this going to be difficult to see I

00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:55,620
think if I do this it might help a

00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,740
little bit i didn't realize that it was

00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:03,360
going to be difficult so we've got the

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:07,050
Titanic I've already pre-loaded this in

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,050
the interest of saving time because my

00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:13,830
my amount of time is somewhat limited

00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:18,810
but I've run this through the software

00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:20,520
already the top piece is the this piece

00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:24,620
here is the original note above the

00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,850
Titanic the revised piece down below is

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:30,180
exactly what it is in a run back through

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:33,180
the part of speech tagger and what that

00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:36,330
did is it highlighted all the nouns

00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,160
verbs adjectives and adverbs you'll see

00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,360
you know it does that in a second but

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,150
i'm not going to go through the process

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,100
because i don't have time to do it but

00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,920
what I've done is I've taken the relies

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,470
notes and I've created my graphic image

00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,650
of the entire story there's a couple of

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,540
text boxes in there there's a few words

00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:58,710
basically the entire almost the entire

00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:01,790
thing is a graphic image and so what i

00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:05,610
can do is i can go into this editor and

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:07,470
if you look over to i guess the right

00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:08,450
hand side of your your screen

00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,700
I don't know if you can see the mouse

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:15,210
but it's over here where I'm kind of

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,100
clicking true and what that's done is

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,980
I've built the presentation I've taken

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,870
the text I've gone through the the

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,150
speech tiger and now what I'm doing is

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:28,080
I'm actually going to create this thing

00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:31,530
graphically so want to take a couple of

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:35,000
examples here my picture is incomplete

00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,000
and I did that on purpose

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,559
no if I can

00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:48,570
okay so what we do here is I'm missing

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,830
some things and what I can deal with the

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,900
software i don't know if you can see you

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,360
at the back but i'm basically grabbing

00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,070
the words that have been isolated so all

00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,860
these colored words over on this side

00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:03,660
they're all nouns and verbs adjectives

00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:06,990
or adverbs you notice you need to shut

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:09,810
that up you can see here some of the

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:13,890
words that are not visible I can't drag

00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:15,750
those over those are the non parts of

00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,780
speech things that I'm interested in but

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:21,090
everything else that remains is from the

00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:23,280
words that were summarized and really

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,290
quickly what I get to do now is take

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,270
those and I want to build megalithic and

00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,430
appalling anaglyphic it's a higher above

00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:32,520
so think of this entire thing is telling

00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:36,360
a story through a pirate book so what i

00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:40,770
can do is bring that over i can do it

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:44,340
that way and just search for the image

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:48,410
that I want and drop it in now I can

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,410
resize it anyway

00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:56,870
ok

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:59,740
I can put text in that I'm actually

00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,740
going to do it this one

00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:12,350
I'm looking for bizarre or unusual type

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:17,270
of clip art from which I can build a

00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:20,330
graphic story okay here's a there's a

00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:22,670
limitation of doing this if I look at

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:26,750
new york city and i try to drag in new

00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:28,670
york city and create an image of that or

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:34,300
any of those pictures really all that

00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:34,300
memorable no but if i do this

00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:46,989
I do this

00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:59,240
what's more memorable the text of NYC

00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,040
how am I going to recall that later or

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,110
what's what's better that I take my

00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,780
long-term memory that's attached to the

00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:07,790
Statue of Liberty liberty and I use it

00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:11,309
to tag information to short-term memory

00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:16,399
and recall that okay

00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:16,399
um what's missing from here

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:30,360
11 a date first sorry the size of the

00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,789
building so if I say what's a good

00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:39,889
representation of 11 in my mind you know

00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:39,889
what it is okay

00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,760
21 with two looks and with that

00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,000
and that represents to me

00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:58,460
that's easier for my life to recall than

00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:01,039
just a statistical number when I'm

00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,480
recalling this information later boy

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:07,039
that's what I'm going to remember to

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:10,340
represent 11 okay so i can go through

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,980
and build all sorts of different things

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:15,499
here but i can tell you from a lot of

00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,720
experience doing a memory palace or

00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:20,840
using imagery to try to recall

00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,659
information this is a lot more sticky

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,169
for me in my mind and recalling

00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:30,550
information than just looking at this

00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:34,000
this text over here

00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:37,420
notice something else this relates one

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,880
concept to another this relates over

00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:42,820
here you see the Union Jack that

00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:45,220
represents England what's better to say

00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:47,890
it's you know visually in my mind the

00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:50,290
word England or the Union Jack once a

00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:52,750
representation but notice I've drawn an

00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:54,820
arrow from the Union Jack to the Statue

00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,550
of Liberty it's an idea that is

00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:01,060
connecting one eye one idea to another

00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:03,220
idea okay now there's another piece that

00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:12,490
we're looking at over here to this is

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:14,800
the same this is where I get to take

00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:17,020
other notes from a different chapter a

00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,940
different subject and later on I'll be

00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:20,670
able to do a summary and what I'll do is

00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:24,370
I'll just drag and drop from that note

00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:26,440
that idea and I'll connect them

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:29,920
or I'll connect them from one idea to

00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:33,970
another so I can take it a sub topic

00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,980
from a I don't know dynamic arrays to 2d

00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:38,200
arrays and I can create the theoretical

00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,270
limit of what it is I want to remember

00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,990
and then I can join the two ideas

00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:47,740
together okay very similar to the idea

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:50,140
of memory or my max right people employ

00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,030
mind maps quite a bit but this is a

00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:58,720
graphical representation instead of

00:24:52,030 --> 00:25:00,130
words of my mouth so I can do that and i

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,059
can connect them both arrows and

00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,059
different ideas

00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:13,290
I can do things like that so what I want

00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:16,070
to do is kind of get out of here and I

00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:16,070
want to go back to

00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:27,900
talk about the future of this

00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:31,080
to me the way education seems to be

00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,270
going is virtual reality I know medical

00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,640
schools are doing it right now

00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:38,220
engineering schools are doing it boeing

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,620
i think is training their mechanics with

00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:44,070
virtual reality they're getting rid of

00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:46,590
the text based learning just looking at

00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:47,970
your textbook there's a lot of value in

00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:50,340
that there's a lot of learning that does

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,290
go on that but what you're seeing Rick

00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:55,440
addicts that are working on a big giant

00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:57,060
going engine or actually putting on 3d

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,010
goggles or halt the lens and they're

00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,840
getting to pull the engine apart without

00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:03,360
having a I don't know a million-dollar

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:07,050
lock up of an engine right there they

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,700
can do it electronically so to me when I

00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:14,130
look at this and I look at the

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:17,580
environment that we're in this here is

00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:20,070
minecraft with all the lights my son

00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,710
loves minecraft all I use this technique

00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,600
of my son by the way just so you know we

00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:27,060
learned five definitions for some

00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,370
science class that he had in about 15

00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:34,050
minutes word for word just using imagery

00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:36,510
no words at all this here is an

00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:39,060
environment that was you know obviously

00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:41,760
created let's say I take my virtual

00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:46,470
reality I make my califica and then I

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:48,890
start placing it around maybe no

00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:51,750
are just examples of here this is Mars I

00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:53,549
I can immerse myself in an environment

00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:57,299
with the information that I'm trying to

00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:59,940
remember maybe with lithic study notes I

00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:03,090
create my cliffs I put on hollow lens

00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:05,280
and I walk around the school and I start

00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,870
to superimpose all my images in all the

00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:12,000
different rooms that I know the

00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:14,010
classroom maybe I put some image of the

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,110
Titanic up on the wall in the library

00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:18,650
and as I'm walking around with all the

00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:21,450
lens on I'm actually reviewing my test I

00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:25,440
could sit down and crank it out the hard

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:29,940
way and just sit there for I can review

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,710
the Glivec then recall the Glivec then I

00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:36,419
can start employing techniques of the

00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:38,010
memory or the forgetting curve one of

00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:40,820
the things we want to do long term is

00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:43,049
employed virtual reality with a game

00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,120
there's a component in here where you

00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:46,799
build your own quiz you're asking

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,100
questions based on the notes that you

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:53,520
are creating you also put in the answers

00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,440
but if I can employ a game sort of

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,010
environment for this and maybe a virtual

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,539
reality or augmented reality and traders

00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,669
are you a video game I think my

00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:07,650
ten-year-old would rather play a video

00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:11,520
game and tell me he studying vs prank in

00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:15,090
an error with the old textbook David ok

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,130
so the future of this for me really a

00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:21,539
virtual analogy but I want to be very

00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:23,910
very careful of the idea of making it so

00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:25,800
only rich children rich

00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,870
these people that have enough money to

00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,330
support them I want to find a workaround

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:34,350
they wanted to be exclusive behind

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:36,000
people that can afford it so if I can't

00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:38,400
make it for all that I'm not going to

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,340
make it just for the select few the

00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,310
reason I put this picture in here just

00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:46,050
wanted to give you a note on unix one I

00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:48,210
took the unix class last year and I was

00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:50,100
studying for my exams I'm from Niagara

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:53,550
Falls I know that city like the back of

00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:55,470
my hand I went on Google Earth and I

00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,600
took screenshots of specific

00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:00,630
neighborhoods that have boundaries and

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,210
then I put all my unix commands on top

00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:05,160
of my friends house I put it on my

00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:07,710
school and I went to elementary my I

00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:11,840
school I can tell you that my house is

00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:14,580
LS minus D my neighbor is LS minus 8 I

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,350
can tell you what it is that my in the

00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,890
in the football field in my high school

00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:22,650
in the hospital where i was born in and

00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:26,160
when i try to recall what those commands

00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:28,740
are that's where on joint i'm going to

00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,780
my memory palace this is an example of

00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,330
it I don't need to just physically have

00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:35,280
a place that I know though I can have a

00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:37,770
virtual environment or I can have a real

00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:41,910
environment and I can use a city as my

00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:44,250
palace okay but the big thing is do I

00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,870
need all the words no do I need the

00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:48,030
nouns into verbs adjectives adverbs

00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:51,150
absolutely I do they contain all the

00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:54,090
beam do I need to see it in text no my

00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:56,400
brain doesn't like that my brain likes

00:29:54,090 --> 00:30:00,950
imagery and my brain likes to tag

00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,950
imagery to a spatial location

00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:11,929
here's just a quick and dirty example of

00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:13,979
your grocery list I didn't make this hi

00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:16,399
maybe tonight I'm going to have a number

00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,399
seven

00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:28,050
here's an example we go back to our

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,160
original floor plan we've made our study

00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,160
help you arglist

00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:41,510
so in left England on the tenth of April

00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:44,150
was heading from New York City it's

00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:47,270
three football fields long it's 11

00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:50,720
stories high rich people like the walk

00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:52,520
the halls or go for a stroll it's got

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,640
dining rooms indoor swimming pools

00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:58,340
indoor gardens on the fourteenth of

00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:01,850
April and hit an iceberg like you guys

00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:05,270
didn't know that it never made it to New

00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:08,090
York City okay i could put more in there

00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:17,180
but i think that gets the idea and i'm

00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:20,260
putting it in one of my locations for

00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,260
three football fields long

00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:28,710
11 okay

00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:38,860
hidden away from contemporary and it was

00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,860
going chair in the ark city

00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,900
google

00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:57,220
you can forget that free

00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:15,299
that's that

00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:18,390
I think it is good for something like

00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:20,880
history or maybe filed here something

00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:22,799
where you have concrete but somewhat

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,390
abstract concepts but what about a

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,190
language course if you're learning a

00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:27,690
second language would say you have

00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,789
French in high school how it does

00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:33,779
something like the supply you know what

00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:35,610
memory athletes are there's actually in

00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:38,429
the world and in the US and ultra europe

00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:40,409
there's memory championships and what's

00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:42,630
funny is a lot of those memory athletes

00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:46,380
that compete they all employee memory

00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:48,120
palaces the funny part is they all all

00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,640
of them at one point in their in their

00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,970
training as a memory athlete study

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:57,270
languages and many of them will study

00:32:53,970 --> 00:33:00,539
languages using memory palaces so that's

00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:02,700
a two-part answer for you and I tried it

00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:07,140
it's a little bit difficult but it's

00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:09,149
doable I don't know so much right now

00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:11,460
that this version is English only right

00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:13,529
maybe at some point it expands to other

00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:17,330
languages I don't know but what I can

00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:20,730
tell you is that my wife is she's French

00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:25,070
emigrated from France so real French not

00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:27,510
the watered-down stuff right now I know

00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,519
her sister came and I put it on the

00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,859
computer to test

00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:33,469
I was looking for specific things and

00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:36,259
what she said when she was taking words

00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:37,929
and dragging them into the other was

00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:40,820
that she didn't know what that word was

00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:42,109
so as somebody who's English as a Second

00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:45,229
Language and you don't know what the

00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:47,119
word is there's a good chance you can go

00:33:45,229 --> 00:33:49,639
in there and sort of get a context of

00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:51,469
what that word is by converting the word

00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:54,320
into a graphic image it's not going to

00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:59,119
work every time not every time because

00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:01,729
as an example compiler is a good work

00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:05,570
I'm not getting a very representative

00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:10,579
word of compiler from a graphical image

00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:12,829
but sometimes it does work you can but I

00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:15,349
find the whole technique for four

00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:17,899
languages languages very fast it's

00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:19,669
extremely fluid right one of those

00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:21,260
things that you just need you need a lot

00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:23,240
of crimes but if you're trying to study

00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,190
rules believe me I've tried to learn

00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,919
French of in my whole career is on

00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,929
French courses I really struggled with

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:33,200
it but learning the rules I could do

00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:35,990
that easily I could learn the I'm not

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,470
learning the syntax of language as well

00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:42,829
I guess I am unlearning I can learn the

00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:44,839
rules on how to conjugate something with

00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:47,549
this

00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:51,499
but if you look at programming let me

00:34:47,549 --> 00:34:51,499
show you this

00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,550
no I

00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,210
you see that

00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:23,470
that's a danger dynamic the dynamic duo

00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:23,470
memory each growth of a 2d array

00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:34,770
let me see if I can find another I don't

00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,770
know if I

00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:48,010
this is inheritance

00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:50,250
part of it anyway all notes on edit

00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:50,250
delete

00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:59,250
to me this represents a definition

00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:02,640
and here's a key thing to really take

00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:07,140
away from this technique I can't make a

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,720
glyph acknowl- Vita and have her have

00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,690
the same recall she has to build her own

00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,430
note in her notes even on the Titanic

00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,140
anybody we're not all going to get the

00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,910
same note but it's going to stick in

00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,950
your mind you would have to be the one

00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:22,170
to build it you can't share the note

00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:24,839
otherwise it's the same as just studying

00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:27,359
somebody's textbook you build it it

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,770
sticks in your mind you select the

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:33,240
volleyball with Tom Hanks in it okay

00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:37,470
that's what makes it sticky the more

00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,940
bizarre okay it's a roundabout way to

00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:41,880
answer your question I went off on a

00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:44,430
much like real complicated no but it

00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,460
it's the thing is I can study theory I

00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:50,280
can take a concept and represent the

00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:53,070
concept and then and that's what people

00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,750
do that's what I think hyper learners do

00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:57,150
is that they take a concept they already

00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:01,880
know it's in their long-term memory for

00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:05,070
example if i'm studying arteries or

00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:08,190
veins or something like that maybe

00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:11,130
what's my analogy the highway system 400

00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:14,010
series highway what you do is you always

00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,690
superb tamale to always a lot of really

00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,570
good students they hyper or they

00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:20,380
superimpose a new idea they're trying to

00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,359
learn on an old

00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,430
in their long-term memory and they look

00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:26,950
for the similarities and that's how they

00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:29,200
understand the concept and then you want

00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:32,410
to link back to another idea so you've

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,410
got a highway system right that you're

00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:39,730
going to link to orders what passes

00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:41,950
through it drugs or blood you're taking

00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:44,109
concepts in linking the two to get a

00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:47,170
deeper understanding that's what I'm

00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:49,569
trying to do here is I'm finding a way

00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:51,279
to recall it I'm trying to filter up the

00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:53,920
information the noise that I don't need

00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:56,920
and stick to the facts stick to the

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,970
nouns stick to the verbs put those

00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,540
together okay

00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:05,050
is there another question

00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:08,380
you know while I was working out at all

00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:11,650
this technique I was thinking maybe one

00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:14,350
for reasons why it works because you are

00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:16,150
much more involved in creating memory

00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:19,930
while you doing it like when you are

00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:22,870
right well we are like writing notes

00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:25,180
you're just clapping information so we

00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:27,390
are not making decisions but when you

00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:31,150
are creating believe you are like

00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:34,240
choosing the proper pictures selecting

00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:37,540
words right so it it also much more

00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,570
brain in the process may be one very

00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:43,270
satisfied it's all more effective so

00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:45,760
like in the person listening when you

00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:50,140
when you listen only the area of your

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:52,330
brain responsible for 12 listening if it

00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:55,150
is working when you're writing you are

00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:58,090
also using your like motor memory with

00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:01,120
more areas of bread yeah and enlisted

00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:05,140
Nick you're using much more like

00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:07,870
resources of cooperate so kind of to

00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:10,740
remember something you need to involve

00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:16,480
as much part of your brain as possible

00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:19,900
the earlier versions of this I've been

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,070
working on the project for about 33

00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,350
years now

00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:27,090
development work for putting sort of the

00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:29,740
ideas together for about three years

00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:31,990
I've talked to companies I've talked to

00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:35,860
people like I put a lot of time into

00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:38,680
this and the reason is because for me

00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:41,380
it's something that works when I was

00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,630
studying to do my last exam from my MBA

00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:46,660
the marketing book like I said was 16

00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:48,760
chapters off so at the time what I did

00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:51,850
is I went back to the old analogue way

00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,440
up with a business and I worked in

00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,630
engineering so I went upstairs and I

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,700
said look I know these 16 buildings on

00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:01,150
the base in Kingston I want the floor

00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:05,650
plans to all 16 so I got 16 big floor

00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:09,700
plans and actually I got 17 because i

00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:11,650
needed a table of contents i got 16 of

00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,990
these floor plans and i went room to

00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:17,050
room to room to room and i wrote all my

00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:20,140
notes inside those rooms that's where I

00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:22,420
wrote them so at the time a very analog

00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:24,280
way of doing it and I wasn't doing it

00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,500
graphically I was doing it's still text

00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,770
based but relying on the memory palace

00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,870
Park which was ok what was in major

00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:32,839
so-and-so's office what was in Colonel

00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:36,529
stones with all

00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:38,509
so that's how I was able to traverse the

00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:40,430
information now part of the memory

00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:42,769
palace one of the rules is pick a path

00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:48,609
and stick to it is because what if I

00:40:42,769 --> 00:40:51,680
want to go back so if i say to start at

00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:53,569
start a telescope in our memory palace

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,630
and go completely in the reverse order

00:40:53,569 --> 00:40:59,119
you're able to do it because visually

00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:01,609
you know where it is and you pick the

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,910
path if i just said go in the front of

00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:07,069
the entrance go to the bedroom to for

00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,690
the living room down to the kitchen and

00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:13,069
back you be all over the place you be

00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:15,109
lost so you basically create locations

00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:17,119
there's a part of this when you're

00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:20,660
building your note it asks you for a

00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,369
location you can reuse their locations

00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:25,339
over and over and you can build

00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:28,609
locations over them you can design you

00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:30,680
can go in and build your own environment

00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:35,050
I guess in my draft or something else

00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:36,550
are you Sketchup or Auto cabbage if

00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:39,280
but you can create your own 3d

00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:43,150
environment okay but it's the same as

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:45,760
the bathroom effect you always know once

00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:47,620
you've been there once maybe with a

00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,300
review in about 20 minutes and you got a

00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:54,760
weak bladder so what I've done is this

00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,830
is the case where I'm just taking ideas

00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:00,520
that other people had and I'm trying to

00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:02,080
streamline it down as much as I can the

00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:06,730
next version of this i did in a

00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:10,540
microsoft access database using access

00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:12,280
using this other tool that i had i got

00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:16,330
with it i worked with the company and

00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:19,660
then powerpoint so i made all of my my

00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:22,630
graphic images in powerpoint and then i

00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:25,270
linked those two walks toward my access

00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:27,640
database but the steps like to do one

00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:32,250
simple note was about 15 to 20 minutes

00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:35,050
long so they the workflow was just

00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:37,360
prohibitive to continue to make the

00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:39,940
notes in that fashion it worked once I

00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:41,210
did but I didn't want to spend 15 or 20

00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,870
minutes

00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:48,830
note when I had you know 15 notes that I

00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:51,730
needed to do this streamlines this is

00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:54,470
all about dragging and dropping and

00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:58,180
editing an image in a way that suits my

00:42:54,470 --> 00:43:01,340
needs in a way that's I'm able to recall

00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:03,380
so I always try to tag as I put a box

00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,630
around it and I tag it and I give it a

00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:09,850
location and the end result is going to

00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:11,930
be I will have several different glyphs

00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:13,790
labeled with the box around them and

00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:18,470
then I'll do a summary page in that

00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:20,810
summary will be the final in the editor

00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:23,000
and I will drag and drop all of them and

00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,590
I will fill the floor plan and then I'll

00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,810
be able to walk through that floor plan

00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:32,830
and that's my review for my test ok so

00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:36,440
you should try it if you're skeptical

00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:39,380
give it a try I don't say try my thing

00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,390
but go home or whatever try to remember

00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:43,580
I something can convert every down

00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:45,050
verb into a graphic image conceived she

00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,300
remember you don't even have to weight

00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:50,210
it down you can do it in your head

00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:51,980
that's what memory athletes do okay

00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:54,740
memory athletes will all tell you

00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:57,680
they're not unusual people Josh for he

00:43:54,740 --> 00:44:00,680
was a u.s. memory championship he was at

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,720
the he was a writer he went to the he

00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,480
covered it as a story the u.s. memory

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:08,990
championship somebody dared him to enter

00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,820
in next year's the enter key one okay

00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:12,320
the funny thing is that night he went

00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:15,020
out for dinner with a bunch of people to

00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,580
celebrate and then he went home notice

00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:22,010
that his car was missing from his

00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:25,940
driveway he forgot that he drove there

00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:28,100
not unusual people and some people are

00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:31,610
auditory some people are visual some

00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:34,900
people are tactile but all of us have a

00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:37,700
spatial awareness about it we've all

00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,920
evolved under conditions of survival to

00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:42,830
look for food that's why we're really

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,990
good with with spaces men are really

00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:47,090
good with north south east west women

00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:50,780
will say no it's down there past the

00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:52,590
logger by the fire extinguisher thing

00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:54,210
and then just go

00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:57,800
there's slight differences but

00:44:54,210 --> 00:45:03,120
ultimately we're all really good with

00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:04,530
spaces and what's inside those based now

00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,610
I know that next time you go to

00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:07,500
someone's house you're going to be

00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:10,950
looking for the bathroom which I know

00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:15,470
where this is just a nap any more

00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:19,440
questions here let's say vailable for

00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:21,540
consumption it's going to be I was

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,470
hoping that we'd be close to the to the

00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:27,750
end but some new ideas things that we

00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:30,810
want to implement the forgetting curve

00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:34,560
we want to use a bit of an algorithm to

00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:36,819
prompt the user when it's optimal time

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,890
to to do a review

00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:42,260
me personally I know I'm not going to

00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:44,690
get to the video game part another gamer

00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:48,109
but I recognize the importance of it

00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:49,550
even me I can't I can't say that I would

00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:51,829
rather be running around doing a video

00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:55,760
game with VR goggles and sitting down

00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:58,059
and just bang at it over the tent I'm

00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:02,270
hoping by the beginning of next semester

00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:06,170
I'm hoping I'm close I just got to stop

00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:11,920
adding stuff to it but version 1 is I'm

00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:14,960
really hoping it'll be available by the

00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,670
beginning of next semester and that

00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,869
version to version 3 I don't know

00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:24,650
version 2 will involve some sort of

00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:27,260
video game walkthrough thing and at some

00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:32,079
point the VR or augmented reality I hope

00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:32,079
I think that is the ultimate in

00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:43,060
I love her

00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:47,290
sorry how many people are going

00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:49,780
I have a huge list of people that I have

00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:52,030
lined up but I'm not at the point the

00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:54,790
problem is if I start getting people

00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:56,680
testing it out and then I go make

00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:59,440
updates to the site I end up deleting

00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:03,220
all their stuff and that said that tends

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:06,610
to be a huge dissatisfied so I have a

00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:10,120
huge range of people from elementary to

00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:13,090
high school college including my sister

00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:15,790
she's a nurse in school right now just

00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:16,760
waiting for the chance to get involved

00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,710
in intestine

00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,910
I will be attested I won't release it to

00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:24,680
the public without I'm trying to break

00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:26,360
in person I hope that answers your

00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,100
question I don't have them testing you

00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:41,480
right now because I'm not ready for to

00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:45,200
do it questions will will connect today

00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:50,710
again die what's your bid on the Flash

00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,710
Gordon software sorry when you flush for

00:47:52,030 --> 00:48:00,110
often it's text-based it's good if you

00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:03,530
want to know flash-based it helps you

00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:07,240
with the forgetting curve go put sticky

00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:10,100
about that unless you were added to

00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:13,700
something basically on guessing there's

00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:16,990
a old technique for guessing that would

00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:21,140
be good but I tried the flashcard thing

00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:23,990
doesn't present to break for me i'm

00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:27,640
hyper visual and because she's standing

00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:27,640
up that's telling me to shut up

00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:40,859
