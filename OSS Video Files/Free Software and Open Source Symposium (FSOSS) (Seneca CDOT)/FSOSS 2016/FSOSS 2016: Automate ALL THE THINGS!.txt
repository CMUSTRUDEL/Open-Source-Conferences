When you hear Jenkins, you probably think continuous integration and automated builds. Or you think of an English butler dressed in a penguin suit. In either case, Jenkins goes far beyond being a simple CI tool. This presentation aims to introduce beginner to intermediate Jenkins users to the wonderful world of automation that everyone's favourite CI server enables. Topics to be covered will include making projects, adding triggers and parameters, working with build pipelines and flows, amazing plugins, clever workaround and outside the box tricks.
