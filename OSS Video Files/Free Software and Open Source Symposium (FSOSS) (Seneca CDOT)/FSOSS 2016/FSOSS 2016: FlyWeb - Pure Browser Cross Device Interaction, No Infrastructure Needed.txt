Title: FSOSS 2016: FlyWeb - Pure Browser Cross Device Interaction, No Infrastructure Needed
Publication date: 2016-11-25
Playlist: FSOSS 2016
Description: 
	Speaker: Kannan Vijayan, Software Developer with Mozilla

FlyWeb is an experimental new web feature which allows a web browser to discover and connect to "nearby" web servers on your local network, not on the internet. It also extends the web platform to allow web pages themselves to host local-area servers. With these two capabilities, smart devices can expose UIs needing a custom app. A user can just use their browser to "discover" and browse nearby FlyWeb-compatible smart devices. Web pages can also publish their own services using a web API. For example, a multiplayer web-game loaded on your browser could publish a local-area server, and when people discover and connect to it with their browser, serve them a copy of itself. Everybody can play together without having to all have the same game app, or even have an account on some game website. FlyWeb is implemented on Firefox Nightly, and you can play with it today. We're looking for feedback and thoughts on the feature.

	00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:10,510
so this this talk is generally

00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:15,730
constructed as probably and then how fly

00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:17,500
web addresses demo so literally have

00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:21,130
already faced all of you have a smart on

00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:24,250
you between that and a lot of hockey

00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:27,730
best option the whole smart devices and

00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:31,990
things stop happily now we anticipate

00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:35,789
that their partner and you know again

00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:38,950
talk to each other who still isn't right

00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:42,039
this is how we share a file each other

00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:44,260
even today right if I both are in the

00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,180
same room I think photograph I'm going

00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:52,149
to email to your bro my drop box and

00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:54,699
share those words even though we're the

00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:56,750
same room we leverage the cloud because

00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:59,030
those who you are really

00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,750
and this is how we stream content to

00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:06,860
other devices I have a TV and I have an

00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:10,090
iphone that'll be me from my iphone if I

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,979
have an Android and chrome traffic

00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,679
android like a new leaf my under in

00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:16,030
Miami there's some sort of third-party

00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:18,219
programs but they're not officially

00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:22,240
supported they sort of stopped working

00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:24,819
at any time I effectively the ecosystem

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,329
of devices and interaction is starting

00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:30,310
the comfort of times this is how we

00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:33,429
build local area experiences if I want

00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,840
to build as a developer multiplayer game

00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:36,310
that a bunch of people who can play

00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,609
together things that are designed to

00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:42,310
kind of be played with people that your

00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:44,619
new the way that I do that is I build

00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,240
enough that you know I've got an android

00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:50,409
app in iOS

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,960
and I go and submit that to the

00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:56,259
application App Store process I design a

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,630
protocol anything through something of

00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:00,520
my choosing and I polish this

00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,170
application and on the user side

00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,060
everybody that wants to play this game

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,740
they have to go and say okay I'm going

00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,080
to go down let's episode we have this

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,030
app if you don't let you get it and then

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,300
you know all everybody starts the app

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,130
and it discovers the other players and

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,330
you can play it and if you play for 15

00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,340
minutes and you want to do something

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,540
else use some other piece of software

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,780
that lets you interact with each other

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,700
but that's another you play another game

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,500
up yet another thing and then that

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,880
friction you know it's not something

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,130
that people go what happens is people

00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,690
just don't do it so you don't see it but

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,489
if you don't see applications develop

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,750
like this because the user experience is

00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:38,890
just terrible and so it doesn't happen

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,019
this is the other way full of their

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,200
experiences so a good example of this is

00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:46,360
google docs they have a Google document

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,080
sensual link i sent a bunch of people

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,260
like we can all collaborate

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,120
this has problems as well as a developer

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,710
if I want to build an application that

00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,620
uses this model where if we talked in

00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:04,410
our server the server coordinates the

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,850
problem is is there stuff there's a

00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,470
liability on lines i think i have to

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,380
post because i have to put this on I

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:13,880
don't act on any of negative us or

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,880
google cloud or

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,510
I have a pay for that server if that

00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:21,510
server goes down or if any dust or

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,830
something happens to it gets hacked the

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:33,090
application effectively becomes

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:34,290
unavailable and also oh yeah right you

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,450
don't you know that this avoids the

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,980
average right like you know the users

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,599
don't need to download an app and they

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,920
can just visit a URL make you do it

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,299
regardless of what a lot more they are

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,530
but the developer has these constraints

00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,360
and on the user's side there's other

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,549
problems if you don't have internet

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,280
connection to effectively campuses if

00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:55,079
you're on a cellular internet connection

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,549
and you're paying by the bike you have

00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:01,190
to wonder like how much better than I

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,190
using am I paying for this how

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,980
this is how we're building Sparkle Isaac

00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:12,880
ranch so the lies manufacturer are

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:15,670
building a quadcopter I want to let my

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,500
users wife with their phone I build an

00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,049
app and go to the same procedure build

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,540
it for android or iOS ask permission

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:24,460
from google and android please let me

00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,060
show this to my users and they hopefully

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:31,060
say okay and then each of my users and

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,900
goes and down fences that on the user

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,970
side i have to wonder is this app

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,100
available every coming in traffic the

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,060
device or the first time I interact with

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,040
the device if I don't have to stop

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,020
download install this now and that's

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,240
that's ok 44 devices where you have

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,880
strong and extra ticket if it's your own

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,560
television or something that you're

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,810
buying and investing in I'm going to be

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,630
using on a daily basis that makes sense

00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,910
there's not going to be a lot but in the

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,680
future where there might be hundreds or

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,060
thousands of these sorts of services if

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,030
you might come in contact with the

00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,320
family the appellate even there's a

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,870
smart TV there it's a different

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,210
manufacturer from the one that you have

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,250
at home are you going to download the

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,919
app for that you're not going to be in

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,419
that hotel room again and then you know

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,610
that i was going to clutter your screens

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:21,050
going to take up space it's going to be

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,510
there when you scroll through your ass

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,490
looking for things to to run you're not

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,050
going to be filled the upshot of this is

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,090
just not going to get installed so that

00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,040
interaction is not going to happen so

00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,430
for a large class of smart device

00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,990
attractions this model doesn't really

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:40,670
it's it doesn't scale the user

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:43,310
attractions is wheelie up and this is

00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,260
the applicable to our collection drug we

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,420
take any lights put it up on the

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,710
Internet this avoids the average of the

00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,330
user doesn't have it downloaded not

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:54,380
being used coordinate through the

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:56,810
internet server and you know that sort

00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,170
of but it again as a device manufacturer

00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:02,300
this causes problems there there's a

00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,580
liability associated with every single

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,400
product action when I should a physical

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:11,270
product I have again there's a server

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,160
that is fronting asada that is life if

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,220
that server goes down or that sort of

00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,840
gets hacked my product bring on the

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:22,200
shooter side there are similar problems

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:25,350
if I don't have internet connection I

00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:28,290
if I'm on a slow and attention or like I

00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,670
hate that connection it's expensive if

00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,650
the manufacturer goes out of business

00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,020
and you've seen this happen with

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,840
examples like next my product script

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,670
right if I can you know interact with

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,810
this thing all of a sudden it's a

00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,700
discontinued product I don't like

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,200
despite the fact that I paid money for

00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:47,850
it and have it in my home my servers now

00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,640
again the server gets hacked the product

00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:53,880
registration so forcing things to the

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:58,170
cloud causes causes significant problems

00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:01,560
you know despite the fact that you're

00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:05,190
near the devices we want attractive we

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,140
also saw last week that this is a really

00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,030
serious security concern there was a

00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:12,570
massive he doesn't happen that brought

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:16,890
down you know large chunks of American

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:20,220
network services because the detox was

00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,600
conducted by IOT devices that were

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,330
hooked up in the internet nikhat hack

00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,790
and were used to nothing else so that's

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,990
just one factor depending if you get

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,910
something like it can with its own

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,330
internet gets had you can go online

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,540
actually like this is search google and

00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,160
you can actually find large chunks of

00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,130
people's home unsecure phone cameras

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,290
that is washed i think it's it's a

00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:46,590
serious security concern so there's

00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:50,880
numerous calls from the outside of all

00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:52,940
is the futures of you know cross the

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,940
best interaction is looking bulky not

00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:58,710
controlled by platform vendors that have

00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:01,650
their personal

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:05,190
the question it's close to

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:07,740
interoperability where you have to think

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:10,170
about what smartphone platform you're

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,780
running what the less your laptop is

00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:14,010
running or your desktop trying to decide

00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,410
whether you can interact with the

00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:19,560
service that's starting to and that's a

00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,720
potential future we could end up seeing

00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,700
ourselves and where our interaction with

00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,290
the environment around us and how well

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,560
we interact with the environment ground

00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:31,440
this depends on our choice of smartphone

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,330
platform or operating system and that's

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,100
not something that I believe it's a good

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,420
thing it's difficult to develop more

00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,300
because they haven't want to developer

00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:41,880
multiple platforms and you have to sort

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,220
of you know talk to these platform

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,170
addresses they install themselves

00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,970
effectively do you can't ship out with

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,250
applications to your users anymore if

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,990
you know that that relationship snow on

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,010
or direct relationship there's there's a

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,060
real man

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,210
like you have to ask me permission

00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,130
set an application Louisa and ultimately

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,410
all those combines to make it until ye

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,450
for users to use and then difficult and

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,800
they're not going to sort of about to

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,330
the adoption curve is going to be

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:12,460
affected by this we might not see it

00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:14,560
explicitly but it's built in so we can

00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,490
do better

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,800
before life is going to talk a little

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:22,040
bit about the web so in my mind the web

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,350
is an incremental dynamic application

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,810
streaming technology every time you

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:29,180
visit a web page you pull down a small

00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,370
piece of it and you execute you pull

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:35,210
that content and some code and a Ganza

00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,680
sandbox but your computer and pika know

00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,810
you you might disagree something some

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,340
people disagree but with that being a

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,350
good thing i think the web should be

00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:45,110
document so the reality is with what is

00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,300
an application streaming technology as

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:51,200
it stands today so when you visit

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:53,870
gmail.com your browser to company and

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,330
download the code and it doesn't

00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:59,270
download all the first page that you

00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,010
visit it just an almost to code required

00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,680
to render the user interface to list all

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,470
you need

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,880
and it's dynamic because the way it

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,880
downloads code incremental eat isn't

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,770
some some static create a fine thing it

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,630
depends on your actions if you click on

00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,640
the compose button it'll download the

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:17,580
piece of code required render the right

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,490
and you email user interface and sending

00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,290
email silence if you click on different

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:26,070
message it'll download the code and

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:29,070
conduct so it's a really powerful

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:32,399
flexible application streaming model

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,220
where you server can send you an

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,860
application and bits and pieces in

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:39,959
dynamically in response the way use that

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,980
application and that leads to two sort

00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:46,980
of very good responsiveness without this

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,720
pre investment of downloading and happy

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,750
downloading all of it and how that how

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,750
that

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,800
the web has cloth cross-platform every

00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,800
single always use has been to the web

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,200
version

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,630
it's security hardin right and it's not

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,279
security hardin some theoretical way

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,470
where for somebody sat down said like we

00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,990
made this really really secure it's very

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,029
harder than a way to this fundamentally

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,250
like production-based it's been

00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:15,170
introduction and then he used by

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,360
hundreds of millions of people it has

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,360
been attacked those attacks it enclosed

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,660
that have been loopholes found and

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,370
cracks in and on the API like a

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,500
cross-site scripting at madison end of

00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,570
the platform and modify to address those

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,269
attacks it's really a security that's

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:36,050
been arrived at through a trial by fire

00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:38,510
so every single one of you I i I'm going

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:40,130
to bed today download an executor to run

00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,079
on code without thinking twice about it

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,490
and that's an amazing thing that's not

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,260
something that you really think about

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,120
too much but you just pull down to

00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,649
random hookup internet and you ran it

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,899
inside your browser didn't think twice

00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:52,880
about all you're getting and that's it

00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:54,829
that's the kind of security that the web

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,870
brings that that very few other

00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:59,779
platforms can match because they haven't

00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,520
been tested it may simply have right

00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:02,950
this is

00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:07,000
the weather's doing for about 20 years

00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:08,950
30 years it's really fast right so the

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,810
JavaScript virtual machines it exists

00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:14,200
today are the fastest and language

00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:18,040
interpreters and ang it's that exists

00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,390
and if anybody you know like a village

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,100
if people want to come and shout at me

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,460
out of the pod you know you can do that

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:29,140
but going to make this claim and between

00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:30,700
that and as MJ s and web assembly we're

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,560
really talking about hour run time they

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,140
can run applications that around a

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,580
two-speed maybe it like a ten percent of

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,820
money for something else is a really

00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,950
fast a warm up as I'm sure development

00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,630
work there's multiple implementations by

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,700
multiple defenders there's lots of

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,250
software frameworks UI frameworks

00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,639
there's cross compiler and transfer

00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,649
compiler

00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:55,560
the ecosystem of libraries to build

00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:59,870
large pieces of software is good and

00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:03,750
it's getting better so the problem is

00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:06,480
the web today doesn't let devices talk

00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:10,170
to each other a browser only understands

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,029
how to address things on the unit given

00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,230
a URL you can go and fetch and stream

00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:15,449
and application from serve rural

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,670
internet but if you're standing next to

00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:20,100
someone a browser doesn't know how to

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:21,480
address their device that they have or

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,459
if you're standing next to a hardware

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,959
device it doesn't village without those

00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:29,670
enemies so and technically you could

00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:31,439
maybe write a web server and run it on

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,050
your phone and you can help me your IP

00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:36,449
address and i can go and type the IP

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,399
address into my browser and sort of load

00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:41,399
stuff but that's not a user experience

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,740
that that's realistic for any from

00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,720
seamless interaction experience so it's

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,250
not going to work but the sort of

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,310
technical capability is that we don't

00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,199
need to do a lot the service and so this

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,390
limitation existed interacting with you

00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:56,900
know smart devices

00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:59,330
the web as a platform is perfectly

00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:03,260
capable of streaming a patrol interface

00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:04,970
from drum and you're using a web page to

00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,210
fill that turn into the drones is

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:10,340
running a web services there's nothing

00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,830
fundamentally like missing there a

00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:16,160
platform level I'll east side of being

00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,649
able to connect right that's that's the

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,899
fun of this

00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,509
so fly low price to fix that wrong and

00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:24,639
it's just the only major problem behind

00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:26,589
ethics we're not trying to sort of

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,240
address no sort of you know make a grand

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:30,579
framework that everything is going to

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,680
magically work together and you're going

00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:34,959
to drive in you're all in your garage

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,490
door is going to open your televisions

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,339
going to switch to your favorite channel

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:42,220
like we're not going for this magical

00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:44,170
future sort of imagine you know the

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,050
vision that a lot of people associated

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,490
IEP and I don't like that term personal

00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,199
life Internet of Things cuz it's been

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,170
suggesting anything on the end I

00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:54,670
probably smart relations personally but

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,679
we're not going flat ground is like this

00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,869
is we're solving a very targeted settle

00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:01,199
problem how do we connect browsers does

00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:03,459
this really ensure skating on two

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,459
servers that are around the services

00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:10,149
that are exposed by in their places or

00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:12,550
people around so we could sort of be

00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:15,410
simple so first up is we have smart

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:20,120
devices server user interface via HTML

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:22,160
a gentle Rachel ssome so that's how when

00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:27,709
you present your user interface control

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:32,180
interface by second step you advertise

00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:34,879
that interface by aslam local area

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,819
advertising particles of Bonjour is a

00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:40,420
very common technology that's well

00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:43,950
supported the flexeril advertise

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,780
services on a local area

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,400
good it support corner and so far we

00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,110
haven't really done anything before the

00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,380
browser per se all of this stuff you can

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:54,060
do completely independently and actually

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,830
there's many for example any trickery

00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,200
what it will do is this nation to

00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,420
discover it will advertise nation server

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,560
with launcher

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:05,090
so the third step which is where we

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,550
actually get something that it is we

00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,800
want to allow browsers to discover the

00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,600
obsessed rumors so we had a component of

00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,980
the browser similar to a bookmark

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,350
listings that is not filled with

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:18,440
bookmarks you made before it's when you

00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:20,450
visit that this it doesn't discovery and

00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,630
shows you hear the things around you

00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:26,240
that you here are the services around

00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,340
you that mr. and when you select one of

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,900
those things at that point everything

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,230
else just falls back to being

00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:36,020
pre-existing whatnot right device sends

00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,970
you what leaves at what age can render

00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,410
your joystick information and you can

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,900
send you a video stream in that web

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,070
pages from the from its camera the web

00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,590
page can make a WebSocket connection

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,460
back to send sort of low latency control

00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,950
it

00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,390
and it could be a different life to let

00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,250
this cash lead instead of giving you a

00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:54,200
choice ticket could give you or could

00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,570
take advantage of the saturated guys

00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:00,230
when it goes on the phone and maybe use

00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:02,150
your phone as like a steering control of

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:04,339
the room whatever the developers but

00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:08,839
then that's it that's all we're going to

00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:12,470
do so one more so now that we have this

00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:14,750
idea of being able to advertise local

00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,700
area what server and have another

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,190
browser discovered and connect wouldn't

00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:23,690
serve presenta service in that way

00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:27,380
another thing flower Moses is to allow

00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:30,140
web pages to do this so have a wet case

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:35,800
be able to use an API to stand up local

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:35,800
area sir it is then consumable by a year

00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:41,790
so this is an example of what that I

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:45,660
look like like the API

00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:47,340
so navigator you call got published

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,740
server there's that lady icon can you

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,870
pass it a name of the server to my

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,970
advisor as a promise that reserved

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,920
results to a server and on this server

00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,620
object just attach an autumn fashion and

00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,840
glitter and that hamper gets executed

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:03,270
whatever somebody connects to your phone

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,190
aw sorry up next to to the service

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,750
explode by application right so this

00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,310
webpage will be loaded on your phone or

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,280
laptop your desktop it doesn't really

00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:13,260
matter but it can sort of throw out this

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,100
here's a logo there in service and one

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:21,270
or more people here you can they don't

00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:25,010
connect so what could be built with that

00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,010
so I'm going to you

00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:37,369
so this is we've actually implemented

00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:37,369
listen in our options are a protracted

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,340
yeah I don't I'm really worried about

00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:47,340
using

00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:53,060
Crixus and then great sportsman problems

00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,879
this is understanding 20 I fine at work

00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:58,549
that's most about it

00:18:55,879 --> 00:19:00,529
so so I'm going to visit a web page

00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:05,269
right and this web pages happens to be

00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:08,509
served from my like a server all night

00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:11,839
here but it could be an image and this

00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:15,679
thing here is the prompt that's that's

00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:17,359
shown by the browser when I try when the

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,859
web page tries to polish a circle think

00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,019
it's asking you know just like a quick

00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:23,359
tries to get your location though the

00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:25,129
browser make sure this is a page has

00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,349
your permission to publish the server we

00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:30,019
don't want phases to use this feature

00:19:27,349 --> 00:19:32,269
without user consent so I allowed that

00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:34,339
to happen and what we've built here my

00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:39,440
colleague bill business is a Unity game

00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:43,569
it's compiled it's a setup mario kart

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,569
style game

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,230
and it's a player game of this

00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:51,649
thing is now advertising the flower

00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:53,600
server so now my phone I'm connected to

00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:58,880
the same network here on my phone I'm

00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,909
going to run apartment tightly and you

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,980
might not be able to see this but

00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:07,370
there's a menu here and it's discovering

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:13,130
the service advertised by the games it's

00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:14,960
just fly wedgie by West Grand Prix so

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:19,549
I'm going to just select it and when I

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:23,860
selected this phone is going to connect

00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:27,110
back to that web page the web page is

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,880
serving on control interface to like

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:33,830
want this is what that looks like so I'm

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:37,190
gonna play like this so and on the end

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,780
of us what you want to solve auerbach

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,650
might be on your phone like you

00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:46,790
set up support for I left then you can

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:48,500
join up later too and all for part two

00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:52,250
of us or three of us or four of us can

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,890
play together and so the thing i have to

00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:58,340
point out is there's no infrastructure

00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,380
there's no custom apps there's no sort

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,940
of custom court calls or anything if

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,950
that's a browser running on my laptop

00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:07,150
there's a browser running on my phone

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:10,580
these two devices can talk to each other

00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,730
the server that connected to with this

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,410
phone is being served by the webpage

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:18,500
running this game that's builder by my

00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:22,010
laptop and that's it I can I can build

00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,360
this this game with no zero

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,950
infrastructure with just just the

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,700
infrastructure that we have already and

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,660
end of the sort of pre existing

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,010
technology that we've built with the web

00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,690
and built up

00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,280
Catholic this is leveraging everything

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:37,610
that develop the West has build on

00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:40,040
someone it's using as a jst 2 and WebGL

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:43,130
to sort of rather these accelerated

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,960
graphics right we're using WebSockets to

00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:48,110
send the patrol information back in a

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,230
very low latency way back to this

00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:53,960
webpage so if you are leveraging

00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,370
everything that the web is built up and

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,010
were able to create this experience

00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:03,290
without any customers regarding any sort

00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:04,430
of extra steps today so this this kind

00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,380
of interaction doesn't have to be a

00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,690
laptop with the phone it could be fun

00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,790
with them it could be a lonely player

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,010
game work he started out there may be

00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,150
loaded on on your phone on web pages you

00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,250
start on the third game and that

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,230
advertises the fly web service and one

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,550
or more people join you discovering

00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,560
connect to you and they don't have to

00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:23,720
even know what game they're playing what

00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,310
the nature not to think about do what

00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,420
can I support this game where do I find

00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,760
out on the App Store what is its name

00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,800
and so forth they just discovery connect

00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,660
to you and you play this game and then

00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,680
five minutes later you can throw it away

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,750
low turnover game

00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,240
this government that I need to play

00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:41,400
together and our not a game of some sort

00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,340
of other interaction so one example that

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,960
that you know the brainstorming these

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,210
cases Winston sort of technology is

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,390
let's say no so right now I'm giving

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:53,100
this talk and I have a projector and you

00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:56,490
know I might need a mic if this one was

00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,830
really good what didn't happen I want to

00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:02,100
get a clock if you really need I can go

00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:05,640
to my google like slides page and say

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:08,400
advertise this page like my slides as a

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,830
pile of service and everybody that wants

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,870
to listen to this pot can connect it up

00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:15,420
being discovered connectivity the page

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:18,390
would be coded to send you a new

00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:19,980
interface to my slides and as I flipped

00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,720
through the slides it would control your

00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,360
shoe and foot through the slides for you

00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,750
played in you wouldn't need

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,510
projection screen and the web page on on

00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,210
my phone see them use the me dat i Doan

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:35,179
phone to get my voice and stream that to

00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:39,890
everybody listening in so you even if

00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:42,590
there's a plow decision and people to

00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,780
hear he wouldn't need you just plug in

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:48,830
your ear earphones and and we can hold

00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:51,110
this time and enough time or in a room

00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,820
with zero infrastructures and have a

00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,980
conversation even do it in a place where

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,440
there's people milling about like Google

00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,540
walking through to the end you know we

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,520
can still have like a clean interaction

00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,870
so it's sort of the kinds of

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,040
applications that we can build with this

00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:06,040
are pretty sophisticated

00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,020
bye

00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,400
so

00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:23,100
the point of elect one of the things i

00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:28,200
want to draw an analogy two years is XX

00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:30,390
h are the kind of feature for posing

00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,640
with flywire you prototype implemented

00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,960
isn't huge like we're not doing a giant

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,760
if there's cultish server and there's

00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,080
the sort of small discovery on the

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,040
amount of code here is actually very

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:43,740
very small but the impacted the caucus

00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:47,040
visually so the reality of what sorrows

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:49,470
is with xhr and i was working in on by

00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,200
informatics at NRC

00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:56,720
writing web you eyes on this thing has

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:58,580
like five or six hundred and

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,140
before this like we would present this

00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:05,210
patrol interviews of scientists where

00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:07,230
they can see their data George giant big

00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,900
data before big data

00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,600
giant sequence databases which they were

00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,690
planning for information

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:18,500
and there was a lot of information with

00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:19,970
show and these what we would do is you

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,890
know many of you might be familiar with

00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,919
these nicknames you had pages that we

00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,660
love with themselves every 60 seconds or

00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:28,280
30 seconds they would we love themselves

00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:32,900
because there's no way to catch party of

00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:35,570
the server every time the the user would

00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,010
do something on the page and it requires

00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,410
an interaction of the surveyor would

00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:42,200
include new page the interaction is

00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:45,080
actually carry in the next HR came was

00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:49,250
180 is all it did was let me fetch some

00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:51,230
data from email but the impact that it

00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,350
had was you know it was so big that we

00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:56,230
decided to call it in web two point oh

00:25:53,350 --> 00:26:01,520
before that is web one handed one after

00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:03,500
xhr while these terms a Jackson and then

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:08,350
we call the web through point O

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,350
corners and really nice weapons

00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,110
so it doesn't take a lot and the reason

00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:18,390
that this had such a huge impact was

00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:21,250
because this cross the bridge an xhr

00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:24,100
didn't bring anything hold on on its

00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:25,840
phone it just sort of allowed the valley

00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,270
that have been built up in the web time

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,480
jobs would exist and had the ability to

00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:34,060
manipulate the Dom they've all of this

00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,800
existed was silo because it couldn't

00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,059
access the server and so you could

00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,249
really build anything

00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:40,480
so xhr came along and said like here's a

00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:42,759
little bit missing piece of the puzzle

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,889
not even leverage all this stuff and

00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:47,350
post bail and that let us build

00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:50,790
applications on no that was what led to

00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:55,790
like initial sort of search of the web

00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:59,220
so I feel the fly out as a feature has

00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:01,530
that it's not a big feature but what it

00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,470
allows it takes the value isn't built up

00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:07,250
and welcome is now currently limited and

00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:10,650
restricted to only on the internet and

00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:12,450
changes it to zeile you oh now like you

00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:15,960
can also copy to buy something here you

00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:17,500
can also just address services on and

00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,840
that wasn't possible

00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:25,560
so it sort of unleashes its a good

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:28,990
application so where we added this

00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:31,360
prototype is in Firefox nightly it's

00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,370
just in Firefox nightly because we need

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,020
a browser to actually implement this one

00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,770
we don't want to write around on our own

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:40,840
ground shipping it in Firefox or beta or

00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:42,400
Aurora our developer edition and email

00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,050
night deeds kind of hidden behind a

00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,480
crappy have to sort of change some

00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:47,800
settings on it to get it to enable

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,240
things it's a very preliminary

00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,100
implementation and there might be

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,080
situations we've got approval code

00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,870
review well that's just it needs to be

00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,210
done so we have a web page 5 of not

00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:59,650
github that I oh if you visit there you

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,740
can it'll give you instructions on how

00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:03,650
to you know get it started on the

00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,540
relevant what

00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,549
steps to take to play around with

00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,799
luggages and not of an implementation

00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:12,649
to do that demo that I just showed you

00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:14,419
we have a few other demos hello world

00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:21,169
and ask me how to get other closet or e

00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:23,330
of examples the whole world sort of code

00:28:21,169 --> 00:28:25,580
like a simple minimal flight test case

00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:28,639
is just that that's all the code unique

00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:32,899
sort of get a minimal plastic surgery so

00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:34,669
it's quite easy to mr. Margaret lost

00:28:32,899 --> 00:28:37,759
five of you have slack channel the web

00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:40,850
page let Bullough give instructions on

00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:47,090
how to get invited to and we're on IRC

00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:50,419
on was a liar server con Foley so with

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:53,119
just prototype it's basically a V 0 it's

00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:55,549
a minimal amount of work and where we've

00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:58,970
sort of basically stopped doing

00:28:55,549 --> 00:29:01,009
implementation work on it too if

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,440
validate yes that's the reason I'm

00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:06,940
getting this fashion and there

00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:09,039
in here is to put this off ask you

00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,049
something here's the pitch right what

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,509
evening is there something real your

00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:15,460
cousin it doesn't make sense to go and

00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:18,190
spend a whole lot of effort you know

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:21,100
kind of finishing this feature cleaning

00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:23,379
it does if it's it's more than just in

00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:26,520
case we have to a lot of work getting

00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:28,630
buying and chrome and other

00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,360
Mozilla doesn't do things on its fine

00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:33,280
its own for the sake of doing them like

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,830
our fundamental goal is to improve the

00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,450
web platform so if ultimately this

00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:40,660
feature is going to end up as a firebox

00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:43,530
feature it's not that right like we want

00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,530
the web if better

00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:50,940
so we don't want one aspect complete one

00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:54,070
way in which were eliciting that

00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:55,750
validation is by asking developers to

00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,820
sort of play with this feature and see

00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,440
what you can build if you have ideas for

00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,510
applications and inform the phone

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,030
desktop your phone laptop and phone

00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,530
applications that you can build on top

00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,820
of this we'd love to hear about it and

00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:09,370
if you want to just go ahead and start

00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,960
building in yourself and you know if

00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:15,250
there's obviously with you can shout

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,690
outs that's fine and that's the sort of

00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,960
feedback we're trying to listen to

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:22,210
listen and to sort encourage you to

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,530
share the idea with other films if this

00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:26,110
is exciting do you think this was a good

00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:29,590
idea we tell what people better have to

00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:32,820
see if they're interested so we're not

00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,820
this is a pretty big

00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:39,600
so if you think this is this is

00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,280
worthwhile they stop other people

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,370
so they were actually working on

00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:48,770
currently is the development of stock

00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:51,660
were certain designing read features so

00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:54,690
so I mentioned before that that printers

00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:57,559
for example already this greatly there's

00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:59,910
a biomaterial having to be serviced

00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:01,350
there's actually a feature in sight

00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:04,230
Safari that'll let you discover and

00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:07,200
connect to it but what happens when you

00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:11,270
connect to it is the URL that you visit

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,270
will look something like lexmark

00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:18,030
and that was there there's a problem

00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:21,350
because one of the course security

00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:24,200
underpinnings web is based on

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:28,610
and stability evenings and fact that

00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:31,220
when the TF is in gmail com at tie at

00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:32,790
the point a that is a Gina look on TV

00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,800
might be

00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,900
the web browser assumed them I'm

00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,210
visiting the same service and it somehow

00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:41,660
DNS get taxes something start their own

00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:45,080
yeah there they can actually be people

00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:48,150
things that the naming is allowed to be

00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:52,050
sort of messed with the web security

00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:54,350
model brings now right so if i visit

00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:56,299
lexmark got local

00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:58,280
on network to move a visit last month

00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:00,049
LOL the browser is going to think that

00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,549
i'm visiting the same conceptual service

00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:03,020
but it doesn't happen it doesn't even

00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:04,309
have to be a printer could just be some

00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,720
person running a device that's

00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:09,559
pretending and calling yourself that

00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:11,929
logo and you know what they can do is

00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:14,660
they can steal the cookie set up right

00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:16,070
and you know the whole security model in

00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,929
turn any permissions you've given to

00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,820
that first page like you know you gave

00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:23,240
it access to your location for the

00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:24,770
second patients right so the web

00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,240
security model breaks down so we have to

00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,390
answer the question of how do we address

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,390
meaning in this situation where a

00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:34,309
service you're connecting to if you know

00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:36,289
even needs a name because it doesn't get

00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:37,880
the name itself or if it does get high

00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:41,419
in itself it has to do more than just

00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:44,390
say I am right so answering these

00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:47,650
questions are you know sort of a key

00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:51,090
part of getting this to viability and in

00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:53,260
production of those to just approach

00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:55,840
currently we get on the issue by saying

00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:59,440
like some candidate themselves when you

00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,210
connect to one of these these services

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,669
the browser actually design that

00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,230
generates a new UID and that's the name

00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:07,260
assigned to that service so the server

00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:11,290
doesn't get to choose his name the

00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:13,240
things like the discover the client

00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,360
chooses the name of the sermon it has

00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,250
you

00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,200
so that we avoid that issue which is

00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,970
sort of like a really crude way of

00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,650
avoiding an issue short term and long

00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,990
term

00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:25,000
we want to have meaningful names to for

00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:27,040
these things we want to have a beautiful

00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,080
sessions we're working on that we're

00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,080
also working on the threat model give a

00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:33,670
page game call Holly server and

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,070
something your place in a hacker on that

00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:38,020
and a hacker to turn a place of listener

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,850
on your network can they steal

00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,160
information about you can correlate your

00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,540
presence on this network but ultimately

00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,830
the answers to all these might be well

00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:47,710
maybe but that's not really a big deal

00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:50,050
and so what we do have to go through the

00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:51,730
mechanics of asking these questions

00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:53,830
about where the security threats are

00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:57,340
what the mitigations are whether they're

00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:59,140
real or they're not you know provided an

00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,370
answer to all that so that's one of the

00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,710
things you're working on and one of the

00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:04,210
things we want to work on shortly as it

00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:06,460
is to sort of open the communications

00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,620
channels with other browsers we have

00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,840
teams and

00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,840
not specifically the browser

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,980
the similar but not quite same

00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:20,980
technology

00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:27,500
and we we have sterilization

00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:32,020
that's kind of lock on the security

00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,020
stuff sort of being roughly cashed out

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,960
so this is a small it's not like a giant

00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,909
project in the lab or not no it's not

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,250
like Azula

00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:43,500
betting on this is this is the future of

00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:46,560
this is mostly a think of the Delhi

00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,540
police traffic charlie

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:53,310
inside of the lab we kind of support a

00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:55,890
logical outside of the team and their

00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,380
encouragement fundamentally there's two

00:34:55,890 --> 00:35:01,400
hole hunters working on this project

00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:03,400
itself and just

00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
I

00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:15,609
that's the end of my talk thank you for

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,089
listening I take any questions I better

00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:18,089
go over

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,080
first of all this is fantastic

00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:34,080
now if you say soon kind of comes with

00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,480
other browsers but you must have had

00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,130
some casual conversations it's usually

00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,050
not brought up the other there's

00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,150
fiddling you know the thing that they're

00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:46,140
aware Lee exist we haven't made of like

00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:49,470
a proper image sort of gears then you

00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:51,780
want to be careful when you go you

00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:54,200
usually don't get four or five times

00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,200
people

00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:03,290
so you might have your story straight

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:06,700
and ideally what we'd like is like okay

00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:08,980
that interest from

00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,369
the general known

00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,369
that works

00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,950
we want to sort of golden

00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:21,260
went through some response

00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:24,160
and as well as sort of potentially some

00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:26,559
interest from device manager

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,240
but the industry sort of bundled out

00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,839
that that presents that okay there's

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,839
real interest

00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:35,099
absolutely

00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,220
ah

00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:44,920
so

00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:44,920
so because it's like such a small to go

00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:52,579
so we have the fire very very gently so

00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:56,619
once the end before we go we do need to

00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:56,619
have the security story

00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:02,570
yeah mostly oh that's addition because

00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:05,820
somebody else might be working on

00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:08,490
not they may be conveniently I don't

00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,530
physical weapons but just was not quite

00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:12,930
the same thing right like it's it's

00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,400
similar intent and that it still wants

00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:17,300
to let you interact with my sis around

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:23,820
you but the way that feels about it is

00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:25,950
it's sort of take you where else the

00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,080
idea is still that your browser receives

00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,980
that URL but instead of you typing it in

00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,340
are coming from

00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,870
link it comes from beacon near you or or

00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:37,410
something

00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:39,480
browse the web page and then that web

00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:43,589
page interacts with the device either

00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:47,660
directly to inclusion

00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:47,660
for to a server that

00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:54,840
so

00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:59,810
fundamentally later I think that's a

00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,810
good ideas are very simple and my crisp

00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:05,200
design

00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:09,010
i presently there's value in bringing

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,010
down to

00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,960
so for example if you're building a

00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,960
physical

00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,380
and

00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:22,930
building a Bluetooth

00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:24,850
with the fly web if we can at some later

00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:27,010
point can add a little to the transport

00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:30,580
but the application doesn't change it's

00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:32,500
still just about the edges WebSockets

00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,690
HTTP event you just happen to be talking

00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,960
with the server that's near you instead

00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:39,650
of a server in

00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:43,790
fundamentally animation stays alive

00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:45,860
web application all the libraries and

00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:48,950
tools and that stuff that exists both

00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:51,050
the server-side and client-side

00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,940
build these things they're pretty

00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:55,990
sophisticated these days you can bring

00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,990
them the very correctly

00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:11,040
so this is your browser on the on the

00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:18,430
indeed

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,080
there's nothing heated so the only thing

00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,720
that that was the prerequisite is

00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:25,690
they're both on the same Wi-Fi and we've

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,670
explored how to allowing this tab I will

00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:29,440
say yes good using the Wi-Fi network

00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:31,750
raisin again so they're all seeing with

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,850
Wi-Fi network and the web page the

00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,609
server that start so conceptually the

00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:38,770
server's associated with the web page

00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:45,600
it's wrong but arouser it's tied to the

00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:45,600
web based so that that server is that

00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:52,180
the browser on my phone

00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,180
Oh

00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:57,289
because that this one if you didn't have

00:39:54,799 --> 00:40:00,079
the Wi-Fi network and then you had to

00:39:57,289 --> 00:40:03,200
drop it what would work with a short

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,330
time so to have something that works

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:11,660
that my eyes we have to look

00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:11,660
or force on some other not think that

00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:19,539
that that's something we've explored but

00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:21,279
the nice thing about Wi-Fi is it exists

00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:25,119
which you really troubled the hardware

00:40:21,279 --> 00:40:27,880
support really solid bluetooth I was

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,390
like a light blue values is impossible

00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,390
tech it's not

00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,960
any cats

00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,760
so you have to talk about

00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,370
problem

00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,680
what I want

00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:59,050
we have some issues but I think we can

00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,050
get

00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:03,440
right now what do you do

00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:13,770
so I was gonna cook phone how we gonna

00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:15,930
so I first understood be without an

00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:17,970
infrastructure to be like not on the

00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:20,280
same land they all go on their own eyes

00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:22,260
peas and they're able to talk that's not

00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,420
really what's happening here so

00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,190
infrastructure insensitive but you still

00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,290
need some communication in these two

00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,869
things right thanks at their own eyes

00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:35,160
case yeah or the yeah they can have but

00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:36,660
me you mean like right now for food

00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,270
let's talk to each other either you're

00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:42,510
learning and Wi-Fi direct bluetooth for

00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:45,090
your on the same land walk to the

00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,830
internet and then right way together but

00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:49,080
you don't need to go to the unit you

00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:51,720
just need to be on the same like man

00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:54,359
that's okay

00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,560
alright when you were talking I was

00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:57,720
thinking about physical web and then

00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,700
what's in chica you talked about at the

00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,520
end I wonder why your dismissive of it

00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,470
though because it seems to me that it

00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,720
would solve your discovery problem

00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:08,220
without you having to invent so much I

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,130
realize you have invented it at night

00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:15,480
but affecting google shipping web

00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:18,510
bluetooth in chrome why not just be an

00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,460
ikan and like how your browser you can

00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:24,240
get for your device you thinkin that

00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:26,460
sends a URL and like I agree the zero

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,040
can face style Bonjour things really

00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,869
elegant but I mean I'm just thinking

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:37,099
about things that exist I'm not justice

00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:40,110
I think it's not rated but I think so i

00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:43,290
think late

00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:45,750
it's certainly possible to imagine you

00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:49,500
know both these pockets not being two

00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:50,960
different approaches to addressing the

00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,540
same issue with

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,150
trade-offs we're in one sense you can

00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,550
imagine physical web as the discovery

00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:01,280
later black button right or you can

00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:04,609
imagine playa as physical button plus

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,180
the ability for you to get the page from

00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:09,720
the thing that you got

00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:12,970
that that was def advertising in second

00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:15,339
you can sort of you know look at it

00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:18,070
either way and think about these two

00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:24,990
things together I think that the

00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:24,990
differentiation will be is that the

00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:35,140
we really bring their specific

00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:37,809
architecture down but exactly but I'm

00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:39,519
let's look at this there again I'm with

00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:42,969
you because what lucious has not been

00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:45,819
part of the web up till now but with web

00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:48,819
bluetooth it's going to be in the same

00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:51,849
way that xhr became what sockets became

00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:53,349
like etc etc so there's there's a little

00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:56,229
bit of I think there's certain things

00:43:53,349 --> 00:43:58,420
that aren't so for example if I'm

00:43:56,229 --> 00:44:00,729
fetching like a page of this is the

00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:03,030
qualification I'm fetching from this

00:44:00,729 --> 00:44:06,810
server as they look at grown

00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:09,920
the way my implement say a streaming

00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,920
video on

00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:21,390
call this name pale cream right like the

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:23,099
level of browser abstraction thats wrong

00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,630
and it's a video tag and that

00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:26,730
efficiently says the browser goes back

00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:28,410
and fetches the content from that thing

00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:31,130
and it like screams it as a video here

00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:34,170
if you're doing that over a custom

00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:37,170
Bluetooth API what's your been doing is

00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:39,990
it's not a video tag any harm is you put

00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:42,510
a canvas up and then you got that by the

00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:43,890
way the cox over bluetooth so yeah

00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,780
that's ridiculous i agree i'm just

00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:47,700
talking about the discovery of the URL

00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,070
no I I think you still need but you

00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,510
still need the HTTP network you still

00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:53,550
have the infrastructure of the web but

00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:56,190
as a way to like the reason I'm pushing

00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:57,960
it is my fear for what you're doing son

00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:59,670
I think this is amazing have a long time

00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,589
as L Developer so don't hear anything

00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,140
negative to want to go to say but I

00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:07,560
think it's hard to imagine firefox on

00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:09,780
mobile getting this done because it

00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,369
ostensibly it is an app to have to

00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:13,500
download like people aren't running it

00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:15,480
on their phones whereas if you can

00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,339
leverage infrastructure the chrome is

00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,530
shipping I realize that like in some

00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:21,359
ways your fastest way to get this done

00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:24,000
with me to implement this in chrome like

00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:25,170
to like it sounds ridiculous I know what

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,460
to say oh it was though should be off

00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:28,950
but if you want to really push the web

00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,720
platform you you all more should put up

00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:34,050
a feature flag up in chrome and try and

00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,770
get that pouch landed because I think I

00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:38,680
don't disagree though yeah

00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:41,530
this is calm simply it's not something

00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:43,990
you can push through fire click on

00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:48,520
desktop idea table as possible to do it

00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:51,100
but it's hard on so the movement of us

00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,800
one is we can actually a motive you can

00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:56,590
we can build schedule announced to

00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:00,660
describe all the web web view we can

00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:00,660
actually look at if many it has

00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:05,799
the problem there is I think Oh

00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:05,799
intentions

00:46:08,829 --> 00:46:12,900
so we can do that for desktop but we can

00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,559
and the other thing is just sort of do

00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,949
the implementation

00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:25,499
well again fun we don't want to take the

00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:28,769
step of really pushing forward limits

00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:29,939
without like this validations and add

00:46:28,769 --> 00:46:32,670
the security think there's a few thing

00:46:29,939 --> 00:46:34,529
for the security thing would be you got

00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,999
to figure out the answer network and

00:46:34,529 --> 00:46:42,170
there is an answer it's just we gotta

00:46:35,999 --> 00:46:42,170
find so that's

00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:47,420
that plus community validation

00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,420
validation

00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:54,060
that makes sense and then

00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:56,620
you know once we get all that back and

00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:59,340
process it

00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:02,120
but an excellent

00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:02,120
because this big all

00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:09,950
so that that's sort of the next

00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,950
milestone

00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,820
or I'm allocate

00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:24,090
so I mean could you

00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:28,000
oh it's great

00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,190
thank you

00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,530
