	Speaker: Kannan Vijayan, Software Developer with Mozilla

FlyWeb is an experimental new web feature which allows a web browser to discover and connect to "nearby" web servers on your local network, not on the internet. It also extends the web platform to allow web pages themselves to host local-area servers. With these two capabilities, smart devices can expose UIs needing a custom app. A user can just use their browser to "discover" and browse nearby FlyWeb-compatible smart devices. Web pages can also publish their own services using a web API. For example, a multiplayer web-game loaded on your browser could publish a local-area server, and when people discover and connect to it with their browser, serve them a copy of itself. Everybody can play together without having to all have the same game app, or even have an account on some game website. FlyWeb is implemented on Firefox Nightly, and you can play with it today. We're looking for feedback and thoughts on the feature.
