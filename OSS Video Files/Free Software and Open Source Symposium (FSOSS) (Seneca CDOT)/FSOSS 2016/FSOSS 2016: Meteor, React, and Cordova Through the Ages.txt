	00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:11,050
um hello everybody my name is Alexander

00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:13,990
I've been working for Seneca Thunder for

00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:17,619
development open Technology here for

00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:19,810
more than two years already and I was

00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:23,890
working on a big blue button project

00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:30,009
which is a web conferencing system for

00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:33,250
online learning and Maxine Yamin is my

00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:35,110
name is Maxine I'm from ogl currently

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:39,219
working at my bank account at taken

00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,690
outside I'm a Seneca graduate and has

00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:42,460
been working on between Google bottom

00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:46,379
project here at San as a research

00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:49,949
assistant for the last like three years

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,390
and today we are going to talk about the

00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:54,719
frameworks the web frameworks that are

00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,940
actually include in the title our

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:02,739
presentation it's meteor react and

00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:11,290
cordova so let's start with the first

00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:14,710
one so each energies yeah and in regards

00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,900
to those frameworks today we will try to

00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:21,759
give an overview of those technologies

00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:24,280
and share our own thoughts and some

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,470
expertise that we gained while working

00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:31,720
on BigTable html5 client with this

00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:35,500
particular set of set of tools so meteor

00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:39,790
meteor is a web framework a job in full

00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:42,960
sack framework for that allows us to be

00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:47,140
really powerful web applications in

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,990
policy torino type it's super easy to

00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,659
set up so they're easy to use and it's

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:56,030
it's important here because

00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:58,159
you probably know that nowadays when you

00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,160
if let's say I want to create a

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,260
JavaScript full stack web application

00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,619
let's setup itself the initial setup

00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,959
takes quite some time and it seems like

00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:13,180
meteor just literally came to this world

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:18,530
to solve that particular problem and

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:20,120
before going any further let's take a

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,300
brief look at the history of the

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:29,360
framework so it was actually created as

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:35,209
a travel app started then under after a

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:38,360
few years of development the the branded

00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:41,200
that product as meteor and released open

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:46,550
source was not a region open source but

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:50,540
in in two years after the initial

00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:53,840
development they decided to polish it

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:57,799
under the open source license to

00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,940
apparently gather some additional help

00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:04,820
from the open source of energy so

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,810
speaking about the technical details the

00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:10,220
framework is based on no GS so we have

00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,160
JavaScript on the server-side and

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,870
client-side there are two databases that

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,320
have native integrations into the

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:24,650
platform those are two really popular no

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:27,850
scale databases I'd cinema de and Nan

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:31,630
polkas it's also worth mentioning that

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:34,070
meteor uses its own package system and

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,620
it's called atmosphere and just recently

00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:40,390
they edit in the air support as you may

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,390
know and IAM it's arguably the largest

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,670
largest package manager at least in the

00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,070
JavaScript world and as a result these

00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,690
gave us an access to a variety of

00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,680
different

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:57,370
I just in truth and finally the

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,560
framework uses its own the Oracle of TP

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:10,090
distributed data protocol that I will

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:12,880
mention later so again meteor is soup is

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,070
super easy to use ability to set up it's

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,200
perfect for web applications perfect for

00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:21,100
mobile applications and you know even

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:24,640
even in deployment the part that is at

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:28,060
least for me usually often can be pretty

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,340
confusing because deployment with a

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,150
deployment of meteor is is just a

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:38,920
blasphemy so I mentioned a few times

00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:40,210
that meteor is easy to use let me prove

00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,300
that to you by killing to secure

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,640
examples for example you can install the

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,830
whole frame or the whole platform which

00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:53,680
is just a single command you can do it

00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:55,840
on your linux machine or I Mac OS and

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,030
there's even special version from he

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,370
knows it's it lacks a few features

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,930
because of being developed kind of in a

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,190
separate branch from the main

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:08,650
development but still very powerful and

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:11,080
to create an application itself you also

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:14,620
need just one command meteor create and

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,410
the name of your application after that

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:20,680
command you will get the folder with

00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:23,500
some initial setup with a few folder

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:27,310
folder stated by the by nature for you

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,430
and if you go to that folder named the

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:33,220
same as your project and tied me to run

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,560
you get your by default you'll get your

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,990
application running on port your sample

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,470
application I on port 3000 on your

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,520
localhost so three easy and again

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,830
deployment

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,930
done as well by one command you just

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,090
type meet your deploy and specify the

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,419
name of the server of course that's all

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:54,370
we need some submit some configuration

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:58,810
to be able to support meet your

00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:01,900
deployment but that's it and I mentioned

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,849
before the previous slide that when you

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:08,409
create an app with a single command you

00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:11,650
get some some simple simple project

00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:14,110
structure so you usually for the mutual

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:17,590
project usually have two folders it's a

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:21,190
client and server and it's pretty

00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:23,590
self-explanatory whatever file using the

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,840
server folder it's over on the server

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,759
side of an obligation and if you put

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,030
some file to the client folder it's

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,400
fully available for your front end of

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,009
course you can your suction power

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:40,560
project can be pretty sophisticated you

00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:45,879
can add different different printers and

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:48,490
there are few rules for that for example

00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,419
if you want some file to be lazy loaded

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,919
you put it in a special folder and

00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:58,060
meteor knows what to do with that

00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:03,029
particular file but yeah so but the idea

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:06,430
here is that the responsive roots and

00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:09,400
connections but if you know them it

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:14,139
meets the development of meteor really

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:16,870
enjoyable and easy for you and let's get

00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:19,779
to with you principles or you call it

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:22,620
features of the platform so I mentioned

00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:25,870
before that it's a JavaScript full stack

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:30,219
obligations so we have and it's no jazz

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:32,770
bass so you we have you write your code

00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:33,980
in JavaScript on post client-side and

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,620
server-side overall

00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,120
you're on vacation so as a result you

00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,160
don't need to learn a different language

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,960
if you know the front-end development

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,560
you don't need to learn Java Python or

00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,810
whatever and also you can even share

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,330
some of your code between client-side

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,930
and server-side pitches which also can

00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:57,410
be really useful and that feature is one

00:07:53,930 --> 00:08:00,560
of my favorites it's called client-side

00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,760
database so in meteor we have been a

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,690
base everywhere on the client-side

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:09,140
server side if you typically typically

00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,870
if you think about dailies you have you

00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:15,140
mentioned something something huge

00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:18,460
running on the server side but meteor

00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:21,940
you also have a replica in memory

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:24,500
replica of your own movie database and

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,810
meet you in the background kind of sink

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,410
so databases so we have on the client

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:33,380
side you can access to the in-memory

00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:36,440
storm it has the same API as your server

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:41,930
side database and you don't need to care

00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:43,340
about think those syncing those also

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,950
there's feature called latency

00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:50,720
compensation which is cause a title

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:54,770
previous point it's a typical web

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,840
development process when you have your

00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,870
client side it's usually communicated

00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,960
with the server side by doing doing

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:06,740
multiple requests and waiting for death

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:09,440
data to in response and then kind of

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:13,370
updating your view that's how the work

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:16,940
usually works with me here again we have

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:22,010
advantage of having a copy it is the

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:24,770
most most recent copy of your database

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:28,010
on the client side so meteor can sort of

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:30,350
simulate or guess what uses actually in

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:33,260
database so when we do any requests to

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:37,030
the server side meteor updates if you

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:40,600
just immediately but if as you say

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:42,910
immediately and then if we are wrong if

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,340
the database actually changed since the

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:50,290
last updated the client-side database it

00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:54,220
just quickly changed change the data in

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:56,350
the browser so that that makes make the

00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,160
user believe that up taking the view

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:05,380
actually is done just immediately just

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:08,440
like this and finally reactivity may

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:11,280
people call me t reactive framework by

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:15,730
that they mean that there's a few

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,680
obstructions in your goal such as

00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:21,280
reactive sources reactive computations

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:24,550
so it can be functions or variables that

00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,590
are handled by either by constantly

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:29,790
keeping update in there on the

00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:32,730
background and you don't need to

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:35,890
sometimes you don't need to care about

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:40,450
having your variables or computations

00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:42,790
have to date me or does that for you and

00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:45,100
also it's worth mentioning that the

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,680
project itself meteor as an open source

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,080
project really kind of embraces that

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,680
ecosystem around embraces the rest of

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:56,620
the open source community it we see that

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,230
by having a lot of native integrations

00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:02,680
by really big open source projects into

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:07,170
meteor those projects include such big

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:11,380
names as NPM react angular to graph kale

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:13,750
the most recent addition so we have all

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,990
those frameworks in most of them

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,920
included into the meter installation and

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,209
you can need to be you

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:25,850
in your development without any

00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:27,860
additional additional setup and so far

00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,990
we've been talking about the

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,410
architecture or particular features of

00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:35,149
the meteor framework and from the

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:39,230
software developers point of view that

00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:43,130
all the access to those features is done

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:46,010
by using meteor API which is just a set

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:49,699
of classes functions some pretty finely

00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:51,889
I provided you to you by here and by

00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:54,649
using some of those classes you don't

00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:58,010
necessarily need to use all them but

00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:59,389
they are here for you and you have a

00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:04,269
developing a meteor application you

00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:07,959
probably will use these few of them and

00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:11,540
one of the latest additions to the

00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:15,560
meteor access system is called little

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:18,800
galaxy it's a software as a service

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,769
platform developed by the same guys take

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,380
developers as our two are developed in

00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:27,019
the medium framework itself they are

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:32,930
providing you a service paid service

00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:37,519
with a few features such as special and

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:39,769
social support and it's basically a

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,510
pre-configured server for you where you

00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:44,269
can deploy your meteor application of

00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:47,829
them with some login credentials you can

00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:51,829
actually enter their website and see the

00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:54,140
connections monitor the the use of your

00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:56,300
applications because applications in a

00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,070
long time that's really useful and

00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,470
especially if you are just starting

00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:08,360
working in meteor meteor application

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:11,600
meters is not that widely used so far

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:15,649
but it's obvious that it's going really

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,600
fast and you can see the number of

00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:20,809
is that are using it right now and that

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,410
number is just growing and in general

00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:27,790
there's obviously a pretty pretty

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:32,809
optimistic and in the numbers of

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:35,360
companies using the framework the meteor

00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:37,309
the music web framework happen for you

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,860
may probably know that for any web

00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:44,089
framework the way we render things on

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:47,629
the scene the view engines they play

00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:50,360
hero and amici we can actually you

00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:53,029
actually have a choice between two you

00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,339
have the you engines it'll place or

00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:57,889
react and the Alex will continue with

00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:03,920
some more details about that about those

00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:06,379
colleges thank you alright I've maxim

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,079
said meter has integrations with an

00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:13,220
gorgeous also but we are we are going to

00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:16,910
cover just blaze and react so what is

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,889
blaze blaze is a meters arranged

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:22,790
original built-in UNG they developed it

00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:26,809
in 2011 and it went through a lot of

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:29,329
iterations react wasn't a thing at that

00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:35,600
point react appeared and was open source

00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:40,069
in 2013 blazes in spice bars at that at

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,290
the moment major developed place there

00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:44,089
was the most popular template and the

00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:49,040
engine was handlebars of that month and

00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:50,870
meter for handlebars name space bars in

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,449
order to adapt it to their dependency

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:56,870
tracking system and this is a simple

00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:59,509
example of how you define the blades in

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:02,209
space bugs on the life you can see a

00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:04,459
simple example call like an example all

00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:08,389
you need to do is just wrap your HTML in

00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:11,089
the template tag if you want to call

00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:14,269
some helper functions or e

00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:15,620
you wanna call another damn blades I

00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:19,100
want you to do is just drop them into

00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:22,040
curly braces also space bars has

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:27,050
built-in conditional statements as you

00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,430
can see on the second example and it can

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:32,660
iterate through the loop so basically

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:34,430
when you see each items items can be or

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,350
an array passed from the parent template

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,050
or it can be a helper function which

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:43,610
returns an array and then maps each item

00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:46,399
to the in our case example template I'm

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:49,670
not going to go deep in a place it does

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,800
when the reason for that is that one

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,959
meter was initially created in 2011 they

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,930
had a lot of ambitions they wanted to

00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:59,059
have their own package manager their own

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,879
view engine they wanted to be they want

00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:04,100
to solve all the problems in the world

00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:07,249
but in reality they at some point they

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:11,389
realized that they can compete with Syed

00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:13,850
frameworks as riac Jess and angular they

00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:15,649
just added integrations their own pocket

00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:22,639
man package manager atmosphere aoa to

00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:25,610
NPM so let's talk about react what is

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,339
react it's um it's not answer JavaScript

00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,769
library or framework some people like it

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:34,639
call it like this it was created by

00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:36,740
Facebook but what about you know it's

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,329
not a complete framework it's just the

00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:45,589
view in the NBC it still needs something

00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:49,910
running in the background this is an

00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:53,540
initial goal of yacht as defined by

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:56,779
Facebook the goal is to help building

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:59,389
large applications with this data the

00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:02,740
changes over time and looking at number

00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:05,539
of companies which switch to react and

00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:11,020
we can say that they manage to meet that

00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:14,270
goal so far a little bit of history so

00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:16,459
it was traded in react was created

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:19,079
initially by just one engineering

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:23,130
facebook it was into diamond

00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:26,490
they wanted to try the transfer xhb to

00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:32,730
javascript xhp was a Facebook's version

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:35,880
of PHP and the Duke him half a year and

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:38,340
in 2011 the experiment was a success and

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:42,510
2011 I react was deployed to Facebook

00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:44,970
newsfeed Instagram started using in 2012

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:48,450
and they made a decision to open source

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:52,830
it in thousand thirteen don't be

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:55,710
confused with react negative this is hot

00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,990
right now it's a completely different

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,029
technology it allows you to it's called

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,980
react native but basically it allows you

00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:04,350
to build mobile applications using the

00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:09,720
same syntax but it almost has nothing to

00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:13,919
do with the portion of your so why would

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:16,860
anyone use we are it's a simple and

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:20,250
declarative library everything in react

00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:23,880
is a component or just JavaScript class

00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:26,909
which returns some HTML code those

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,110
components can be used and the overall

00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:34,440
structure of the code the code becomes

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:36,059
more modular and more readable j16 does

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,760
and the concept of your John Doe are

00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:43,799
probably the two biggest features of why

00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:47,399
biggest reasons of why would he react so

00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:50,580
let's talk about them were just extends

00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:55,080
for JavaScript XML on the right you can

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:58,980
see it an example of simple simple react

00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:01,500
component or you can see it's just a

00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:04,080
javascript class which it stands react

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,470
component each component when you have

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,000
to suppose that have it must have

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:13,580
function reach in Stone returns HTML and

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,640
j sx allow us the return pure HTML it's

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:22,789
not a stream it's not I thought it's a

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:25,340
channel and here is an example how you

00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:27,950
pass a variable from one component to

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,500
another so we have our store component

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,960
on the left i define a simple variable

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,460
called underscore name and it hold a

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,870
short in this component from the right

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:41,679
and so the shopping list can simply

00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:49,640
access that variable x variable by

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:51,860
calling this dot props dog named talking

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:56,659
about simplicity of reactive these are

00:19:51,860 --> 00:20:01,120
all react lifecycle functions on one

00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:04,730
slide we have just four scenarios here

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,630
it's very it's very similar to iOS

00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:11,929
development I a Salamence your elements

00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:13,880
lifecycle you don't have to use all of

00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:17,210
this you don't have to know this in fact

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:19,210
it's just a tour make nine functions I

00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:22,400
think because they duplicate each other

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:24,140
but if you want to customize your view

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,440
if you wanna customize your Grampa even

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:30,530
if you want inject some JavaScript code

00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:33,320
before your component was rendered after

00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:39,500
or before it was updated router then you

00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:41,679
might want to look at it I really choked

00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:46,340
on this is probably the main feature of

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,890
react this was the reason why company

00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,980
started switching to react initially

00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:57,440
because it was super fast what does it

00:20:51,980 --> 00:21:01,630
mean the idea is react keeps a virtual

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,130
cod bo3 or tom and when something is

00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,420
changed let's say user click the button

00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,840
or the underlying

00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,790
the database was changed react computes

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:15,020
the difference in the virtual dome and

00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:16,670
then it compares what's different

00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,890
between the children and the real dumb

00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,800
and applies a difference in series of

00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:24,470
optimized transactions so you can see on

00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,300
this picture on the third it's a

00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:29,570
timeline we have it on the bottom and

00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:35,450
virtual Dom on top so each circle

00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:38,840
represents mode so on the first on the

00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:40,850
first screen we see something's changed

00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,140
let's say is you click the button react

00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:46,340
until the difference I realized that

00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:50,060
it's supposed to update not only that

00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:53,860
not but also its child and at the last

00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,860
step it applies different drilled on

00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:02,060
meter and react that's probably the best

00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:05,390
choice you can make if you want to have

00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:08,720
an efficient up as i said before

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:11,090
reactors on Dave you it still needs to

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,400
have a solid framework right in the

00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,530
background and together with meteors

00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,130
reactivity and meters latency

00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:21,650
compensation it looks like they were

00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:23,290
created for each other also you don't

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:29,360
need any standalone build tools

00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:30,770
sometimes in the conduct days to add to

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,800
create an initial setup to add

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:36,470
transpires for SES six classes to forge

00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:40,090
a sex and make it all work is not Jess

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:45,920
and with hot hot code updates and etc

00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:49,610
meter has built-in browser fight so

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,350
basically does that for you also there

00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:56,140
is a huge yoga system surrounding we are

00:22:51,350 --> 00:23:03,790
so it it's easier to solve problems and

00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:03,790
it has also sorry yeah

00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:09,770
our experience as I said we were my team

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,510
and I are working on big button and one

00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:17,200
of the one of the things you worked on

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:20,500
was people about an html5 version of the

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:25,060
client which is basically a but not a

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:28,160
meteor based standalone web application

00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:32,720
so last December we decided to switch

00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:34,910
from blaze to react frankly speaking we

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,240
almost didn't have any problems except

00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:41,510
very narrow specific cases but a couple

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:45,350
of things you want to keep in mind if

00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:47,300
you are on the same situation with react

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:51,820
you can use jQuery and that's a big one

00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:57,680
I jquery became default library for any

00:23:51,820 --> 00:24:01,400
web application it was a default maybe a

00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:05,570
year ago and in fact you can't use any

00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,610
other libraries not adapted to react the

00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:11,090
reason for that is react kids as I said

00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:13,460
react keeps a virtual virtual reference

00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,080
reference of the real dome any flags

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,510
finds out that you changed the dome

00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:21,410
directly without its knowing about it it

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:25,370
just breaks also took some time for us

00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:29,420
to get used to new patterns and do so

00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:35,930
called reactive way of thinking but

00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:38,090
usually it says usually it's that it

00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:44,510
takes like two to four weeks to get used

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:48,350
to that but yeah as you can see the list

00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:51,650
of companies switch to react and just as

00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:58,070
using rack that the point is much bigger

00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:59,690
than meters so that was one of the

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:02,900
reasons why meteor that integrations

00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:05,990
with react

00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:10,090
and all these names basically speak for

00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:10,090
themselves we act as a solid framework

00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:15,530
all right so at this point we talked

00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,740
about meat around you at the next step

00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,270
the next logical step would be to

00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:23,750
efficiently use this code to create a

00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:32,090
native mobile application and Maxim will

00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:34,970
talk about it yeah again so we the

00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:37,670
answer to that well in order to create

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,380
in order to deploy your application that

00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:43,010
you already developed with meteor and

00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:45,620
react to different platforms force

00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:48,500
mobile mobile mobile platforms are

00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:51,440
widely popular these days in order to do

00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,060
that we use córdoba córdoba is a

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,470
development platform i like to call it a

00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,690
platform because it's not just a

00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,450
framework it has all the tooling around

00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:02,420
it as well so it's a development

00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:08,210
platform for more developing mobile

00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:10,220
applications in with the typical stack

00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:13,940
of our technologies such as HTML

00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:15,680
Javascript CSS I think there's no better

00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,020
way to describe the purpose of cargo

00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,230
than the following phrase that you can

00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:25,160
see right once and run everywhere so the

00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:28,900
point here is to be that you mr. Noah

00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:32,210
you are able to write your application

00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:36,680
with the tools that you are already

00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:39,160
probably familiar with the especially

00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:42,130
curve for example front-end developer

00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:45,490
your eyelid application wants and

00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:48,940
damages buttes just compiles this web

00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:52,600
application into a set of different

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,730
versions for all the main platforms the

00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,530
platforms that are supported the present

00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,900
system that has supported are following

00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:00,550
a blackberry you going to Windows Phone

00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:04,090
and I specifically highlighted two of

00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:06,730
them iOS and Android because those two

00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:08,370
have a day jib meet your support as well

00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,590
which helps if you are developing

00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:14,410
application with meteor as well again

00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:17,830
let's start with a short introduction

00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:21,550
into the history of the framework it was

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:26,140
originally created at death camp or at a

00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:29,410
hackathon as a student project and if

00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:31,330
you guys later after the Deaf can pay

00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:34,200
the company around the product they in

00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:37,840
developing the product for two years and

00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:41,860
finally it was acquired by Adobe and

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,710
they branded to Adobe phonegap I just

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:47,470
one year after that they decided to

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:53,280
actually publish the core libraries of

00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:56,770
that system to open source they named it

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:59,040
patchy Cordova so right now we basically

00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:02,050
have two versions of this system it's

00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:06,850
okay it's patrick Aloha open source

00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:10,870
widely use the system that are there for

00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:13,570
you to use and also if wonka which is

00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:16,660
Apache Cordova plus some of the mutants

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:20,740
that Adobe provides to you for 42 east

00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:25,420
at about in process sticking about the

00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:27,180
core features of the platform again it

00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:30,570
allows you to come

00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:33,630
file to transform your web application

00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:36,780
into an age of one and you can think

00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:39,890
about the output of this process as your

00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:42,900
web application in subfolder let's say

00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:45,840
packaged together with a headless copy

00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:48,180
of the browser engine so it can be

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,150
safari for iOS or for example web key

00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,370
for Android and that package of your web

00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,220
application plus the headless copy of

00:28:53,370 --> 00:29:00,810
the browser can be run on any device you

00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:04,230
want the support by kadoya and in case

00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:07,980
you want to use some neat functionality

00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:10,760
of your phone such as for example jewel

00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:13,050
english or maybe access to your camera

00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,260
that functionality usually is not

00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:19,470
supported by browsers if you want to do

00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:21,960
that there are a compass of plugins

00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:26,040
available for you by and provided by

00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:28,530
cordova on source community and finally

00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,890
the publishing of your application is

00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:34,580
also very easy at the end of the beam

00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:38,280
process you just get a file that you can

00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:42,870
you can just upload to the to the

00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:48,870
website of your particular app store and

00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:50,730
have your application published and you

00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,980
may wonder what that means to use her

00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:55,290
duel with me here we mentioned that

00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,110
Cordova has a native integration into

00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:59,970
the detail first of all that means it's

00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:02,370
available by default so when you are

00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,080
installing media with a command with one

00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,690
command

00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:11,480
while it before you already have card

00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:14,390
over you already get her door it's card

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,990
also is integrated into the build system

00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:19,640
of the video so it it provides you

00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,640
access to different lighting options

00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:26,120
good options and you can use all of that

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:30,830
and finally there is a feature one of my

00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:32,960
favorites it's called cold push condo

00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:35,799
developers outside of the meteor world

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,380
they usually face the problem of

00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:42,470
frequent three publishing so let's say

00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:47,120
you know let's say you have some small

00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:50,870
bar on the client side and if you are a

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,480
kernel developer in order to you fix a

00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:56,179
bug and in order to update your

00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,610
application on the amp device on the map

00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:04,820
user device you actually need to always

00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:06,830
republish your your app so we need to go

00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,970
through the whole publishing process all

00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:15,950
over again instead of that with meteor

00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:18,830
as as as if you've managed before when

00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:20,720
when catawba applications running most

00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:24,909
of the view code is actually being

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:28,039
downloaded as the loaded from the server

00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:30,919
and in real time and as a result in

00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,809
order to kick some small part on your in

00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,549
your view when the client side devote me

00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:38,720
to actually publish the application you

00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:42,769
just any change to the code on your

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:48,049
server and that's it no no republishing

00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:52,940
or all over again and also some of the

00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:58,190
core features of the car logo include we

00:31:52,940 --> 00:32:01,130
all know that oh sorry so yeah we

00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:04,789
mentioned that card over the submitter

00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:08,539
is easy control with meteor is easy to

00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:10,519
use as well and we we just need one

00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:13,590
command

00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:16,499
22 ad platform that you want to develop

00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:19,799
your application for to get all the

00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:22,230
necessary tools available then in order

00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:25,200
to run your application to maybe test or

00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:28,019
debug you just add an additional

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,619
parameters parameter to the v2 rocket

00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:33,440
man and you can run it on your device if

00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:36,590
you connect it to the computer or the

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:41,999
elevator in the operating system itself

00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:44,220
and again deployment is also made by

00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:47,639
just one by just one command because

00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:50,759
when you run each of you at the ends out

00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:53,429
would you get a file that you can upload

00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:56,249
to the store as an action if you slice

00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:58,440
before you can see how many companies

00:32:56,249 --> 00:33:01,909
are using carlo it's really big

00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:08,989
community is growing all the time and

00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:12,389
it's so far you really mean notice how

00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:17,190
just treat awesome credo is it is i

00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:19,889
believe so and i want to be honest with

00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:21,989
you so it's really awesome but there's

00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:25,499
always a part in this world so the case

00:33:21,989 --> 00:33:29,070
i'll go with it in as well and there are

00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:31,619
a few drawbacks it may not be as

00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:34,850
important in your case but it's still

00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:37,679
worth knowing that so sometimes you can

00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:40,289
compare incredible application to a nail

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:44,190
file you can notice some in the solar

00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:46,950
performance also in case of small

00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:50,159
connections since most of the view is

00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:53,149
being downloaded from the server in case

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:56,609
of the cradle application the user may

00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:59,039
me see just a plane for the first few

00:33:56,609 --> 00:34:02,039
seconds the user may see just playing

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,409
page and then on the site will be loaded

00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:08,159
so it may look like the ugly in case of

00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:12,990
the slower connections and finally of

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,340
course we have access to most of the

00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:15,410
name

00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:18,460
functionality of your phone through the

00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:21,140
plugins and also to some graphics

00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,960
functions but of course there is a

00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:27,980
limitation come in comparison to the

00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,510
native applications but I want to

00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:33,140
mention here that in the previous slide

00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:36,050
you one of the companies you could

00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:39,530
notice was syndrome which is a big

00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:42,680
mobile mobile games to you and they are

00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:45,860
simply be really happy with the usage of

00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:48,560
cardoso this drawback of advanced

00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:52,790
graphic features may not be that bad in

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:56,660
your case and I feel that the features

00:34:52,790 --> 00:35:01,070
of her domain that regards is pretty

00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:04,310
optimistic so to just to conclude our

00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:08,480
presentation today I'll just summarize

00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:12,190
what we basically learn we learn how to

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,890
create a pretty powerful web application

00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:19,010
thanks to meteor and that application

00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:21,680
can have an efficient rendering engine

00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:26,570
to efficiently display the view to the

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:30,620
end endpoint browser and the users

00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:34,550
browser thanks to react and of course

00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:37,040
corridor can help us to actually deploy

00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:39,170
an application to as many different

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:44,000
platforms as possible specially mobile

00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:46,310
platforms so yeah and after today's talk

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,920
as a result we just hope that you'll

00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:53,570
find some time to check out these

00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:56,330
technologies and only that you'll find

00:35:53,570 --> 00:36:00,380
it find it useful even find it useful

00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:03,350
and hopefully enjoyable so now I think

00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:07,960
it's time for any questions from the

00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:07,960
Williams and we can

00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:16,890
what are the new patents that you

00:36:12,509 --> 00:36:19,589
experienced so yeah was the question was

00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:21,240
what were the new balance I think about

00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:24,599
you're talking about the react as we

00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:34,500
mentioned and well the standard standard

00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:38,789
way of it work you're asking about the

00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:41,759
reactor pageants right so in Riyadh how

00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:44,400
how it used to be you have an event you

00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:46,529
have a listener for that event and you

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,680
might have multiple listeners all over

00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:52,920
the application something's changed and

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,069
you just call a jquery function and

00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:59,579
change the dome directly with react you

00:36:56,069 --> 00:37:01,799
have to think of you can change the dome

00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:05,250
directly you have to change the state or

00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:07,740
you have to so generally speaking you

00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:10,259
have to explain the react templates how

00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:12,329
this application should look like at a

00:37:10,259 --> 00:37:16,500
given point of time with this given

00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:20,250
state and then you just it'll handle

00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:26,670
with you it's a completely different way

00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:29,390
of thinking designed a vacation even so

00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:32,039
you like the way basically the way to

00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:34,349
present your page and then the browser

00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:35,759
windows is different and the steps are

00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:37,589
different and as a result you need

00:37:35,759 --> 00:37:41,759
nothing different in order to make some

00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:44,069
changes to to apply to your concrete

00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:46,559
application so it's it's a real

00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:48,390
revolution the world you need to think

00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:51,029
completely different if you are a

00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:54,049
reactive element then the whole world is

00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:58,039
sinking before velocity can be awesome

00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:58,039
so yeah other questions

00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,870
all the views are generated on a

00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:07,820
five-point the server and extend to the

00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:10,460
 is that correct in case of Cordova

00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:15,590
yeah yeah basically you can think about

00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:18,050
is just the same flow as you have in the

00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:19,760
browser but you don't have your user

00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:22,370
doesn't see a browser so there's no

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,440
you're gonna cure the you are a lying or

00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:26,750
anything else but but everything else is

00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,690
just the same at very just you just you

00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:31,430
just see that as an e complication but

00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:34,250
in the background it's basically a very

00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:37,190
very similar to web application so yeah

00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:41,030
it's generating apply a bit sorry about

00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:44,810
that but but most of the most of the

00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:47,450
resources and like teachers since you

00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:49,520
know heavy heavy resources are available

00:38:47,450 --> 00:39:00,170
on the device so it's much faster in

00:38:49,520 --> 00:39:01,910
that case follow them yes yes of course

00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:04,250
you can do it with your typical web

00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:05,930
application as well so so whatever you

00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:07,600
have without functionality you have in

00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:11,840
the browser you can use in Cordova and

00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:13,880
again like the pictures and all the

00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,950
resources a carcass even better than the

00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,530
browser because they're available in the

00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:20,300
device so there's no sometimes there is

00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:26,450
only an even point of cash because it's

00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:27,340
there so yeah maybe something else so

00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:33,970
data

00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:36,670
it's always yes it's actually good you

00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:41,470
don't have to do that or you don't have

00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:43,990
to worry about that yeah basically the

00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:46,600
meteor its insurance into your client

00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:49,210
side code some store that has the same

00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,100
API as database you you just like you

00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:53,320
just use the same functions as use on

00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:56,500
the server side just as though you're

00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:58,810
inserting a database something but meet

00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:01,060
your handles sinking sinking by itself

00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:03,640
so you on the client side if you want to

00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:06,250
change something in the on the bone you

00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,960
want to change the name of the user at

00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:10,180
the chart or something like that you

00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,100
just insert it on the client side into

00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,200
that store and they're like a few

00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:16,330
milliseconds after that meteor by itself

00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:21,040
just updating on the background just

00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:23,260
thinking the those two databases so that

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,620
idea is not actually new it's also used

00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,720
by some of the other databases such as

00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:31,180
college to be for example but in meteor

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,420
it's much more integrated into the

00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,420
framework

00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:45,500
any other questions that's it seems to

00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:45,500
meet I think thank you thank you

00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,520
